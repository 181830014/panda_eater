I have multiple queries that overlap, e.g. a query for all Mylyn JIRA tasks and a query for all tasks for a particular milestone. When I schedule a task that is matched by multiple queries it is displayed multiple times in the task list. It would be great it the task list would collapse nodes that show tasks that are already displayed by other queries.
