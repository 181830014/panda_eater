Build id: M20080911-1700

From computer 1:
* access to web bugzilla and add a new Target Milestone
* assign this new TM to some bug
from computer 2
* synchronize (auto)
* the bug has no TM selected since the new TM is not available

I had to open some query and do "Update Attributes..." to see which TM has assigned for the bug
