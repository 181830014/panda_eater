one of my subprojects is a web project which depends on the other subproject. 
it is built by gradle correctly (i.e. inside lib's war the jar is present) but eclipse wtp seems to ignore this classpath contribution.

this repo can sample the problem: https://github.com/sombriks/sample-java-web-progressive-frontend
