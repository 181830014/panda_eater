We had a prototype “join point probe” tool in pre-AJDT IDE support, and it would
let you put in a pointcut, then show you the matches.  But we never quite worked
out the UI (e.g. matches showed in new view, you had to fully qualify type
names).  Julie Waterhouse and I spent a bit more time discussion how this could
work for AJDT, and thought a good way of doing it would be to allow you to
create a .ajpage (similar to a .jpage file), then select any pointcut,
right-click, and hit “show matches” to temporarily show everything the probe
matched in the Cross References view (the content would stick if the view were
not in “link with editor mode”).
