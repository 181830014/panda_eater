Open any multi-module gradle project and search for a resource with ctrl+shift+r -> enter a file name -> it will show the same file twice 
1. with "parent-project name/sub-project-name/file-name"
2. with only the module name "sub-project-name/file-name"

Note:
If the 1st one is selected, eclipse couldn't "link-to-editor" in package explorer.
