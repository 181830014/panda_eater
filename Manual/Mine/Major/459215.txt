Hi folks,

I wanted to add a local option to some coap packets.

It is possible to add one using org.eclipse.californium.core.coap.OptionSet.addOption( Foo extends org.eclipse.californium.core.coap.Options)

However it is not possible to get it, as org.eclipse.californium.core.coap.OptionSet.getOthers() is private

Is that possible to change the visibility of org.eclipse.californium.core.coap.OptionSet.getOthers() to public ?

Regards,

Mathieu Goessens
