I am a bugmaster at Red Hat and such I work on a lot of bugs at once. I have created Greasemonkey scripts for extending Firefox to work better for me (see URL for their location in fedorahosted.org repository). Aside from key shortcuts which are covered in the separate bug 278761 the main point of the script is set of buttons adding pre-filled texts and doing simple actions over bugs (e.g., "Please, give us logs in file /var/log/Xorg.0.log" and setting bug to NEEDINFO). Another IMHO great improvement above the original state of bugzilla is differentiating bugs by the different background of whole web page (e.g., in order to easily distinguish between RHEL and Fedora bugs).

There are many things which I like on mylyn (offline work) and I am trying to investigate whether it would be possible to use it instead of Firefox with Greasemonkey. Unfortunately I have no clue where to begin. Is it possible to make some extension for Mylyn? I would prefer some scripting language (Python, Javascript) over plain Java, but if worst comes to worst, I can do even that (a little).

Any ideas?
