My model is like this
@Entity
@Access(AccessType.FIELD)
public class Product
{
	@Id
	long id;
	
	@ElementCollection
	List<Long> nums;
}


My Expression is like this
ReadAllQuery query = new ReadAllQuery(Product.class);
ExpressionBuilder qbuilder=query.getExpressionBuilder();
Expression exp=qbuilder.size("nums").equal(2);
query.setSelectionCriteria(exp);

The generated sql is like this
SELECT t0.ID, t0.NAME FROM PRODUCT t0 WHERE ((SELECT COUNT(t1.ID) FROM Product_NUMS t2, PRODUCT t1 WHERE (t2.Product_ID = t0.ID)) = ?)
	bind => [2]

The sub selection 
(SELECT COUNT(t1.ID) FROM Product_NUMS t2, PRODUCT t1 WHERE (t2.Product_ID = t0.ID)) = ?
always return the count of cross join between t1 and t2 since there is no join condition between t1 and t2.

As a side effect, empty and not empty is not correct, either.
