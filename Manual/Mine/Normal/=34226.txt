I would like the code formatter to have the option of having opening brace on an
empty line, except at 'else', 'catch' et.c. (user selectable exceptions) so that
the code may look like the following manually modified code example:

	if (size < currentSize)
	{
		try
		{
			size = (long) inStream.available();
		} catch (IOException e) {
		}
	} else if (size == currentSize)	{
		++size;
	} else {
		--size;
	}
