We didn't manage to include images in the 3.0 theme work although the intention
was there.  The original idea was to provide add <imageDefinition> and
<imageOverride> elements to the themes extension point, along with an
ImageRegistry that mirrored the existing support for colours and fonts.  Whether
the existing JFace ImageRegistry can be used for this is a question that needs
to be answered - the javadoc states that images cannot be replaced.  In order to
be in line with the other theme registries this can't be the case.

In addition to the explicitly declared images, it would be good if we could
override ANY image that is accessable via some central authority (such as the
plugin ImageRegistry or imageDescriptorFromPlugin on AbstractUIPlugin). 
imageOverride elements could be specified by key (referring to imageDefinition
elements), by plugin/key combinations (referring to plugin ImageRegistry
objects) or by platform URL (available from imageDescriptorFromPlugin).  This
would allow themes to customize all workbench and plugin images.

In addition to specific overrides, we could allow themes to specify an
<imageTransformer> element.  When accessing images in a given theme, the
transformer would be run over all images as appropriate.  These transformers
could apply color/sizing transformations on the entire image set.  The initial
cost of this would be quite high, but the results could be cached.

Opinions?
