There are several Suboptimal Behaviors in the JSDoc tooltips displayed when selecting a method from a list of possible code completions:

* Various tags are listed "@raw", but should not be:
**@returns (listed raw, @return supported correctly)
**@type (don't list, should have other effect?)
**@memberOf (don't list)
**@deprecated (don't list, should affect JSDoc in Some Other Way?)
**@public (don't list)
**@name (don't list)
**@version (format?)
**@example (listed raw, should be <code>-ified)
*<code> changes the font but loses whitespace, while <pre> behaves correctly.
* Types defined with the {} wrappers are listed with the "{}".  Ugh.  I know you can't click on the tool tip, so a link is out... but how about some formatting/filtering?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Several of these tags are used regularly in system.js.  Thusly:

{}.|

Invoking code completion at the '|' and navigating to just about any function will show memberOf, lots of examples of @returns {type}...
