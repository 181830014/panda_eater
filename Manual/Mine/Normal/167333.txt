The web connector has a lot of templates (ok, only 11 right now). Maybe it should be possible
to use the web connector without all the templates for the various open source projects?

I
am planning for suggesting using Mylar to some of our non-programmers, such as analysts
and testers (but I haven't actually tried yet how well Mylar works with the products they
use -- most likely even won't work with the current versions such as Rational Functional
Tester 6.0 -- so this is most likely not going to happen right now, but maybe soon). I'll
probably also provide a custom Changelogic template for them so they wouldn't have to
change any parameters, except maybe their project_id parameter to the query.

All the
current open source repository templates are of no interest to them and it would be nice
if they wouldn't see them at all. With Eclipse 3.3 I could probably solve this with the
new product customization / XSLT features, but I think we will be stuck with 3.2-based
products for quite some time even if we'd get there soon. And maybe Mylar could provide
this separation from the start by having the templates in a separate plugin/feature called
"Mylar Connector: Common Web Templates" or something like that. On the other hand, splitting
the web connector this way could be somewhat confusing for other users, I think?
