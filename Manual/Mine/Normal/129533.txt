Currently a number of runtime features works only with the resources loaded using GMFResourceFactory (GMFResource) in particular:
- Copy/paste https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=125562
- Other model refactorings (see http://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/article.php?id=1485&group=eclipse.technology.gmf#1485 for details)

As we agree, runtime code should work with any resources loaded by any resource factories.
