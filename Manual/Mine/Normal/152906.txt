Hi,

could you please provide a connector to OTRS, a widely used trouble ticket system? 

OTRS is highly customisable thanks to so-called "Free Text Fields" which allow using this system also an issue tracker. E.g. it'd be easy to implement a structure as available in Trac, where the "ticket" is the paradigm for handling issues, too.

The main flaw of OTRS is that there's no Java-API for this Perl-based system. An XML-RPC-interface seems to be in the pipeline, but I'm not sure if and when it's planned to be released.

Demo system at http://demo.otrs.org, un/pw see here: http://mirror.xaranet.de/otrs/misc/otrs-demo.ldif or request them from OTRS.


Thanks anyway - Mylar is a real productivity booster!!!
