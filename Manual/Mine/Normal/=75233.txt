Hi,

It would be nice if we could have a way to create pointcuts and advices (at
least simple ones - primitive pointcuts) with a wizard.

Let's say we have created a new Aspect and right clicking on the editor window
we could create a new pointcut definition. By selecting a class element from the
workspace and a method signature we could create the pointcut. Then we could add
different elements to that definition.

After the definition process of the pointcut the next step would be the advice
definition.

This could save a lot of thinking time.
