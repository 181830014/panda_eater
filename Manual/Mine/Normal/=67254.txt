Help->Tips & Tricks...
Say that I am looking for something specific on this page.
This is a huge page, and I don't have time to read it all - I just want to see 
all tips relating to some topic. If I use the search, then I am presented with 
the top of the page. I still have to scroll down, looking for the highlighted 
item. It's almost as if I didn't do the search at all.

It would be nice to have a "Find..." dialog, similar to the Edit->Find (on 
this page)..." dialog in IE. It would also be nice if the accelerator key was 
^F so that it is consistent with the Find(/Replace) dialog in the text editor 
in eclipse.
