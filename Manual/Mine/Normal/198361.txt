It would be much more flexible if, when trying to open the corresponding task, Mylyn did an inclusing matching with the commit template (and/or on just the task name), instead of an exact matching.
This because, right now, if you alter the commit comment in any way (either because you want to add more information on what you changed or because the - usually short - task name isn't so clear to explain why you are committing something), you can't then link the CVS history entries to local tasks anymore.

This might lead to more hits for a single history entry (think of tasks with similar names, for instance): in this case, Mylyn could populate the search view with all tasks matching the inclusion on the commit template.
