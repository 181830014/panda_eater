For project settings you would use the lookup order
'project', 'instance' and 'default'.

Using the ScopedPreferenceStore with a ProjectScope as input would currently
result in
ProjectScope (=getStorePreferences), DefaultPreferences (unless you override the
lookup order)

see ScopedPreferenceStore.getPreferenceNodes

Note that it would be very convenient if you could create the
ScopedPreferenceStore with a project:

ScopedPreferenceStore(IProject project) // project to look in scope or null for
InstanceScope
