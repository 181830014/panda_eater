When package and project explorer views are focused on active task, it would be useful to have an option to flip setting for the top level elements to "Projects" and restore it to the previous value after "focus in active task" is turned off. This will help with alt-click behavior that isn't working for working sets and will also save some screen real estate (one row per working set and one nesting level)
