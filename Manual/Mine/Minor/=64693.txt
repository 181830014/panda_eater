Previous Location suffers from many not-very-useful behaviours.

- records top of newly-opened files as 'important location'
- misses edits at widely separated positions in same file, as important 
locations
- re-opens files which had been opened briefly, experienced no (significant) 
cursor movement, experienced no editing as 'important location'
- records minor cursor movements within a few lines as 'important location'

I experience the usefulness of this feature as about 30%. 70% of the positions 
it takes me to, weren't of any significance and just confusing. The positions 
which were significant, seem to be lost in the clutter or not show up at all.

Also if I'm not interested in the file, I don't want it to stay open. The 
horizontal editor tabs are useless enough when I have 10 files open, without X 
number of uninteresting extra files opened as a 'clutter' side-effect of 
navigation which didn't find where I wanted to go anyway.

It appears the algorithm needs a complete re-write, to reflect on a user-level 
which positions and actions are significant to the users. Because it seems 
currently grossly non-reflective of these.

(the poor usability of horizontal Editor Tabs, and minimal effective usability 
of Prev Location, are a constant gross impediment in my Eclipse work. I have to 
use the caret list or open Resource,  *every time I switch files*, giving a 
typical 65% productivity impairment in the critical area of context switching.

this is calculated by 6 - 7 cognitive actions required to use the caret list, 
or even attempt Prev Location usage - which attempt 70% is ineffective; versus 
2 cognitive actions when a clearly visible Editor Tab can be seen.

and this is at a crucial point of transferring one's train of thought, to a 
different file... these extra steps or failed attempts to find with Prev 
Location simply derail this.

i find this just so bad, it's like trying to type on a keyboard with the enter 
button located behind the computer...
