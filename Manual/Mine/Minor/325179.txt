If the javax.xml.bind bundle is used with com.sun.xml.bind on Java 5 which does not ship with a JAXB binding (only Java 6 does) a ClassNotFoundException exception occurs when a JAXBContext.newInstance() is invoked (see bug 325176).

I believe javax.xml.bind needs to specify a dependency or buddy policy in order to be able to load classes from com.sun.xml.bind.
