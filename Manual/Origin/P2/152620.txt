Hello,

WTP seems to validate the HTML tags and JSP tags balance at the same level.
Consequential it can happen that WTP wrongly thinks that tags are unbalanced.

You can reproduce it, using WTP 1.5.0 and create a new jsp, and paste the following:

<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
    pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<body>
<form>
<jsp:forward page="">
</form>
</jsp:forward>
</body>
</html>

Line 7 will be marked as an error "Missing end tag jsp:forward". However, this code is valid.
jsp:forward can be substituted by any other tag.

Best Regards,
Patric
