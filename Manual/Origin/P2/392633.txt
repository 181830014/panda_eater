Given the following scenario:

@Entity 
class A {
  B originalB;
  B currentB;
  ..
}
@Entity
class B {
  ..
}

in the case of A.currentB == A.originalB Eclipseling2.1.1 executes following selects for a find(A.class):
select from a...
select from b...

Eclipselink2.4 executes one more select:
select from a...
select from b...
select from b...

Eclipseling2.1.1 seems to realize, that originalB==currentB and that it only has to query for one B, which can be assigned to both originalB and currentB.

Eclipselink2.4 always seems to execute a distinct query for each relationship.
