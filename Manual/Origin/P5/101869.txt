I'm running RC3.
Job.setProgressGroup(IProgressMonitor group, int ticks) is used to create a 
progress group for several job items. However, when the job items show up in 
the progress view, they are not in the order of the ticks. They show up rather 
randomly. I have more than a dozen job items in the group. Not sure whether it 
matters.
