I experienced a problem where a problem was reported as an error when it 
shouldn't be (see bug 96671). I set the problem severity from Warning to Error 
to see if I could get the markers to go away. A full build was then launched. 
I have a full source workspace so a full build takes some time and in this 
particular case is unneccessary. The preference page could be optimized to 
only do a full build if problems are changed from Ignored to Error or Warning. 
All other cases could be handled by visiting the workspace looking for markers 
and changing the appropriate attribute (which can be done without even locking 
any workspace resources).
