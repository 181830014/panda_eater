When the compiler option to warn of missing Javadoc comments is turned on, even
when restricted to public members only, it also flags all the test* JUnit test
methods.  Since those rarely need to be commented, it would be nice if they
could be excluded from being checked.  Either an extra sub-checkmark (like the
one for "check overriding and implementing methods") or perhaps a fancier
regexp-based exclusion option would be nice.
