I've been tasked with creating a possible implementation of the
activity/category definitions for WSAD (the grunt work of the plugin.xml file,
that is).  In doing this I realize how amazingly helpful it would be if there
were shorthand notation for declaring that activities were bound to a given
category other than through categoryActivityBinding elements (perhaps by
allowing activities as children of category).  Declaring activityPatternBindings
suffers from the same problem.  Perhaps there could be a pattern element under
activity?
