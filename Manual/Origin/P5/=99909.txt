In RC2.

The attached screenshot shows what happens when the Link Additional Source
dialog is not wide enough to accomodate the warning "Location C:\blah may
overlap another resource.  This can cause unexpected side effects."  There is a
warning icon when the dialog is wide enough, but when the location gets too
long, the icon is the first thing to disappear!

In descending order of priority, I would expect:

1) The warning icon is always visible, to direct the user's attention.
2) (Perhaps) the actual location is dropped from the message, since it's visible
above, making the layout more predictable
3) (or) the warning message wraps.
