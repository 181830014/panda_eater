I'm not sure if it is related to landmarks or specific to Active Search view.

I just
been working on some methods in a class that is very central for the project (it is being
referenced many times). It was nice to see that methods I've been working on have been
added to landmak, but it was really annoying that the class itself appeared on active
search too. As I said, it is referenced too many times to be any useful up there and it
just add noise that screen away all the useful stuff.
