When no prenormalization extensions are defined for the ExtensibleURIResolver,
URIs beginning "/" go through normalization and end up using the root of the
filesystem as the definition of "/", even though files in the workspace should
use the workspace root or project folder as "/".  Resolution of web pages in the
webtools web site that point to "/main.html" end up going to "d:/main.html"
instead of "d:/eclipse/workspace/webtools/main.html".
