Type "dir" on a dstore-windows command shell, or "ls" on a dstore-linux command shell.

Output is parsed to show what lines are directories.

From a former RSE presentation, I think that double clicking on a shell ouptut that has been parsed as directory should perform a "cd" operation on the same command shell. This does not work.
