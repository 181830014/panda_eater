There are several hyperlink types that could be detected based on information captured by Mylyn and that could allow to link various systems. Here is few examples:

 * task in issue tracking repository
 * class or file from Mylyn task context
 * file or revision/changeset in version control system
 * a wiki page

For example, here is how similar hyperlinking is working across several Atlassian products:

 * Issue Key = Project Key-number (eg. CONF-9024)
 * Changeset Number = revision:changeset# (eg.revision:4572)
 * SVN = source:file_name (eg. source:dashboard.action)
 * Confluence = [space_key:page] (eg. [DOC:home])
 * Crucible: review:XXX (eg. review:38956)
