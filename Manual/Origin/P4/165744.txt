This is just an crazy idea I had, and I'm posting just to register it hopping someone can investigate some day.

It would be interesting to have a feature where the bug editor can show a "related bugs" list.

This list can be just a hint, lazily populated using the set of accessed tasks, by computing:

1 - Bugs it refers to by recognizing hyperlinks (bug#<number>).
2 - Bugs that refers to it (the same as (1), but "on demand" as the bugs are accessed and the links are discovered). This is interesting because usually you refer to other bugs via hyperlinking, but never knows what others refers to you.
3 - Inter-repository bug linking by recognizing other repository's URL.
