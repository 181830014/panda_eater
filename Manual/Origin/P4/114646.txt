One of the development environments I work in contains many, many windows shares
mapped to various NFS mount points via Samba.  Sadly, Samba and NFS occasioanlly
have issues (as do the machines hosting the mounts) that can result in a brief
period of time during which one or more files may "disappear" from the NFS world.

In Eclipse, this can be a major headache.  For example, if I define a user
library containing 500 JAR files and one of those JAR files disappears at the
wrong time, my only recourse is to refresh my projects and do a complete
clean/rebuild.  It would be *GREAT* if, instead, when a problem such as ...
    "Project xyz is missing required library: 'Q:\whatever\foo.jar'"
... appear in the "Problems" view, if there was a Quick Fix option to simply
attempt to refresh the offending entry instead of needing to refresh EVERYTHING
and then do a complete rebuild.

The same goes for ANY entity that is supposed to be on the classpath.  I do
realize (and applaud the fact that) there is a preference that can be set to
tell Eclipse not to consider missing path entries to be errors.  But I think
this falls outside of that domain.
