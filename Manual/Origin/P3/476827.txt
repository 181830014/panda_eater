EVL plugin generation from the EMF file (concerning the restrictions, e.g.  "attr String[1] name;" to be translated as a constraint. Effectively, the idea is to right click on the .emf file and generate an equivalent (the same restrictions gmf would apply) .evl file based on its contents. This will really boost up the process of replacing the GMF validator. Right after some general functions could exist which you can apply to the .evl through a wizard (like name uniqueness etc.).
