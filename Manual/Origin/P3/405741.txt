I have JDST and VJET installed side by side. However, I'm not using VJET for every js project yet. On Preferences > General > Editors > File Associations VJET is the default after installing VJET. That's ok. I changed it back to use JavaScript Editor from JDST. On every eclipse start this is changed back to VJET. This is pretty annoying, because already opened js files are now beeing tried to open with VJET editor during eclipse starts and then there is this dialog, vjet is not enabled for this project (kinda like this message). As so, I click skip and change back the behavior to jsdt javascript editor. Anyway, every next js file will be tried to opened with the vjet editor.

Big thank you, to not overwrite my setting here :)
