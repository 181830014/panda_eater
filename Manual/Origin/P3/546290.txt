In the tutorial Step 4 (Create Your own Function Block Types), at paragraph "Test Function Block", a description about the Forte Tester is unclear for people who don't know too much about FORTE.
In specific, the paragraph mentions the use of the FORTE Remote Tester:

"Once compiled, you can go to the FBTester, select 4diac FORTE Remote Tester in Test Configuration, and then set the IP and PORT for the 4diac FORTE that was compiled with the Function Blocks to be tested. The default is locally, but you can test them on any reachable 4diac FORTE."

My problem was to understand the last sentence where it was mentioned that the default is "locally" for a "remote" tester. My first thought was that this sentence means that the FB could be tested within the IDE without running a whole program. Unfortunately, in the IDE at "Test Configuration" only the "
FORTE "Remote" Tester was selectable, which confused me a bit.

Maybe a solution for this would be a different or enhanced description of this topic where it is clear that "locally" means, that the FORTE Remote Tester runs on your computer, not on another system like a PLC.
