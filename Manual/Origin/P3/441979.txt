Hi there,

Are there any plans to provide a documentation generator (like javadoc, doxygen, etc.) for the Epsilon languages?

The syntax of the languages makes them quite easy to read, but its difficult to document them by using plain comments (//comment or  -*multilinecomment *-).
Especially as there is no real Syntax-Highliting support.


I would like to have some framework to document Entities from epsilon languages and have a highliting support for this documentation in eclipse:

- E*L-Modules (similar to a javadoc class-header or a package.info)
- Custom-EOL-Operations (similar to javadoc method headers)
- ETL-Rules
-etc


I know this is quite a large enhancement request, but i think i would improve the maintainability of E*L-code by quite a bit.
