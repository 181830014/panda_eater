Title: How to remove BOM in Intellij Idea
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'd like to remove Bite Order Masks from my
UTF-8 files in Intellij IDEA, how can I do this? 

The problem is that if I'm trying to do it via other editors (e.g. Akelpad),
when I modify the file later in IDEA it somehow remembers that BOM
was present and adds it to my file again (((
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There is no such action to remove BOM from UTF-8 files in IntelliJ IDEA. There was a bug that BOM is removed, but it was fixed a long time ago.

When you remove BOM externally, make sure the file is synchronized with editor, try File | Synchronize.

If IntelliJ IDEA still thinks that this file has BOM, please file an issue with the steps to reproduce.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Tested on PHPStorm 8:

Right click on a file in the project tree,
click on "Remove BOM"

Title: IntelliJ IDEA IDE for Android development
Description: 
    
    
                    
Hey guys, does anyone has an experience with Android development with intelliJ IDEA IDE? Does it suit all the needs?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
IDEA is an excellent IDE overall.  Android support is quite good with the exception of the WYSIWYG layout editor which IDEA doesn't have.  This isn't a huge problem since I find that the one in Eclipse doesn't work half the time anyhow.

I've been using IDEA for a long time (many years) and happily pay for the commercial license.  I find the UI to be more intuitive and more productive than Eclipse.  Code completions are smarter, editing is generally smoother, debugging is a bit more reliable (though neither IDEA or Eclipse seems to have flawless integration with adb--probably adb problems).

Eclipse does have slightly better integration with some Android tools such as DDMS which can be hosted in a perspective in Eclipse.

If you find Eclipse confusing and frustrating to get started with, give IDEA a try.  IDE choices are highly personal so I can't promise you'll like it better, but since Android support is now included in the community edition of IDEA you've got nothing to lose but some time.

No, I don't work for JetBrains but as a long-time paying customer I can also vouch for the quality of their customer support.

I'm trying to set org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer spring bean, I have jdbc.properties in src/main/config .. when I put this file in src/main/resources and put classpath: in value my app deploys successfuly.

This works when jdbc.properties is located in src/main/resources

However I'm required to put any configuration inside src/main/config , how do I point springs towards this location in the right way?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is a classpath issue, not a Spring issue.  Add src/main/config to your classpath and it will work.  In Eclipse, this means adding it to the project Build Path-/p/div
Answer 2: 

    
    
The right answer to this is given by @matt b , 


  "What I am referring to is the fact
  that when you package the application,
  the config files are not packaged in a
  folder named src/main/config  in the
  packaged file (jar/war/etc.).
  Therefore your answer only works when
  you run the application within the
  source code, or when src/main/config 
  is in the classpath (which it is not
  by default). The correct prefix is to
  use classpath: or another location."

Title: Eclipse: is there a way to get Eclipse to output the commands given to run your program?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm having some build issues with Eclipse in that it runs my app just fine in eclipse but for some reason when trying to run using 

#&gt;java MyClass


it ends up not running due to not being able to find the class. This makes no sense so I was wondering if there was a way to have eclipse output what it's feeding into the jvm to get it to build/run.

Is this possible?

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
you can get the exact command used by Eclipse like this:


Run your program inside Eclipse.
Go to the Debug perspective.
Terminate the program, or let it end. right click on the second line. (Terminated, exit value... ) and select properties. in there you will have the full command line used.

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I don't know of any way of getting Eclipse to show any command line arguments - but I'm sure we can solve your problem in other ways.


What is the full name of your class? Is it just MyClass, or is it in some package? You need to supplied the fully qualified name, e.g.

java mypackage.MyClass

Where are the class files? You need to make sure they're on the class path, e.g.

java -classpath bin mypackage.MyClass


    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Once you have run a program in eclipse, there is configuration available from the 'debug' and 'run' menus. If you open it, you will see the classpath. From there you can determine what it did.

You can also check the box that writes the launch config to a .launch file, and look at it. It's not precisely the command line, but it will tell you what you need to know.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Eclipse does not pass anything to your java application unless you tell it to in the launch configuration. Check your classpath and your packages, like Jon Skeet already wrote.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Does not Eclipse show the commands in one of the Consoles?
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Note: if you want to see the exact java command line Eclipse is launching when running your app (from Eclipse), you can:


put a breakpoint at the beginning of your class
launch your app in debug mode
launch a Process Explorer (if you are on Windows, that is)



(source: maximumpc.com)  

You will see under the eclipse.exe (not shown in this picture) the java process.
Double-click on it, go the the Image tab, and copy-paste the value of the field "command-line".

I am using VB.NET. In Visual Studio, if I right-click a property name and click "Find All References", it searches for all instances of the property being used.

However, a property is always used either for assignment (Set method) or retrieval (Get method). Is there any way of searching for only one of these uses? e.g. search for all uses of the property in code where it is being assigned a value, not when the value is being retrieved.

Title: Do multiple Eclipse-based IDEs conflict with each other?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Based on a previous question, where I asked about IDEs to support development in multiple languages, Eclipse and Eclipse-based IDEs were mentioned in some of the answers. If I were to use these tools, would there be conflicts between them, or can they run side by side smoothly? Is it also possible to run different Eclipse instances with seperate plugins installed in each one?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
They can run side-by-side without any problems, at least in my experiences. I've run CodeWarrior and Eclipse together, and I'm running Eclipse and IBM ClearQuest Client open at the same time right now.

Each Eclipse-based application is a unique application, with its own settings, plugins, configuration files stored in its directory. You can install and configure them independently of each other without any problems, which includes plugins.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
They run side by side smoothly. You can even have different instances of classic Eclipse and they would run side by side smoothly. 

Eclipse stores all of its configuration in its installation directory, so no conflicts, and all of the workspace settings in the workspace directory so you can have as many workspaces as you need. 

update: And yes you can run as many instances with separate plugins as you need. All plugin configuration is stored in the instance's installation directory.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
They may run side by side, as long as each has its own workspace and set of projects. When you try to mix them, running multiple instances on the same source directories, things can quickly go very wrong in very nasty ways (especially if you try to run them at the same time on that source tree).

Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a file called "build_properties.xml" in my Java project, which is not a valid XML file, and it is not meant to be. It's included by a build system in another place, so I don't want to touch that file. But it is still a part of the Eclipse project.

By default, Eclipse  didn't try to validate that "build_properties.xml" is actually an XML file, but I accidentally clicked on "Validate". Now it marks this file, and the whole project, as having an error, with the little red "X" icon. This makes it difficult to spot actual errors.

I want Eclipse to ignore the XML validation error. I don't want to change the name of the file or its contents. How do I do this?

Do you have .editorconfig file in your project? Settings from there will overwrite your Code Style settings (and that is expected behaviour -- that's the whole nature/purpose of EditorConfig plugin).

I often have the piece of code like this:

it "should do something", :focus do

end


When I want to delete , :focus I usually do 


Go to line 1: 1G
Go to the colon: f:
Delete colon (using around word, so I can repeat it): daw
Delete focus (just repeat previous): ..
Delete comma (move left and replace it with space): hr&lt;SPACE&gt;.

With the cursor or the colon you can do dF,dE. The dF, part will delete backwards up to and including the comma. Then dE will delete up to the next whitespace character. The nice thing about this is that if there is no preceding comma this will still do the same thing. So with the code

You also can't add projects to your express solution so you can't have a model project, a helper project, a database project etc, in your solution.

you will need to write each of these as seperate projects, compile them and then reference them in your web application.

a pain in the neck but it will enforce good seperation of concerns.  :)

In additional to Leniel:


  I see it makes use of Unit Testing. Can an express version do this?


nope. Express version have not built in unit testing framework. Moreover Express cannot use plug-ins.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
You can use it for basic development.  Although you can't use the built-in Visual Studio Unit Testing Framework for unit testing you can use Nunit by having it load and run tests on the test DLL that you create. However, it won't be able to step into the code for debugging the tests due to restrictions in the integration with test runners.

I use eclipse kepler (CDT) in opensuse 12.3 and I too can't produce // at the beginning of an actual line by Ctrl+/. However Ctrl+Shift+7 works because on my key-board the key '/' must be typed as Shift+7.

A solution for me was the more simplier short-cut Ctrl+7 installed by 
Windows|Preferences|General|Keys|Comment/Uncomment ...
The disadvatange is that Ctrl+7 is a new short-cut.

To comment a text block I first marked it and then I used the
short-cut Strg+Shift+7, also installed by

Title: Validate JavaScript syntax in IDE (Editor)?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Are there any JavaScript editors that can validate JavaScript syntax on the fly? Things like missing brackets, etc.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Personally, I like to use emacs with flymake, which can use Spidermonkey, JsLint or Rhino to do the validation.  This does the sort of on the fly syntax checking I think you are after. If you want a liberal validation, you might want to use Spidermonkey as it is the execution engine from firefox, so it will reject anything firefox rejects.  If you want something a little stricter, Crockford's JsLint enforces good style.
(source: mnemonikk.org)  

Emacs is not for everyone however.  If you prefer something point-and-click, you might want to check out IntelliJ's IDEA.  It can do on the fly syntax checking, along with a raft of other features.  Sadly, javascript support is not available in the free version.


(source: jetbrains.com)  

A free alternative to IntelliJ is Netbeans, which purports to offer the same javascript functionality baked into the core.  I don't have experience with it, but it is free, open source, and reputedly improving in recent versions
netbean&#39;s javascript syntax highlighting http://netbeans.org/images_www/articles/61/ide/javascript/background_parser.png

If you're a Windows or ASP.NET type developer you might be more interested in Microsoft Visual Web Developer Express 2010.  It supports this features, and probably has better support for ASP.NET development than the other tools I've mentioned.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can go grab Javascript Lint then do exactly what you want and use whatever editor you want:

Javascript Lint - http://www.javascriptlint.com/download.htm
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I use Komodo Edit from Activestate. It validates, has code completion, brace matching, etc., and not just for Javascript.  

Edit: BTW I have a macro in Komodo Edit that calls JS_Beautify and does a spectacular job.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Eclipse (or it's web specialized form  Aptana) and Netbeans offer syntax checking on the fly.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I recommend Visual Web Developer Express 2010.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Here is another idea of validating your .js with c# in VS http://madskristensen.net/post/Verify-JavaScript-syntax-using-C.aspx
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
If you use Eclipse, the JSDT project provides a JavaScript nature. Like most of Eclipse's language natures, it provides a context engine with realtime validation, syntax highlighting, completion, etc.

There is no setting for this, but take a look at the documentation for writing visual studio add-ins. This would be a pretty simple one to set up.
    
    
Title: How to run/debug a streamlit application from an IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I really like streamlit as an environment for research, mixing a notebook/dashboard like output I can design quickly with pure code for its definition (no cells etc.) and the ability to influence my code through widgets while it runs.

For this purpose, I was looking for a way to run or even debug a streamlit application as its default way of startup is via the commandline:

streamlit run code.py

Is there a way to do either?

Cheers
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I found a way to at least run the code from the IDE (PyCharm in my case). The streamlit run code.py command actually calls python -m streamlit.cli run code.py, such that this can be configured to be what is run with an IDE.

In my case, the -m streamlit.cli run goes into the Interpreter options field of the Run/Debug Configuration, the code.py goes into the Script path field as expected.



Unfortunately, debugging that way does not seem to work since the parameters appended by PyCharm are passed to streamlit instead of the pydev debugger.

Edit: Just found a way to debug your own scripts. Instead of debugging your script, you debug the streamlit.cli module which runs your script. To do so, you need to change from Script path: to Module name: in the top-most field (there is a slightly hidden dropdown box there...). Then you can insert streamlit.cli into the field. As the parameters, you now add run code.py into the Parameters: field of the Run/Debug Configuration.

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I've come up with an alternative solution which allows you to use PyCharm debugging in a natural way. Simply set up a run script (which I call run.py which looks like this:
from streamlit import bootstrap

real_script = &lt;name of your script&gt;

bootstrap.run(real_script, f'run.py {real_script}', [])

and set that up as a normal Python run configuration in PyCharm.

Flutter Documentation about MacOS
Thanks in advance. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can install and use flutter on macOS. But you can not use XCode as IDE, officially they announced either use Android Studio / IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code.

For Android Studio / IntelliJ:

https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio

For Visual Studio Code:

https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode

As a suggestion iOS or other developer should use VSCode its light weighted and more understandable and android developer have their own option.




    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Dart and Flutter are officially supported by IntelliJ/Android Studio and VSCode.

I think there is some integration with VIM and Emacs, but not officially supported. There is no integration with XCode though.

I have a problem trying to launch Eclipse in Ubuntu 14.04. Splash picture pops up, then blinks, turns white - and nothing happens until kingdom come.

If you don't have any pending changes and have pushed your project already on your repo, you can also try deleting the project folder where eclipse opens a project path automatically. 

When you run eclipse again, it will work again.

Unfortunately, deleting metadata didnt work for me. Also I don't have any extra monitor so deleting my project folder was my last resort.
    
    
Title: How to create a &#39;local variables&#39; display using DWScript and its debugger
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm writing an IDE for DWScript and have got it stepping through code using the debugger. I now wish to add a display of 'local variables' (i.e those in scope). Can someone give me a pointer to the means of doing this? I can get a list of all symbols but do not understand how to get the current scope part of things.
Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Cast the IdwsProgramExecution to TdwsProgramExecution, you'll gain access to a "CurrentProg", property, a TdwsProgram which is either a TdwsMainProgram (if you're in the main) or a TdwsProcedure (if you're in a proc/func/method). Those will have a Table property, which lists the local symbols, that's the most direct scope.
That Table will have one or more Parents, which refers the parent scopes (hierarchically, in terms of source code scope).

If in a TdwsProcedure, you may also want to look at its FuncSymbol property, which will have a table of parameters (useful if you want to directly isolate the parameters from the rest of the local scope)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
For any others reading this question, I will show some supplementary info concerned with getting the value of a symbol. The symbol is found as described by Eric above but it is hard to work out how to get the actual value of the symbol. The code below is a procedure that populates a TMemo (memLocalVariables) with local variables each time it is called. There are some features missing like neat formatting of the variable value and access to calling parameters. I call this from the debugger 'dsDebugSuspended' state. The less intuitive bit is the access to the symbol data on the stack and the use of the stack base pointer.  A great way to learn how the compiler works! But, maybe there is a utility function somewhere I've not found...? Eric?

  procedure DrawLocalVariables;
  var
    ProgramExecution : TdwsProgramExecution;
    I   : integer;
    Sym : TSymbol;
    V   : variant;
    Adr : integer;
    SymbolTable : TSymbolTable;
  begin
    memLocalVariables.Lines.Clear;

    ProgramExecution := TdwsProgramExecution( dwsDebugger1.Execution );
    SymbolTable := ProgramExecution.CurrentProg.Table;
    For I := 0 to SymbolTable.Count-1 do
      begin
      Sym := SymbolTable[I];
      if Sym is TDataSymbol then
        begin
        Adr := TDataSymbol( Sym).StackAddr + ProgramExecution.Stack.BasePointer;
        ProgramExecution.Stack.ReadValue( Adr, V );
        memLocalVariables.Lines.Add( Format( '%s = %s', [ Sym.Name, VarToStr(V) ] ));
        end;

I import two different projects to PhpStorm. After that, like always I need to switch PHP version for project from 5.3 to 5.5. After doing this I saved project.

When I reopen this project I see that PhpStorm don't save this setting. I do this same operation again. But again, after reopen project I need to set proper version for project.

I check xml files in .idea folder and php version is there set to 5.5.0 . I check project.default.xml and there php version is set to 5.5.0 too.

My OS is Ubuntu 14.04 . My project files are in my /home folder and user/group of this is www-data/www-data. My user is in group root/www-data/pmucha. There is no problem with edit files (no permission problem).

I use latest version 2017.3.5 of PhpStorm.

I can't find solution to this problem. Can someone help me ?

Answer 1: 

    
    
Do you have composer.json in these projects? Most likely yes.

Thing is: PhpStorm by default synchronizes some settings from composer.json file. It can sync your PHP Language Level as well as Source &amp; Test roots.

Right now it looks like PHP version defined in composer.json is 5.3 or lower (5.3 is the lowest in PhpStorm) .. so PhpStorm resets your manually configured version to the provided one by composer.json. Such sync usually happens on project opening .. hence the feeling that IDE does not remember the settings.

https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2017/07/configuring-with-composer-in-phpstorm-2017-2/

Two possible solutions:


Either put a proper minimal PHP version into your composer.json (if you are writing your code using PHP 5.5 features .. so what's the point stating the 5.3 as lowest supported -- such code will fail if run using 5.3).

For example (small part of composer.json):

"require": {
    "php": "&gt;=5.5",
    ...
}

Or disable such synchronisation at Settings/Preferences | Languages &amp; Frameworks | PHP | Composer --&gt; Synchronize IDE settings with composer.json

after that, just press the debugger button as you would, it will ask to put the -g for you, and this time when you say YES, it will not crash. It will work as a charm.

Dev-C++ IDE requires compilation first then after it allows to run the program unlike other IDE like C-Free which automatically compiles first and run the program for you.

Use F11 shortcut key for compile and run the program for Dev-C++ IDE.

...I'm not sure what's supposed to happen, but I found in the Terminal-IDE directory tree the file:

$IDESYSTEM/android-gcc-4.4.0.tar.gz


I also found that terminal-gcc is a bash script. Looking inside it seemed to say that a gcc tree should exist in "$HOME", which is the installation directory. So, I unzipped, then un-tarred the file identified above and put the resulting directory tree as a top-level subdirectory.

Well well, what do you know? Success.

I went a little further and created soft links to the actual compiler in ~/bin for both gcc and just cc, and suddenly all my previously created "Makefile" scripts used in other projects I wanted to move over started working perfectly.

Apparently, even though I thought I'd done it right, I overlooked running this script:

./system/bin/install_gcc


It extracts the tar, like I did, but does not create the links you may need.

A credit goes to @Richard T for his enthusiasm regarding Terminal IDE. The answer is intended to enumerate the steps needed for running a C code.

To run a C code


Run Terminal IDE and extract the gcc package by executing

install_gcc
Create a directory for your projects within the Terminal IDE directory tree. Then in the directory create a source .c file with some code (filename.c here). Compile it

terminal-gcc -c filename.c
Create the executable file

terminal-gcc filename.o -o filename.out
Run the output file

./filename.out




If you'd like to use the PC (laptop) keyboard you can telnet Terminal IDE.

To Telnet Terminal IDE


From Terminal IDE start the telnetd deamon by executing

telnetd
Connect the Android device to the PC (laptop) and type

adb forward tcp:[port] tcp:8080

telnet 127.0.0.1 [port]


P.S. Telnet's default port is 23.
    
    
Title: Python 2.7 and Sublime Text 2 Setup Guide
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am new to Sublime Text 2. Basically I want to setup Sublime T2 as a Python IDE.

I have come across various questions with regards to Python and Sublime T2, but I couldn't find a guide from a beginners perspective. This is what I have done so far:


Installed Python.
Installed Sublime T2.
Installed Sublime Package Control


What steps (e.g. package installations, etc.) should I follow to complete the Sublime Python IDE Setup?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Besides Package Control, I use the following packages for Python development:


SideBarEnhancements 
All Autocomplete 
SublimeCodeIntel 
GitGutter 
Pylinter


I found SublimeCodeIntel and Pylinter to be especially helpful for writing Python code in Sublime Text. 

Besides installing these packages you should also tweak some of Sublime's preferences. For example, Python can be quite picky about whitespace. Therefore I recommend taking extra care for setting up how Sublime handles whitespace. I'm using these settings (put them in Preferences -/em/pprecode/code/prepa href="https://dbader.org/blog/setting-up-sublime-text-for-python-development" rel="nofollow"/a/p/div
Answer 2: 

    
    
You should be able to select a build system in the tools menu. 



Then, ctrl + B will build, and pull up the interpreter for you.

EDIT: ctrl + ` will also open your console, without building the project. From there, you can run Python commands with the built-in interpreter.

Description: 
    
    
                    
i'm a beginner Pascal programmer and I recently migrated to the Mac OS X. Today I spent many hours searching for a good Pascal IDE for this OS and found nothing. I used to write code with Geany on Windows and it worked like a charm, I also enjoyed the compiling and running capacity of Geany. 

Do you know any Geany-like IDE or at least one that highlights, compiles and runs pascal code on the Mac OS X?

I like Free Pascal the most, for beginning I believe it is the best because you don't have too much fancy GUI features to distract you from programming for beginners (algorithms, procedural thinking...). 

I didn't try to run this on Mac but it should work... I have used Free Pascal on Linux and Windows with satisfaction. 
    
    
Title: Does Mac OS X come with a Lisp environment built in with Emacs?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have been trying to find an environment that does not involve installing anything else on my mac for Lisp, as I will not be using it after I get the homework done (who know if I continue using it). I have tried to look but I can't find anything. Anybody know if it does have it, and how to use it within Emacs?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You have a few options for one-click Lisp environments.

If you prefer an Emacs-based environment, check out LispBox. This actually installs a separate instance of Emacs, afaik, so you probably won't have your existing Emacs settings with it.

If you want to use your existing Emacs, SLIME is available both through quicklisp (which you really should be using) or through ELPA.

If you're ok with not having an Emacs environment, and you're not going to be using the language for long, look into LispWorks personal, which has a one-click environment installer in OS X.

If you were actually asking about Scheme (or could go for either Scheme or Common Lisp), take a look at Racket (not technically a Scheme, it actually has a lot of additional features, but they do support R5RS and have a fairly short list of unsupported R6RS features). 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Emacs Lisp is rather different from regular Lisp, so it's probably not directly useful for classes or self-study if your target is something like Scheme or Common Lisp. But yes, Emacs has its own Lisp interpreter (or rather, is its own Lisp interpreter). You might want to read up on the differences between Emacs elisp and other dialects / variants to determine whether it might suit your needs.

For future reference, I found a usable workaround to use Jetbrains' Project Rider to export a source file to HTML, and then use Firefox's fullscreen screenshot feature to capture the screen.

This gave me a screenshot that was higher resolution than the IDE text editor, and contained the whole file (which was what I wanted, to show the levels of indentation and spaghetti-ness of the code) in a file approximately 2k x 6k pixels.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Why do you take screenshots for printing out code??
Just open your file in Visual Studio, Eclipse, Notepad++ and select File - Print and you'll get your file with a nice coloring (when using a color printer).
If you need it as a hard-copy on your screen just take FreePDF to print it into a pdf file.
Update
I tested it right now with the above PDF printer driver and it comes out just as expected. So i think you just using a Bulls**t pdf printer driver.

There's any number of questions about MSIL on SO but none that directly answer this.

I've been using Textpad which does have a syntax definition file for MSIL and then using ILASM in a command prompt window.

I did find a reference to ILIDE but the link is broken.

Is there an IDE or add-on / plugin to Visual Studio / Eclipse for MSIL that allows syntax highlighting, intellisense, code completion, debugging etc.?
    

        
Answer 1:

Title: CLion won&#39;t start, says &ldquo;IDE has not been initialized yet&rdquo;
Description: 
    
    
                    
After a period of a few weeks not using CLion (which, earlier, I was basically evaluating) - when I now try to start it up, I get:
IDE has not been initialized yet

(after the usual JVM warning I was getting before and didn't prevent CLion from starting up.)
Questions:

Why is this happening? And more importantly:
Can I circumvent this somehow? I tried renaming some CLion-related folders in my home directory, but to no avail.

Notes:

I have a valid license.
I'm using CLion build CL-201.6251.14 .
I'm on Devuan GNU/Linux 3 (~= Debian Buster).
I'm using an x86_64 CPU.
May be related to this (resolved) issue for IntelliJ Idea.

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Another instance of CLion may be running

While you might not see it for some reason, there is another instance of CLion already running (probably for your own user). The error message is somewhat misleading. Look for it with the ps command (e.g. ps aux | grep -i clion) or with pgrep (pgrep clion), then terminate it before re-running.

This may not be the only scenario in which you get the same error message.
    
    
Title: Change .eclipse folder in Linux
Description: 
    
    
                    
How can I change the .eclipse folder in Linux? I tried adding this line:

-Dosgi.configuration.area=/directory/directory1/eclipse/.eclipse


at the top of eclipse.ini but it doesn't work. I've also tried adding it to various other places in the eclipse.ini but still no luck.

Edit

I have added this line:

-Dosgi.configuration.area=file:/directory/directory1/eclipse/.eclipse


immediately below -vmargs. When Eclipse starts, it now reads from the correct .eclipse location and if .eclipse does not exist there, it creates it. Unfortunately, after Eclipse has loaded, another .eclipse folder is created in my home folder and Eclipse then continues to read from that folder. I suspect that my eclipse.ini file is now correct but there is another file I need to change.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The simplest thing to do is probably pass java a different user.home so that all the other myriad of places that derive a location base it off of user.home. So instead of what you have, use this in .ini file:

-Duser.home=/directory/other/here


In addition to .eclipse, you will probably find other directories created in your overridden user.home, such as .p2, .oracle_jre_usage, etc.

Other notes:

-Dosgi.configuration.area is the changes the configuration area for Eclipse, it does not effect user area. You also probably don't want to change that setting away from the default unless you really want multiple configurations (read more below).

Additionally, the normal thing to do would be to use -configuration as an argument to eclipse{.exe} and let eclipse convert it to the appropriate VM argument.

You probably want -user though to override the user area. Have a look at locations in the Eclipse help for more info (quoted below).

However, there are still things that have individual control over their location, such as secure storage, which is controlled by the -eclipse.keyring command line argument.


  Locations
  
  The Eclipse runtime defines a number of locations which give
  plug-in developers context for reading/storing data and Eclipse users
  a control over the scope of data sharing and visibility. Eclipse
  defines the following notions of location:
  
  User (-user) {osgi.user.area} [@none, @noDefault, @user.home,
  @user.dir, filepath, url]
  User locations are specific to, go figure,
  users. Typically the user location is based on the value of the Java
  user.home system property but this can be overridden. Information such
  as user scoped preferences and login information may be found in the
  user location. 
  
  Install (-install) {osgi.install.area} [@user.home,
  @user.dir, filepath, url]
  An install location is where Eclipse itself
  is installed. In practice this location is the directory (typically
  "eclipse") which is the parent of the eclipse.exe being run or the
  plugins directory containing the org.eclipse.equinox.launcher bundle.
  This location should be considered read-only to normal users as an
  install may be shared by many users. It is possible to set the install
  location and decouple eclipse.exe from the rest of Eclipse.
  
  Configuration (-configuration) {osgi.configuration.area} [@none,
  @noDefault, @user.home, @user.dir, filepath, url]
  Configuration
  locations contain files which identify and manage the (sub)set of an
  install to run. As such, there may be many configurations per install.
  Installs may come with a default configuration area but typical
  startup scenarios involve the runtime attempting to find a more
  writable configuration location. 
  
  Instance (-data) {osgi.instance.area}
  [@none, @noDefault, @user.home, @user.dir, filepath, url]
  Instance
  locations contain user-defined data artifacts. For example, the
  Resources plug-in uses the instance area as the workspace location and
  thus the default home for projects. Other plugins are free to write
  whatever files they like in this location.
  
  While users can set any of
  these locations, Eclipse will compute reasonable defaults if values
  are not given. The most common usecase for setting location is the
  instance area or, in the IDE context, the workspace. To run the
  default Eclipse configuration on a specific data set you can specify:

eclipse -data c:\mydata


    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You must put property definitions like this at the end of the eclipse.ini after the -vmargs line. If there is no -vmargs line you must add one.

So:

.... other lines ....
-vmargs
... other arguments
-Dosgi.configuration.area=/directory/directory1/eclipse.eclipse

Description: 
    
    
                    
Currently I'm developing ansible orchestration system. The project structure is something like this:

site.yml
    webservers.yml
    fooservers.yml
    roles/
       common/
         files/
         templates/

         vars/
         defaults/
         meta/

As a result I have to deal with dozens of play-books, roles, subdirectories, tasks, variable files, so on. For now, I use WinSCP as a kind of IDE (I work from Windows dev machine) This solution is far from being perfect but allow me easy navigation among files and folders. In fact I miss Visual Studio (intellisense!) very much. I tried Eclipse installed on my dev machine before but it was too slow. I found shell tools rather uncomfortable. Due to corporate constraints I can not add any more VM-s.

JetBrains-based IDEs have a YAML/Ansible plugin to add some context and syntax highlighting to Ansible playbook structure.

Vim is not considered an IDE by all, but I (work on and) use Rocannon for Ansible every day for its auto-completion, syntax highlighting, built-in help and other IDE-like features.

There's a GIF demo on the Rocannon github page to give you a feel for what it offers.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Ansible SHOULD have an IDE that validates both the YAML lint and the syntactical errors of ansible itself (version dependent). It is such a waste of time to have to run and debug and run into things over and over, the latest example being this:
    "msg": "unsupported parameter for module: register"}

When all you do is:

- name: gather rds instance facts
  rds:
    command: facts
    instance_name: "{{ wp_db_instance }}"
    register: database_facts


vs:

- name: gather rds instance facts
  rds:
    command: facts
    instance_name: "{{ wp_db_instance }}"
  register: database_facts


Notice the indentation. Which is why YAML is a pain.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Netbeans understands yaml but does not have support for Ansible Playbook or even generic projects. So I create a PHP project from exising sources and point that at my ansible playbook. 


PLUS I do all my coding apart from python in Netbeans
PLUS yaml syntax highlighting helps a lot
PLUS git integration ('cos you do keep your playbook in a scm)
MINUS no ansible awareness at all eg help with finding variable declarations

    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Here is the official list of IDE's or editors: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/other_tools_and_programs.html#popular-editors

Title: Navigating Python modules with ctags in Vim?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Vim with ctags for Python and that works very well for classes, fields, etc, but what it doesn't seem to include are Python file names aka module names.  Is this possible?  I'd far prefer to type ta &lt;module&gt; to jump to a module, rather than navigate level-by-level with a file browser like NERDtree, and I'm very accustomed to doing this in Java, which works out since class names are file names.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you generate your tags file using exuberant ctags (Is there any other way?) then try adding the --extra=+f option.  See the man page at http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ctags.html#OPTIONS for details.
    
    
Answer 2:

# Create a tags file for Python programs, usable with vi.
# Tagged are:
# - functions (even inside other defs or classes)
# - classes
# - filenames
# Warns about files it cannot open.
# No warnings about duplicate tags.

    p.add_argument('folder_to_index', type=str, default='.')
    args = p.parse_args()
    main()


Now run the following to generate a tags file by recursively processing the current directory:

ptags -R -f tags_file_to_create /path/to/index
