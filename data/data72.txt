If it has a saved configuration for the currently active file in the editor, it will automatically use it.  Otherwise, it will want you to tell it what you want.  I'd suggest getting in the habit of using saved configurations (down-arrow on the debug button) that you've set up.

I have recently switched from using Eclipse to IntelliJ, and am preferring the experience.

However, the IDE is not understanding any of the Annotations.  I am using Spring @Autowired annotation as well as some of the Spring-WS annotations and the IDE is telling me that they are unresolved.

When the project is built using Maven, it builds fine, and the Annotations are recognised in Eclipse.

  Writing a new refactoring plugin for Eclipse?  




I'm looking for a way to add one or two refactorings to the Eclipse IDE (for Java code).

My idea was going to use some of the refactorings already available to implement my own although I am not sure this is entirely possible. I googled a bit but didn't find any info on which dependencies I must add to make my plugin capable of using Eclipse's already available refactoring classes.

If I'm able to use Eclipse's refactoring classes for my own purposes I won't even have to delve deep in Eclipse's AST stuff, which would definitively be a big plus.

Anyone has any info on this? Has anyone some experience in coming up with refactoring plugins?

Title: Multiple IDE&#39;s in a software development team
Description: 
    
    
                    
My team's about to begin development on an application with a Swing client and an EJB Back end. 

I'm thinking of standardizing on using Netbeans for developing the Swing portion because of it's very user friendly swing designer functionality but still make use of Eclipse for the rest. 

Just wondering if anybody has done this and if so how well did it work?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I think the answer is going to be "it depends."

If you have relatively experienced engineers that can manage their own IDE configuration, then I would say let them use whatever they want.  I worked on a project where in the web side I was in netbeans, and in the rest of the modules I was in eclipse.  It worked ok, but there wasn't really any set "standard" because everyone was experienced enough to be able to manage their IDE.

In a setting where you have less experienced engineers then having a single IDE is great because it'll reduce the amount of time the team leads have to spend keeping the junior developers up and running, and in that case, it would be much easier to maintain a single development environment instead of multiple.

In no case would I check in the project files generated by netbeans or eclipse.  While it may seem to be nice at the start to get people up and running, when anyone wants to customize their setup at all you suddenly have a battle of configuration files in your source control, and that stinks.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You should standardize on NetBeans for a Swing Project

Yes you should standardize on NetBeans if you are doing a Java Swing Client IDE. Otherwise the entire team will not be able to take advantage of the excellent GUI designer in NetBeans. Moreover they may break the work done by the members using the NetBeans GUI tool.

I have worked on a project where we used 3 or 4 IDEs to develop a multi-million dollar Swing Client. There was a major productivity loss because NetBeans was not used by the entire team. 

Theoretically you could allow multiple IDEs for the backend work as it doesn't matter as much, but it is very nice to beable to use the NetBeans builds and to fully integrate everything in a single IDE.

Based on my experience not doing what you are proposing, and on my experience in being able to do rapid development in Swing with NetBeans I would say definitely lock in on NetBeans. 
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
While developer freedom is great, you are sacrificing a lot of functionality by not standardizing on a single IDE. Project metadata often doesn't mix well and you really do want to put the metadata in source control. If you are getting battle of configuration file changes between developers, you are doing it wrong.

You may want to consider WindowBuilder plugin for Eclipse rather than going to NetBeans for Swing development.

Say I got a file with a few classes defined in it, like so:

class A:
    def somemethod(self): pass
    ...more methods...

class B:
    def othermethod(self): pass
    ....even more methods...


How can I find out which line in the source Class A starts and ends, which line of code Class B start and ends? If load the file into an editor, marks the text "Class A" and want to insert a method into the source at the end of the definition of Class A, how do I do that? I do not think reading the source as a plain text-file will work very well. 

Are there ways to find out what classes are defined, methods they implement, what classes they subclass etc without importing and inspecting? 

The bottom line: I need to find out where things start and end to be able to manipulate the source, for instance add methods to classes, add decorators to existing methods, extract all methods from an existing class and creating a new with the same methods etc.

Well, you are a bit unspecific about your concrete setup but there seem to be few things odd with your settings.

I am not using mac and I don't know MacGDBp ... but MacGDBp suggests that it uses the old GDP-protocol. Though XDebug 2 uses by default the new DBG protocol.

You should make that explicit by setting 'xdebug.remote_handler' to your preferred protocol. In my case as I use the new protocol i feed it 'dpgp.

Here you find some information: http://www.xdebug.org/docs/remote

Also it could be that your firewall is blocking the port.

Maybe that'll do it, otherwise tell us more about the symptoms.

Additional information from the Silicon Labs MCU User Forum or Microcontrollers Knowledge Base may prove useful as well.

The SDCC Compiler User Guide* can be useful if additional command line options are desired.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I need a few people to test the below testcase in VS 2010 and VS 2010 Express and please let me know if I am experiencing a possible (and highly annoying) IDE/Code Editor bug.

Create a new VB Project and make it a Windows Form application and add a new module to the project.  In the module, paste the below code:

Public Sub Bug()  
    Dim Ninja As Object = Nothing  
    Dim Pirate As Object = Nothing
    If (Not Ninja Is Nothing) AndAlso (Not Pirate Is Nothing) Then _
        Call String.Join(","c, {"one",
                        "two", "three"})
End Sub


Now, position the cursor before the opening double quote in the word "two".  Press the tab key one time, and then press either the up arrow or down arrow.

If the bug fires, that entire line of text will be deleted.  It will not fire if the If block is omitted, or the If block uses a closing End If (instead of just the line continuation character).

I am experiencing this on VS2010 Express (VB.NET version).  I'll have to try it in VS2010 Premium at work to verify there.  I suspect that, if it is a genuine bug, it's in Intellisense, cause the up/down keys usually trigger that to pop up with suggestions.  Maybe it gets confused and just deletes the line somehow?

I thought my project file was corrupted, but I tested this in a brand new project and it still triggers.

If it is a bug, where do we report these things?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I can confirm the bug in VS2010 Ultimate Edition.

I have used Eclipse for years, and it is a solid IDE with a wide range of capabilities.  If you haven't tried it out to see how well it fits your needs, I would recommend giving it a shot.

That being said, I have recently started using NetBeans and I must say that I like it a bit better than Eclipse.  It seems to be more streamlined than Eclipse (less memory usage, faster to start up, etc).  I have not tested its built-in debugging capabilities however, so I can't say anything on that front.

Thankfully, there are a number of freely-available, quality IDEs out there.  I would recommend installing a handful and trying to perform the same basic set of tasks in each (create a new project, add in your source code, build, run, debug, etc) and see how they feel.  Pretty quickly, you should start to get a feeling about which ones meet your needs and which are lacking.

This question has been answered in the forum:

In Settings | File Types, you can specify wildcards for file names. You can associate * with the text file type, but this will probably cause some unexpected results when IDEA will start treating binary files as text. It's better to associate more specific wildcards if you can.
Also note that Ctrl-Shift-N searches through all files, regardless of whether they are associated with a file type. It's Find in Files (Ctrl-Shift-F) that searches only through files of known filetypes.

Use the standard project rename (this renames the project, but not the Project Directory). If you want to change the directory as well, close down the solution, rename the directory, open the solution, remove the old project (which is now unavailable) and add the project from the new location.
For each project for which it applies, remove and re-add references to other projects in the solution if there are any inter-project dependencies.
Adjust the project properties for each changed project.
Verify/adjust build scripts.
Verify/adjust the build order.
Clean and rebuild all.


If you do a package/class rename, make sure you do it separately (before, while everything is "still working") so that VS will update the internals as required. YMMV and there are some issues with files "linked" between projects.

Rename the physical project directory

Note: The physical path property is recorded in the .sln file so you cannot just rename the folder in Explorer.

a. Close the solution and the IDE

b. In Explorer: Change the directory name to the new name.

c. In Explorer:  Open the .sln file with a text editor.

c. Change the directory name to the new name and save.

d. Restart the IDE and open the solution from the File, Recent Files menu if it doesn't start automatically.

e. Click on the Project folder of the Solution Explorer and check the path property in the properties at the bottom. It will now be referencing to the new project folder.

Title: parse/collator for php
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm pretty much a newbie at php (at the "install an app and try to tweak it a bit" stage).
Is there a tool anywhere which can take a script which is spread over many files and show you all the code which is processed (for a given set of arguments passed to the script) in a single output? 

For example, I want to make a call to zen cart from a script in a different language, which returns a category listing without any surrounding page. So I want to be able to trace what the actual process is to generate that then strip off all the unwanted bits to create a custom script.

One thing I've found very helpful when looking at new / complicated codebases is to use an IDE with some sort of code intelligence.  I use php eclipse, and what it does is allow you to jump into function and variable definitions either by means of hyperlinking, or popups.  This can be incredibly helpful for navigating through sprawling projects because you don't have to go through all the trouble to search by hand.  

In your case, with php, the best thing to do is find the entry point for a page that pulls in your list of categories.  Once you find that, you can use eclipse to expand out the various function calls it makes.  Being a beginner, it's very helpful to read through code in this manner, as it exposes you to lots of different ways of doing things.  An additional bonus of using something like eclipse is that it provides integration with the PHP manual.  So anytime you encounter a function you don't know, you can hover over, see the manual, and also how it would be used in context.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
What you want is called a "backwards slice" ("all the code that contributes to a specific computed result") in the computing theory literature.   To compute the backward slice, something needs to parse the langauge, compute all the influences (control and dataflow) on a selected point in the program, and then display those points to you.

Slicing tools exist for langauges like C.    They may exist for Java (as academic versions).  I don't know of any that exist for PHP.

Another way to discover the code involved in an action is to run a test coverage tool.  Such a tool marks all the code (across many files) that gets executed for a specific action (usually a "unit test" but test coverage tools really don't care).   Then you simply exercise the action you care about, and look at the test coverage data.   A graphical display will make it easy to see what code was executed; the part you want is buried in all the executed code.
A PHP Test Coverage tool does exist and will provide nice displays of the covered code.

Title: Better IDE not build using Java in Linux?
Description: 
    
    
                    
First of all I love Eclipse but I'm not satisfied with its performance in Linux (Ubuntu) - It is CPU intensive and not responsive enough.

My question is if there is an IDE with most of Eclipse's functions but not built in Java. (More than a Notepad, but not a command line tool like vi or emacs).

Update: I'm looking for an IDE that I could use for Java, PHP, and Python development.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There's KDevelop, a QT4 based IDE that works on all platforms for C++ development. MonoDevelop is a .NET IDE for Linux &amp; other platforms. Komodo, a commercial option, is available for Linux and works well. It's not built with Java, so you will save several MB of RAM allocation. :) It's fast. wxStudio is an interesting option, if you choose to use the wxWindows libraries. There's also Code::Blocks for C++ work. Sun even provides NetBeans, which has plugs-ins like Eclipse for other languages, yet runs a tad faster than Eclipse.

It really depends on the language you're developing in. Honestly, the majority of IDE features you're likely seeking are already natively available in Vim &amp; Emacs... code completion, jumping to definition, breakpoints, etc. are Vim specialties. If you really want a GUI, then the languages you're using are a really important factor.

No, I don't think Eclipse can do that in batch.

Right-click on warning in Problems tab
Choose "Quick Fix"
In the "Quick Fix" window that opens up, select a fix type 
Click "Select All" to select all files that need the fix.
Hit "Finish" to apply the fix.

Users (programmers) would be able to create code files directly in Wave and add collaborators to do pair programming etc. The whole codebase would live in a Wave folder, and an extension would do the building and compiling on the fly.

i definitely would want google to get an IDE, they have mostly everything already:

- Google apps (docs, talk, mail, sites)
They just need to put it all together in a single IDE and make it online based (webapp) with offline capabilities, maybe HTML5 or gears so you can use it no matter the browser or OS you use.  Then this IDE connects to all the online tools mentioned before and you just have to write, junit test, run test, make some how-to's and wikis and commit. CodeRun is a good starter.

Git works with folders, once the (.git) folder is present in the folder with the project you want to "git", the git understands this a git folder on your local machine. It can then be synced up with a remote git repository for safe keeping. It may actually be easier to create your remote repository, clone it, then copy your project files into the cloned repository, commit the copied files then push to your remote origin.

I guess I'm kind of locked in a mindset that the debugger portion must be able to examine the statements that are provided to it in WIL as they are executed, right? So somehow i have to trap the output of the interpreter? Or is it just a matter of reading locations in memory using whatever language?
Thanks in advance.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Having been there and successfully completed the task, here are the things to keep in mind:


Build it as a plug-in/extension to an IDE your team is already familiar with and likes. They'll thank you for providing an interface consistent with what they really know how to use, plus you can focus entirely on the features that make your language different from others.
You'll have to learn the debugging protocol for your language. In our case, we had source access to the runtime for the interpreted language. In other cases, you may find documentation for GDB local or remote debugging interface, a library you can link to for the language's debugging protocols, or maybe even figure out what the call stacks look like and wrap the Windows Debugging API to analyze it behind the scenes.
Don't build in excess of what the language provides. Adding debugging features takes a lot of time, and they have a rather annoying habit of needing to be significantly altered or completely rewritten as versions of the target language are updated.

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Why are you tied so closely to this language? If it's not well supported, there are many others you can use. Anyway, to actually answer your question, the difficulty depends on whether it is a compiled or interpreted language and whether or not you have access to any source code (which it seems of course, that you don't). That said, this would be a very challenging project as you would have to reverse engineer the compiled code for it to have any meaning. Your time would be better spent learning another (better) language.

Perhaps if you can give us an idea of why you want to use this language we could give you some help?

Thank you
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Why can't you get rid of the client area?  Just resize the main form so that it's as thin as you can make it.

You may be implementing the floating windows as UserControls in the main form's Controls collection.  If so, there are two ways you can deal with this:


Implement the floating windows as actual windows.  Show them using "frmToolWindows.Show(this);" (this will keep them always on top of your main form).
If you need to keep the floaters as UserControls, you can make the client area of your main form transparent by setting the form's TransparencyKey property to some arbitrary color (Color.Red, for example) and then setting the form's BackColor property to the same color.  This will make your form transparent and able to be clicked through.

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Please don't make a UI like this.  It is very non-standard, and doesn't gain anything in the realm of usability.  You could simplify things by keeping it all in one window like Visual Studio.

Title: IntelliSense rules for &ldquo;get best match&rdquo; during member selection
Description: 
    
    
                    
First of all, I finally made this a wiki, but I believe a "simple," straightforward answer is highly desirable, especially since the result would define a unified IDE behavior for everyone. More on the simple later.

In the past, I've blogged about what it means to have a well-behaved member selection drop down. If you haven't read it, do so now. :)

Visual Studio 2010 adds new features to the IntelliSense selection process that makes things ... not so easy. I believe there's great power we can harness from these features, but without a clean set of governing rules it's going to be very difficult.

Before you answer, remember this: The rules should allow someone "in tune" with the system to take advantage of the IntelliSense power with fewer keystrokes and less time than other solutions provide. This is not just about what you're used to - If you use a system as long and frequently as I do, relearning the patterns is trivial next to the time it saves to have a great algorithm behind it.

Here are the controllable axes:


Filtering: A "full" list contains every identifier or keyword allowed at the current location, without regard for the partially typed text the cursor is within.
Sorting: We (at least Visual Studio users) are used to the member selection drop down being sorted in alphabetical order. Other possibilities are partial sorting by some notion "relevance," etc.
Selection: Based on the currently typed text, we have the ability to select one item as the "best match." Selection states are:


No item selected
Passive selection: one item outlined, but pressing ., &lt;space&gt; or similar won't fill it in without using an arrow key to make it:
Active selection: one item selected, and unless Esc or an arrow key is pressed, a . or &lt;space&gt;, etc will auto-complete the item.



My previous set of rules restricted the manipulation to the selection axis. They took into account:


Characters typed as matched against list items with a StartsWith operation (prefix matching), with variants for whether the match was case-sensitive.
Previous completions that started with the same set of characters.


The following are additionally available and potentially useful, but not all have to be used:


CamelCase matches or underscore_separation ("us"): Long, expressive identifiers? Not a problem.
Substring matches: long prefixes hindering your selection speed? Not a problem.
Information available in the summary text, where available: I lean against this but I must admit it's come in handy in the Firefox address bar, so you never know.


The rules you write should address the axes (in bold above) in order. In my previous posts on the subject, the rules were very simple, but the additional considerations will likely make this a bit more complicated.

Sorting

Answer 1: 

    
    
Just one addition or remark ... 

IntelliSense should adapt to the context. In the case of Visual Studio, places where only subtypes of a specific type or interface may be used, the dropdown list should filter by these.

IList list = new (Drop down all the types implementing IList) - not all possible types!

It supports jQuery with full intellisense, and if I remember correctly, the debugger also supports JavaScript, at least in Web applications (though I'm not sure about that). I tend to do the debugging work in a browser though, because, well, that's where the action happens anyway.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You might find debugging Javascript easier in Firebug in firefox or even in IE8's built-in debugger.

I use VS to debug Javascript a lot, I can't say I find the experience clunky.  What do you find clunky about it?
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
In addition to what has already been said, it is important to note that JavaScript has a very loose standard (to put it mildly). That being the case, "full" JavaScript InteliSense support will never be as robust as something like C# in Visual Studio or any other IDE. I expect (as has been mentioned) that support for JQuery, Prototype, and other JS libraries will be good but the core language will always be somewhat of a struggle, IntelliSense or no.

You're doing it wrong!

Seriously, you should be using source control and you should be releasing your software with a deployment tool like vlad or capistrano. 

You run your app locally, commit changes, then run deploys to your server. Once things are setup you shouldn't need to even log in to your server. 

Developing the way you're doing is going to cause many headaches and reduce your productivity. Now the snide rails developer comment, if you really cared about productivity you wouldn't be using windows in the first place...

It's not available yet, but Haven will allow you to edit files via FTP/SFTP in your browser. It will also allow you to plug into your source control if that's where your stuff is. It should be a nice alternative to the current fat client options.

It's really pretty similar, the only changes I have in my vimrc for Windows are this:

source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim 
behave mswin


If I recall correctly this makes a few small changes, like changing ctrl-v (block select) to ctrl-q since ctrl-v is used as paste on Windows.  There are a few other things, like using set guioptions to change the behavior of the menu bar.  I use these commands in Windows to turn off all the menu bars, but you can customize it how you want.

set guioptions-=T
set guioptions-=m
set guioptions-=r


You can check :help behave and :help guioptions for more info from within gvim.

If you're using VIM to do C++ and Java, I'd seriously look at using an IDE like Eclipse. The refactoring and code management capabilities are far in advance of aything that VIM will have.

I'm speaking as a VIM diehard, btw. I didn't give up on the power of VIM within Eclipse. I run VIPlugIn within Eclipse and that works very well (and is worth paying for). I still use VIM for adhoc work, and it's available on any machine I encounter, but for serious productive development the modern IDEs are the way forward.

Sometimes I'll be working with, say, a list of thousands of items in IDLE, and accidently print it out to the shell. When this happens, it crashes or at least very significaly slows down IDLE. As you can imagine, this is extremely inconvenient.

In Python 3, since print is a function, you should be able to "override" it. (I don't have it installed so I can't try it out to make sure.) Probably not recommended for real applications but if you're just trying things out, it would be okay I suppose.

It would go something like:

print = myprint

How close are you to using all your physical RAM on your machine?

It can be a resource hog as others have noted and if this is early in opening the program there may be background things like loading assemblies going on.

I am looking for a good Environment (GUI based Editor) for blackberry webapps.
e.g., is there a Eclipse plugin out there ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In my opinion, and experience, using a GUI based editor for any kind of web development is a Very Bad Idea. Get to know HTML and CSS, write your own JavaScript. There isn't a WYSIWYG editor out there that can generate markup as good as I can by hand.

Of course, the part were tools come in is testing. And getting to know the paricular inconsistencies of your platform. In that instance, check out:

You'll also want to test, test and test. For that, grab yourself the full range of BlackBerry emulators.

From my experience it seems that many BlackBerries have CSS and JS turned off by default, and quality of CSS and JS support (before 4.6 software) is just appalling.

Title: Fast compiler error messages in Eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
As a new Eclipse user, I am constantly annoyed by how long it takes compiler error messages to display. This is mostly only a problem for long errors that don't fit in the status bar or the "Problems" tab. But I get enough long errors in Java&mdash;especially with generics&mdash;that this is a nagging issue. (Note: The correct answer to this question is not "get better at using generics." ;-) 

The ways I have found to display an error are:


Press Ctrl+. or execute the command "Next Annotation". The next error is highlighted and its associated message appears in the status bar (if it is short enough). The error is also highlighted in the "Problems" tab, if it is open, but the tab is not automatically brought to the top.
Hover the mouse over the error. After a noticeable lag, the error message appears as a "tool tip", along with any associated "Quick Fixes."
Hover the mouse over the error icon on the left side of the editing pane. After a noticeable lag, all of the error messages for that line appear as a "tool tip." Clicking on the icon brings up "Quick Fixes."


What I would like is for Ctrl+. to automatically and instantly bring up the complete error message (I don't care where). Is this a configurable option?

[UPDATE] @asterite's "Ctrl+. F2" is almost it. How do I make "Next Annotation, then Show Tooltip Description" a macro bound to a single keystroke?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Well, you can press F2 to display the popup that normally shows javadoc. If there's an error, it will display the error message with available quick fixes.

So you can do Ctrl+., F2 repeatedly to achieve what you want.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Yeah nagging problem. Ctrl+1 brings up the quick fixes if you use it from the same line. Sometimes I have to resort to copying the error message from the problems view :(

Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a project group that contains a project I'm working on as well as some related component and packages. I prefer to keep the database links active during design-time. 

I know how to write the code which would change the database file location, but in this case, I'm just using ".\data" instead, for various design-time reasons. Unfortunately, using a relative folder means that Delphi needs to be "pointing" to the same folder that the project is in.

I'd like to be able to force the folder location to a different root, without using the "Save As" feature. Does anyone happen to know where the Delphi IDE retrieves that info?

Answer 4: 

    
    
I'd say you should just hard-code the full path to the database. Not pretty, but it will always work. There are tools, like GExperts, that will ensure your database components are set to inactive when you save them, and that way you can be sure to set them correctly on the live computer at runtime.

It would be nice to use relative paths, but that would be a function of the component and not the application really.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Do NOT use a path relative to .exe path.  That will get you into trouble with Windows XP in limited access mode, as well as with Windows Vista.

Do you need one database for all users?
Use  a path relative to All Users\Application Data directory.

Do you need separate databases per user?
Use a path relative to user's private User\Application Data directory.

Do you need multiple databases per user?
Use a path relative to user's My Documents directory.

Use any of the above as default, but add registry keys that allow you to override the settings.

I've found a dirty trick - I am aware this is a very, very non-pythonic and not appropriate way of doing this. But it does the trick for me in this example. Again this code is only temporarily used for testing and will be removed once I'm happy with the code.

Module I run is as follow:

data = pd.read_excel(path, index_col=0) #Data is loaded only once

while True:
    reload(TestModule)
    TestModule.test_function(data)
    input("Press Enter to rerun the test")


Now in TestModule I have test_function where I can reload ModyfiedModule I am working on and any function I want to test.

TestModule:

def test_function(data):
    from ModyfiedModule import MyClass

    #Run bunch of tests from MyClass
    #Code to test MyClass is here


In this case, I load data only once and I can modify MyClass module and perform various test defined in TestModule without need to reload data each time.

The only thing I need to do after modifying code is to save MyClass and TestModule and press Enter in the console to rerun the test.

const myCustomElement = document.createElement('my-custom-element');
//                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The myCustomElement would be an instance of MyCustomElement at runtime (a derivation of HTMLElement); but, type-hinting the myCustomElement makes the JetBrains IDE of PhpStorm to complain:


  Initializer type HTMLElement is not assignable to variable type MyCustomElement


Surprisingly, the IDE is totally fine on the built-in types:

/** @type {HTMLDivElement} */
const myDiv = document.createElement('div');


So, what should I do to have the very appropriate "typing hints" to the IDE (not using *) while having the warning resolved?!

I could've instantiate the myCustomElement using the new operator; and it seems to work, but there is no reference on the differences between the approaches (on whether to use new or to use document.createElement(), and why or why-not to choose one over the other?!)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Closure doesn't understand that you're instantiating an instance of MyCustomElement from the document.createElement because it does not understand customElements.define's implications* on its internal type system you're creating an HTMLElement with a tag name of &quot;my-custom-element&quot;.
What you'll likely want to do is cast the result of the createElement function (HTMLElement) as MyCustomElement:
/** @type {MyCustomElement} */
const myCustomElement = /** @type {MyCustomElement} */ (document.createElement('my-custom-element'));

You can't directly run Linux shell scripts on Windows. You do have a few options, however:


Run your script through Cygwin
Run your script in mintty (this is the shell included with Git for Windows, is called Git Bash in the context menu)
Run your script under WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Port the script to another language you can run on Windows




For 1 and 2, it'll be on you to make sure any dependencies for the script are available in either Cygwin or mintty.

For 3, after making sure WSL is set up you can run a single command under WSL: wsl script.sh arg1 arg2 argX.

I would recommend option 3 or 4. 3 may offer the best experience in terms of compatibility and ease of set up (without porting the script) as Cygwin and mintty can be a pain to set up dependencies in. Option 4 would be best though as long as you are well-versed in both PowerShell and shell scripts and can transpose the equivalent calls from one to the other.
