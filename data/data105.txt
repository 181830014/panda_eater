Title: Class view in Visual studio
Description: 
    
    
                    
I see that I would benefit from using the class view in visual studio. 
It would give me better overview over my classes, their methods and make it easier for me to see where and when to refactor my class. I assume that it would give me a better structure and enhance the readability of my code.

But....

I find it to awkward to use. I tried to get use it instead of solution explorer, It basically stranded before beginning. I find no similar functionality like "Track Active item in solution explorer".

Any idea on getting started on using the class view or that I just should forget it and stick to solution explorer and stay ignorant? ;)

Some years ago some people were sure that writing code will no longer exists and everything is going to be UML modeling, so I guess they were wrong.. its great power is initial model(as it name tells). Personally I found it slow clicking with the mouse and prefer writing my classes with coding.. 

The most important thing is to be productive. My advice is to try it (it helps in design), but if you don't feel comfortable with it, don't worry, a lof of good programmers don't know that it even exists :) 
    
    
Title: Glassfish IDE integration
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am an Eclipse user.
I am going to be using Glassfish on a project.
Is the Glassfish IDE integration substantially better in NetBeans (or some other), or is the integration the same as Eclipse?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
with the full set of JavaEE plugins in Eclipse, it's trivial to control/deploy to glassfish. Grab the JavaEE version of Eclipse and follow the wizard for creating a new enterprise application.

Generally speaking, unless you're debugging the only intergration you really need is: start, stop, deploy. You can make almost any IDE/script/buildfile do that. Stick with the IDE you're most productive in.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I can't compare it to eclipse because I never tried it in eclipse but I can cast my vote for Netbeans integration. I've been using it for a while with Netbeans and I am very satisfied with the result.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I stuck with Eclipse.

Glassfish IDE integration is better with NetBeans.  

The plugin for Eclipse isn't quite ready for primetime.
https://glassfishplugins.dev.java.net/eclipse34/

My personal experience is that Eclipse with the Java EE extensions are more than sufficient for development, and deployment of JAX-WS apps are faster in Eclipse than with Netbeans.

The Glassfish plugin has forms for editing configuration for things as nuanced as WSIT WS-Security and WS-AtomicTransaction.  This speeds configuration.  However, I've found that deploying a JAX-WS app performs ws-import more times than necessary, which doubles deployment time.
    
    
Title: How do I make intellisense work for referenced projects within a solution in Visual Studio 2008?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a C# solution consisting of 12 projects.  One project (called myControls) is where I'm creating custom Silverlight controls.  I consume some of the controls under myControls in another project called (Viewer).  I have verified that my namespaces and class names are correct under both projects.

But then I try to reference two brand new controls in Viewer from myControls, Intellisense doesn't seem to recognize my brand new controls although it sees the other ones.  I have verified that my namespaces are correct in Viewer, I have verified that my references to myControls resides in the References folder.  Is there anything else I need to be aware of?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If it's a brand new project or new controls it doesn't always build references--for me at least--until the project has been built for the first time and compiles. Also, if they have a backing class, make sure that your namespaces between the linked classes for your control are correct.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Check the access Modifier of the control class: public, private, internal, etc. Select the one that you think will fit better, use public for instance.

Best Regards!
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
What type of project is this?  WinForms or WebForms?
But you should see your controls in the toolbox as well.

Also, why so many projects?  One side effect of this approach is that your build will be much slower.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Try to right click on the project with the controls and select Rebuild. 
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Your objects are probably private, or they don't have a public default constructor.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am trying to add a remote server to "server explorer" (not a data connection) so I can view Event Logs, Services etc.  I keep getting the following error:

"Could not reconnect to 'mail'. Make sure the machine name and path are valid."

'mail.domain.com' is what the IP address I enter resolves to (this is due to the email server being on this remote computer).

What needs to be running on the remote server to allow VS to access this functionality, which port do I need to ensure is open?

Could you clarify the word remote, i.e. is this machine in your Network or are you connecting elsewhere.

Also when it says that it could not "reconnect" does that mean you have managed to connect in the first attempt and them some action has caused this error message?

My initial guess is that you do not have permission to the machine that you are trying to access, what permissions do you have on this machine?

Title: Is there a way to collapse functions and sub-routines for Classic ASP in Visual Studio 2008?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a way to enabling collapsing of functions and sub-routines for Classic ASP in Visual Studio 2008?  I'm able to manually go through and specify blocks of code as collapsable, but it would save me a lot of time if there was a way to automatically do this.

Otherwise, is there another IDE or text editor that you can think of that supports this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Notepad++ has a "Function List" plugin:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=189927&amp;package_id=223668

While this doesn't allow you to collapse your Classic ASP functions and sub-routines, it lists them in a side panel and you can click them to jump from function to function.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Notepad++ allows you to collapse code. I'm not sure if it collapses on function level, but it sure allows you to collapse whole code blocks and HTML blocks (e.g. you can collapse the "head" or a "div" block, etc).

@coxymla: are you sure mate? I just opened up a HTML page in Notepad++ and I can collapse for example the HEAD without any problems. Maybe I did not explain it clear enough in the above text, but that's because English is not my main language.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I haven't been able to find a good solution for this, unfortunately.

When you open an ASP document, Notepad++ allows you to collapse functions and script blocks, but not HTML elements, even if you set the Language to HTML! (When you open a .htm file in Notepad++, it does allow you to collapse those elements though.)
The VS 2008 text editor is the other way around - HTML elements are fair game but not ASP code itself.

Edited for clarity.

Primalscript does this.  It's mostly very nifty, except it's tending towards bloat which is frustrating.  It's also pricey, but the speed it adds to development probably justifies the cost over time.

Title: How to indicate public/protected/private members in JSDT outline view?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Javascript Developer Tools (JSDT) for Eclipse provides a nice outline view of Javascript classes, with a little symbol next to them to indicate visibility. 

Looking at Preferences-
Answer 1: 

    
    
Seems that it is just a standard Java-based settings tree (used in many plugins) but without real implementation of JS private members stuff. Oh, we can hope that it is reserved for future use :)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There's no syntactical way of making a method private, public or protected in JavaScript, it strictly relies on where the method is defined (scope).

Marking a methods privacy is something else, there really isn't a standard for that. All I've ever heard of is the "underscore" for private members. So maybe JSDT doesn't implement this.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I believe there is a @private annotation supported by JSDoc. Not sure how standard it is, or whether JSDT supports/enforces it.

Since JSDT is a reimplementation of the JDT interfaces, it may just be reusing JDT's private/protected/public model best it can, without an actual way to mark fields/methods for access control.

Title: Is there an alternative to Chrome Developer Tools for Chromebooks that have it disabled?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I run an after-school coding club for kids who are learning to build their own projects using HTML, CSS, and Javasccript. We are using a browser-based IDE called theia.
A large number of those kids are using school-issued Chromebooks, which unfortunately have developer tools disabled. This is enforced at the district level and is not something they are willing to change (apparently it allows students to cheat on certain testing sites). Being on Chromebooks means students also cannot launch Chrome with --remote-debugging-port.
I'm looking for potential alternatives that will allow students to do any of the following:

Inspect element to see:

underlying DOM element
applied CSS rules
box model properties


View javascript console error messages and stack trace
Interact with the console as a REPL (with access to window scope)
Debug scripts with step-in, step-out, step-over, etc.

I have full control over the IDE and can build extensions on top of it, so I'm hoping to find something I can integrate.
I found a cool proof-of-concept javascript step debugger, but it's not actively developed, and is only intended for use with small example scripts. It works by compiling the js code into something that can be controlled with a state machine. Does anyone know of anything else that's similar?
I'm also wondering if there's a possible way to plug into a headless instance of chrome running on the IDE server (which is running in a docker container), but I'm not sure what that would involve.

Thus, is there a way to either enable the setting so that will be used by default, or is there a way to disable any shortcut key linked to auto format using some sort of maven plugin?  Basically I am looking for a way to enforce this for anyone who is working on the codebase since everyone can change their own formatter settings.
