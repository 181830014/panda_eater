I am new to android studio IDE development. Every time when I imported a sample project that developed in the android studio, I am getting this error..


  No cached version of com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.1.0 available
  for offline mode. Disable Gradle 'offline mode' and sync project.


How can I solve this problem.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
On Windows:-
Go to File -&gt; Settings.
And open the 'Build,Execution,Deployment'.  Then open the
Build Tools -&gt; Gradle
Then uncheck   -&gt; Offline work on the right.
Click the OK button.
Then Rebuild the Project.
On Mac OS:-
go to Android Studio -&gt; Preferences, and the rest is the same.
OR follow steps given in the image

Answer 2: 

    
    
Gradle is in offline mode, which means that it won't go to the network to resolve dependencies.

Go to Preferences /p/div
Answer 3: 

    
    
Edit. As noted in the comments, this is no longer working with the latest Android Studio releases. 

The latest Android studio seems to only reference to "Offline mode" via the keymap, but toggling this does not seem to change anything anymore. 



In Android Studio open the settings and search for offline it will find the Gradle category which contains Offline work. You can disable it there.


    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
@mikepenz has the right one.

You could just hit SHIFT+COMMAND+A (if you're using OSX and 1.4 android studio) and enter OFFLINE in the search box.

Then you'll see what mike have shown you.

Just deselect offline.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Offline mode could be set in Android Studio and in your project.
To verify that gradle won't build your project in offline mode:


Disable gradle offline mode in Android Studio gradle settings.
Verify that your project's gradle.settings won't contain: startParameter.offline=true

    
    
Title: Multiline Find &amp; Replace in Visual Studio
Description: 
    
    
                    
Can it be done? We're using VS2005 and VS2008 and VS2010.

I don't mean regular expressions - which have their place - but plain old text find &amp; replace. I know we can do it (at a pinch) with regular expressions using the \n tag but prefer not to get tangled up in regex escape characters, plus there's a readability issue.

If it can't be done what plain and simple (free) alternative are people using? That doesn't involve knocking up our own macro.

This works today in Visual Studio 2012:

fooPatternToStart.*(.*\n)+?.*barPatternToEnd


See how the (.*\n)+? part does the match across multiple lines, non-greedy.
fooPatternToStart is some regex pattern on your start line, while barPatternToEnd is your pattern to find on another line below, possibly many lines below...

Example found here.

Simple and effective :)

Note: before VS2012, the pattern that worked was: fooPatternToStart.(.\n)+@.*barPatternToEnd

Regarding the comment of Andrew Corkery Aug 19 '11 at 9:52 above:
If you like to specify a multi-line replacement string as well, edit the macro code and set the replacement text as shown below.
This will allow you to "fine-tune" your replacement with just the small modifications needed.

 Sub FindLine()
    Dim textSelection As TextSelection

    textSelection = DTE.ActiveDocument.Selection
    textSelection.CharLeft(True)
    DTE.ExecuteCommand("Edit.Find")
    DTE.Find.FindWhat = textSelection.Text

    'also preset replacement text with current selection
    DTE.Find.ReplaceWith = textSelection.Text
End Sub

    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
The latest version (as of this posting) of Notepad++ does multi-line find/replace. I don't know if this was true back when this was asked. But with no macro support in Visual Studio anymore, this is relevant now.

Make some changes in Eclipse
Forget to press save

Title: How to return void in JsDoc?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a specified way to declare a method or a function to return void in JsDoc? Currently I am in the belief that void is the default return value, and other return values must be specifically provided:

/**
 * @return {Integer} The identifier for ...
 */

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't believe you have to choose from a set of types in JsDoc... you can use any type name you wish (the curly braces indicate it's a type), so you can simply do:

@return {Void}


Although, this is probably more correct for JavaScript:

@return {undefined}

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Closure Compiler
According to the documentation of Google's Closure Compiler if nothing is being returned, the @return annotation should be omitted.

If there is no return value, do not use a @return tag.

Source: https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler#tags
jsdoc-toolkit
However further documentation also states that the returnType and returnDescription are optional parameters.

returnType - Optional: the type of the return value.
returnDescription - Optional: any additional description.

Source: https://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/wiki/TagReturns
Summary
You could either leave out the return annotation or include it without any parameters.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Looking at the ESlint docs they use
@returns {void}

Source: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/valid-jsdoc

Since I need to provide an @returns for each function to pass tests in order to push code for certain projects this is required in my case. 
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
If you need to say out loud that nothing is returned, you can say that in the free-form description. This is useful to clarify situations where a user might expect something to be returned. Of course proper naming of the function and the parameters should alone make the expected return type apparent, but it might not always be possible.

/**
 * This is a funny function. Returns nothing.
 * @param {string} a joke.
 */
var funny = function (joke) {
  console.log(joke);

Title: QtCreator: No valid kits found
Description: 
    
    
                    
Installed just the IDE on Windows 7.  I want to create a Plain C++ Project (Non-QT Project); however I get an error: No valid kits found.  When I click on Options-em/em/pp/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
Though OP is asking about Windows, this error also occurs on Ubuntu Linux and Google lists this result first when you search for the error"QtCreator: No valid kits found".  

On Ubuntu this is solved by running:

For Qt5:

sudo apt-get install qt5-default


For Qt4:

sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev libqt4-core libqt4-gui

Answer 2: 

    
    
Found the issue.  Qt Creator wants you to use a compiler listed under one of their Qt libraries. Use the Maintenance Tool to install this.

To do so:


  Go to Tools -
Answer 3: 

    
    
No valid Kits found. 
The problem occur because qt-creator don't know the versions of your qt, 
your compiler, or your debugger. 
For this let's solve the Qt versions. It may normally solve the other ;).

You try to create a new project, run select a kit and then there is no kit available in the list. 

Follow the steps:


execute in your terminal the command: sudo apt-get install qt5-default 
to install qt version 5. 
Verify the version of your Qt and the location of your qmake file. Do this by executing in your terminal the command qmake --version.
You may have a result similar to this line. 
QMake version 3.1
Using Qt version 5.9.5 in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu. What's important here is the location /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu.
Open your Qt-creator. 
Go to "Tools
Answer 4: 

    
    
In my case the issue was that my default kit's Qt version was None.

Go to Tools -&gt; Options... -&gt; Build &amp; Run -&gt; Kits tab, click on the kit you want to make as default and you'll see a list of fields beneath, one of which is Qt version. If it's None, change it to one of the versions available to you in the Qt versions tab which is just next to the Kits tab.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
For QT 5.* if you face error at Kits, like No Valid Kits Found, go to Options-
Answer 6: 

    
    
I had a similar problems after installing Qt in Windows.
This could be because only the Qt creator was installed and not any of the Qt libraries during initial installation. When installing from scratch use the online installer and select the following to install:

For starting, select at least one version of Qt libs (ex Qt 5.15.1) and the c++ compiler of choice (ex MinGW 8.1.0 64-bit).

Select Developer and Designer Tools. I kept the selected defaults.


Note: The choice of the Qt libs and Tools can also be changed post initial installation using MaintenanceTool.exe under Qt installation dir C:\Qt. See here.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Another way to solve this issue (I did it on Ubuntu 16.04 but it might also work for windows and other Ubuntu versions):

While going through the installation steps, when you reach the step where you choose which packages to install via check boxes, instead of just pressing next with the default "Tools" checkbox selected also check the box for the version of QT you would like in addition to the "Tools" box. I usually check the first box which is the latest version of QT.

After doing this you should not see the "no valid kits found" issue described in this thread.

Happy Coding.
    
    
Title: ropemacs USAGE tutorial
Description: 
    
    
                    
There are many sites with instructions on installing ropemacs, but so far I couldn't find any with instructions on how to use it after it's already installed. I have it installed, or at least it seems so, Emacs has "Rope" menu in it's top menu bar. Now what? So far I could use only "Show documentation" (C-c d by default). An attempt to use code assist (which is auto-complete, I presume?) only causes Emacs to ask about "Rope project root folder" (what's that?) in the minibuffer and then showing nothing.

So, once ropemacs is installed, what are the steps to see it in action on some simple python scripts? Something like "if you have this script in your emacs and put the blinking square here and press this, it does that" would be an answer.

(I've been thinking if I should ask this or not for some time, because nobody else seems to have the same problem)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Well, you first need to select your project root folder. Quite simply, this is the folder at the top level of your project, or the current folder if you're dealing with a single file. Once you've selected the root folder, then other options will work, such as code assist, showing documentation, jumping to other symbols, etc.

For full benefit of ropemacs, I suggest getting autocomplete.el, putting it in ~/.emacs.d, and then adding this to your .emacs

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/auto-complete-1.2")
(autoload 'python-mode "python-mode" "Python Mode." t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.py\\'" . python-mode))
(add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '("python" . python-mode))
(require 'python-mode)
(autoload 'pymacs-apply "pymacs")
(autoload 'pymacs-call "pymacs")
(autoload 'pymacs-eval "pymacs" nil t)
(autoload 'pymacs-exec "pymacs" nil t)
(autoload 'pymacs-load "pymacs" nil t)
(pymacs-load "ropemacs" "rope-")
(setq ropemacs-enable-autoimport t)

(require 'auto-complete)
(global-auto-complete-mode t)


This assumes you install autocomplete in ~/.emacs.d/auto-complete-1.2. After you do this, you will get autocomplete automatically after typing a few characters of a word or symbol.

You can modify your ROOT/.ropeproject/config.py file to add more directories to the rope lookup path, in order to provide better autocomplete.

EDIT: Two of the most important functions for me are looking up documentation and jumping directly to a function definition. This is dependent on setting the rope lookup path correctly for your project as mentioned above.

Documentation: Put the cursor over a symbol (function name, class name, etc), and do:

C-c d


This will show you the docstring for the symbol in question.

Jumping to definition:Put the cursor over a symbol (function name, class name, etc), and do:

C-c g


This will immediately open the file where the symbol resides and jump to the beginning of the definition. This is great for times when the documentation is sparse and you want to see the actual code. Also, it's really nice for navigating around inside your own code.

Find occurrences:

C-c f


Smart search in your entire project for the symbol at the cursor.

Code assist:

M-/


Just type the first characters of a function, class, etc, and this will show a list of possible completions. Note that due to python's nature, it will not always be a complete list.

Refactorings:
There are quite a few options under Rope-/ppstrong/strong/pprecode/code/prepcode/code/p/div
Answer 2: 

    
    
The best usage information I've found is a readme in the ropemacs source, here:

https://github.com/python-rope/ropemacs
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You can set the root folder with rope-open-project . Once you've set the root project a .ropeproject dir will be created. 

Inside it, a config.py file has hooks where you can run (python) code once the project is set. The project_opened(project): function is a good place to run code. I usually activate the virtual environment imp.load_source('/path-to-env/activate_this.py') , so that I can get source coverage for other libs in the virtual env.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
For general usage of the rope library that ropemacs depends on, then check out:


  Rope Overview


It describes in some detail what each of the refactorings does such as extract method.  Note that according to the author this doc is a bit outdated. However, it should provide enough of an intro to ropes' features to get started.

To execute the ropemacs commands in Emacs, you can try one or more of the following:


Use the 'Keybinding' section in the
README docs link from
freyley's answer as a guide to learn the
the mappings. 
If you can't remember the keybindings, then execute M-x rope-&lt;specific command name&gt; and fill in the
related refactoring name. For
example, extract method   would be
M-x rope-extract-method.
Select in Emacs &lt;menu-bar&gt; -&gt; Rope.  For example, for extract method then select &lt;menu-bar&gt; -&gt; Rope -&gt; Refactorings -&gt; Extract Method.  It will also show you the associated keybindings (e.g. C-c r m)

By default they're bound to Ctrl + Numpad_Minus and Ctrl + Numpad_Plus, but you can rebind them. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
To expand on petrilli's answer:


Ctrl + Numpad_Multiply can also be used to expand all
Ctrl + Shift + Numpad_Divide is bound to collapse all
Ctrl + Numpad_Divide toggles folding on and off


And yes, they can all be rebound, if you know what text to filter on in Windows | Preferences | General | Keys.

"Folding", "Expand", "Collapse" are keywords that should get you all of the relevant commands.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If you are using eclipse-pydev then the default keybinds are 

ctrl + 9 : collapse all one level

ctrl + 0 : expand all one level

ctrl + -_ : collapse current location

ctrl + =+ : expand current

Most of the time after the installation of Eclipse eclipse.ini is changed.
If you change the jdk in eclipse.ini then eclipse will use this jdk by default.

Let's say you install a new version of Eclipse and you have forgotten to change the eclipse.ini related to the jdk. Then Eclipse finds a jdk for you.
Let's say it is java 1.6 that was automatically discovered (you did nothing).

If you use maven (M2E) and you reference a 1.7 jdk then you will see the frustrating message.
But normally it is not displayed because you configure the correct jdk in eclipse.ini.

That was my case. I made reference into the pom to a jdk that was not configured into Eclipse.

In the screenshot you can see that 1.7 is configured and seen by Eclipse. In this case, you should make reference into the pom to a jre that is compatible with 1.7!

Description: 
    
    
                    
I've watched an already well known video where Bret Victor, former Apple UI designer shows amazing demos with immediate updates of running code after changing literally one symbol in source code. 

To make my question clear to those who haven't seen or don't have time to watch the video: I want to use a tool like that to write my own software. Is the tool he was demonstrating available, or are there other similar tools? 

It doesn't matter which languages/environments, I just want to have my code running and then change a line in source and immediately see the results updated without restarting it.

The video is also available on YouTube, and the key points are:


03:30 - 05:30 - Live coding a graphical algorithm (space)
11:00 - 14:30 - Live coding some game code (space &amp; time)
17:30 - 21:30 - Live coding local variables (state)

Who does it

You will find a lot interesting things in the React and ELM communities, and in frontend functional programming communities in general.

Some recent full-stack platforms that are somehow trying to provide a development environment of this kind are:

Eve:

A Andreessen Horowitz / Y-Combinator startup, 2.3 million funded, from Chris Granger, an influent Clojure programmer who already built LightTables. 

Technologies: Rust (backend), TypeScript (frontend) with a home-made implementation of React concepts (what they call "microReact")

Unison:

Not a company (yet?) but supported by a Patreon campaign, from Paul Chiusano (author of famous book "FP in Scala"). 

Technologies:  Haskell (backend), ELM (frontend).



Note: you can see that the guys behind these tools are experienced functional programmers. Check "how it works" section.

It also displays the state of local variables next to each assignment. Here's an example display of a binary search algorithm:

def search(n, a):              | n = 3 a = [1, 2, 4] 
    low = 0                    | low = 0 
    high = len(a) - 1          | high = 2 
    while low &lt;= high:         |         | 
        mid = (low + high) / 2 | mid = 1 | mid = 2 
        v = a[mid]             | v = 2   | v = 4 
        if n == v:             |         |

I also just discovered Live Code. After some experimentation I found, it does not encompass all the principles of Bret Victor philosophy. It has a straight forward syntax but the UI doesn't make for interactive development. They still have some way to go.

There's COLT — a live coding tool for Flash (ActionScript3). It allows methods updates, adding new fields/methods/classes, updating embedded assets, etc at runtime while preserving the application state, just like in Bret Victor's video. There are some demo videos of it in action, with this being the most impressive one so far.

It doesn't force you into any new IDE, it's a separate tool which sends the incremental updates to the running app when you hit 'save' in your IDE.

Title: Enabling tabs in xcode? Or lessening the pain of not having them?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am currently using xcode and I find it's lack of tabs quite disturbing.

I currently use command-shift-d to search through all the files, or ctrl-1 to open the history of files that were recently opened.

It works but I find it less effective than just tabbing through the few files i am currently working on.

Is there any way, third party or not, to enable some sort of tabbed organization?
If not, is there any other way to quickly navigate through a subset of files?

Answer 4: 

    
    
The Xcode source code editor allows you to choose the file from a list. It's two clicks instead of one (as it would be with tabbing), but it's better than nothing.

In addition, you can simply Alt-Tab through your open source code windows. This is not slower than tabbing, and has the same effect since the source code windows are usually placed exactly one in front of another.

        key code 125 -- choose "Recent Files" ("keystroke down" doesn't work)
        keystroke return -- enter to "Recent Files"
        key code 125 -- choose previous file
    end tell
end tell


And bind it to some shortcut using for example FastScripts(free up to 10 bindings)

I have this script on "Control" + "`". (XCode 4)

There are some features in an IDE that are so transformative that you don't know how you lived without them.  Integrated help was one.  IntelliSense-like functionality was another.  VS 6.0's Debug and Continue was absolutely killer.  Visual Studio kicked butt for quite a while.  Not bad, given the awful NeXTstep rip-off it all started as.  (Or is it that memories of NeXTstep has faded until VS seems okay?)

Sure, there are much better EDITORS that VS, but as a complete package for Win32 development nothing seems to come close.

There are free Express editions now, but they seem pretty crippled.

I am quite enjoying Eclipse under Linux (and derivatives of it on Windows used in some FPGA vendor toolchains).  I -really- don't like the lack of integrated MSDN-style help, though.

Answer 17: 

    
    
I will quote myself from this question:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/780837/what-is-a-good-linux-ide-for-code-completion/917854#917854


  Someone already said this before me,
  but QtCreator is really good for Qt4
  development.
  
  Not only it has a really good code
  completion support. It also knows a
  little more about the code and what to
  complete then I thought I needed. For
  example it knows about slots/signals.
  This means that connecting
  slots/signals via code is much easier
  then before.
  
  The code editing is really nice. I
  remember that when refactoring code,
  (a few variables starting with
  underscore) it remembered the cursor
  position between lines and this made
  the refactoring much easier. The code
  indentation is smart enough to not get
  in my way (KDevelop was configurable,
  but QtCreator learns how I code. At
  least it feels like it does).
  
  Then there are the cool key
  combinations. Most of the
  functionality of the IDE can be
  accessed using shortcuts. The
  "control+k" thingie is a nice thing,
  which some command line users would
  like, but I am more GUI oriented. I
  don't use it.
  
  What I really like, is the split
  window command. Yes, KDevelop3 does
  it, but not as nice as QtCreator. My
  favorite is control+e,3 which I use to
  display the header and implementations
  of my classes. Once again, the
  navigation here is the best I have
  seen (control+e,o).
  
  It also has a nice SCM integration. I
  usually use SVN, and quite frankly
  it's not as good as I need: no
  shortcut to diff the project, no diff
  to commit the whole project, no option
  to commit several files.
  
  I also don't like the "total
  integration of external tools". I
  still like the external QtAssistant -
  control+tab is easier to read large
  articles. But.... when you define a
  QString s, and 3 lines bellow you want
  to read the interface of QString, you
  put your cursor on "s" and press F1 -
  the assistant comes as a sidebar with
  QString's documentation. A huge
  advantage.
  
  Want to follow a definition? F2 to the
  help. F4? Changes
  header/implementation (yes, eclipse
  does this better...).
  
  The debugger is good. It's not as good
  as VisualStudio but ... it has support
  for Qt4 internals (you can see the
  value of QString and QList!).
  
  I can continue... but IMHO you will
  need to give it a second and third
  try. It really is a good product. Not
  as flexible as Eclipse (hi
  ryansstack), but it's a really small,
  fast and young project. I stopped
  developing QDevelop because I really
  found what I was looking for.
  
  ps: yes, I mean stopped developing
  QDevelop. I was in the development
  team.


My response is for Qt4 development only. Be warned.

Visual studio is great, but there are few tricks you can enhance it with. SonicFileFinder is one - helps you to search source files by partial match. You can map solution-tree to Alt+1, partial filename search to alt+2, and properties-window to alt+3. These are the three most used windows. 

Another great tool that is ofter misunderstood is ctrl+shift+F shortcut for searching file contents. People dont use because it's so slow, but my advice is - deal with it. Searching  the whole solution (or even all files in project folder) is only slow the first time you use it. Consequitive searches are as fast as jump-to-definition-feature.

I've tried SlickEdit, Notepad++, emacs, jEdit and Visual Studio. VS wins hands-down for Best Windows IDE. 

jEdit is probably the best GUI cross-platform editor/almost-IDE, and emacs is probably the best terminal cross-platform editor/almost-IDE. The advantage with using these is that when you jump to a Mac or Linux box, you know how they work.

With Intellisense, code folding, edit and continue, and a whole host of other features, Visual Studio is certainly the best IDE.  However, for simple code editing, I often use UltraEdit.

Here's another vote for Visual Studio.  The debugger and Intellisense are definitely it's hallmarks.  While other IDE's offer code-completion, I've often found them to be somewhat sluggish in this area for some reason (sluggish being a reference to the speed at which code-completion occurs and offers selections).

The question says specifically IDE so I am guessing thats what you want. In that case, the main options are Visual Studio and Eclipse CDT as stated above. Of those, I personally prefer Eclipse. However, don't necessarily limit yourself to an IDE. I prefer to use vim as my editor and WinDbg as my debugger. For compilation, your project will probably dictate this. I currently use NMAke on the command line.

I can't seem to find a way to change the code font size in WebStorm. I change the font size in options and it changes the menu and toolbar font size but not the actual code. Any ideas?

Title: Error when calling 3rd party executable from Powershell when using an IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a PowerShell script that uses du.exe (Disk Usage originally from Sysinternals) to calculate the size of directories.

If I run du c:\Backup in the console, it works as expected, but the same line of code run in ISE or PowerGui gives the expected result plus the error 

+ du &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  c:\backup
+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:String) [], RemoteException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError


Why is that? How do I avoid this error? I tried invoke-expression, using &amp;, but no go.

Thanks for the help.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
To avoid this you can redirect stderr to null e.g.:

du 2&gt; $null


Essentially the console host and ISE (as well as remoting) treat the stderr stream differently.  On the console host it was important for PowerShell to support applications like edit.com to work along with other applications that write colored output and errors to the screen.  If the I/O stream is not redirected on console host, PowerShell gives the native EXE a console handle to write to directly.  This bypasses PowerShell so PowerShell can't see that there are errors written so it can't report the error via $error or by writing to PowerShell's stderr stream.

ISE and remoting don't need to support this scenario so they do see the errors on stderr and subsequently write the error and update $error.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I've recently been facing the same issues, but I would like to get the stderr output directed to stdout. You would think that the following would work:
    &amp; du 2&gt;&amp;1

But PowerShell will interpret the redirection and process it after 'du' is completed. The work-around I found is to invoke it using cmd.exe /c:
    &amp; cmd /c 'du 2&gt;&amp;1'

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Another way to suppress the NativeCommandError output is to convert the objects in the pipeline to strings as outlined at the bottom of this answer:

du c:\Backup 2&gt;&amp;1 | %{ "$_" }

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Previous FIX will redirect errors but you could lose a real error if by example your user name or password is not good or if using integrated authentication, you do not have access.

So here is a way to implement the error handling and bypass the specific error (that is not one) raised by psexec.



try {
    whoami # powershell commands
}
catch [System.Management.Automation.RemoteException] {
    if ($_.TargetObject -like "Connecting to *" -and $_.CategoryInfo.Category -eq "NotSpecified" -and $_.FullyQualifiedErrorId -eq "NativeCommandError" -and $_.InvocationInfo.MyCommand.Name -like "psexec*.exe") {

Title: Python and Intellisense
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there an equivalent to 'intellisense' for Python?

Perhaps i shouldn't admit it but I find having intellisense really speeds up the 'discovery phase' of learning a new language.  For instance switching from VB.net to C# was a breeze due to snippets and intellisense helping me along.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This blog entry explains setting Vim up as a Python IDE, he covers Intellisense-like functionality:


(source: dispatched.ch)  

This is standard in Vim 7. There are a number of other very useful plugins for python development in Vim, such as Pyflakes which checks code on the fly and Python_fn.vim which provides functionality for manipulating python indentation &amp; code blocks.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Have a look at python tools for visual studio, they provide code completion (a.k.a  intellisense), debugging etc ...

Below is a screenshot of the interactive shell for python showing code completion.


    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The PyDev environment for Eclipse has intellisense-like functionality for Python. Keeping an interactive console open, along with the help(item) function is very helpful.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
The dynamic nature of the language tends to make autocomplete type analysis difficult, so the quality of the various completion facilities menitoned above varies wildly.

While it's not exactly what you asked for, the ipython shell is very good for exploratory work. When I'm working with a new module, I tend to pull it into ipython and poke at it. Having tried most of the solutions mentioned above (though it's been years since Wing), ipython's completion facilities are consistently more reliable. The two main tools for exploration are tab complete and appending a question mark to the module/function name to get the help text, e.g.:

In [1]: import sqlalchemy

In [2]: sqlalchemy.s #tab completion
sqlalchemy.schema    sqlalchemy.select    sqlalchemy.sql       sqlalchemy.subquery

In [2]: sqlalchemy.select? #Shows docstring

In [3]: sqlalchemy.select?? #Shows method source

In [4]: edit sqlalchemy.select #opens the source in an editor

The IDLE editor that comes with Python has an intellisense feature that auto-discovers imported modules, functions, classes and attributes.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I strongly recommend PyDev. In Pydev you can put the module you are using in the Forced Buildins, mostly the code-completion will work better than in other IDEs like KOMODO EDIT.

Also I think IPython is very helpful. Since it is 'run-time' in IPython, the code-completion in IPython won't miss anything.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
PyCharm is the best Python IDE with IntelliSense support.
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
I'd recommend Komodo Edit.  However, I should point something out:  you're not going to get anything quite as good as what you're used to with Visual Studio's C# intellisense.  Python's dynamic nature can make it difficult to do these kinds of features.
    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
Wingware for example implements auto-completion, see http://wingware.com/doc/edit/auto-completion .
    
    
Answer 10: 

    
    
ctags + vim works ok, too, although it is not as powerful as intellisense. Using this with ipython, you can get online help, automatic name completion, etc... But that's obviously command-line oriented.

Eclipse + pydev can do it as well, but I have no experience with it: http://pydev.sourceforge.net/
    
    
Answer 11: 

    
    
Well, I think the most dynamic way to learn Python is to use iPython.

You got autocompletion when using tab, dynamic behaviour because it's a shell and you can get the full documentation of any object / method typing :

object.method ?


When developping, I agree that PyDev is cool. But it's heavy, so while learning, a text editor + iPython is really nice.

I tried to use the answer from @Andrew Lazarev. However due to a non backward compatible change on GTK3.20 (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=766166) the bindings have to be slightly adapted:

@binding-set MyTreeViewBinding
{
   bind "Left"     { "select-cursor-parent" ()
                  "expand-collapse-cursor-row" (0,0,0) };
   bind "Right"    { "expand-collapse-cursor-row" (0,1,0) };
}

treeview
{
   -gtk-key-bindings: MyTreeViewBinding;
}


Note the - before gtk-key-bindings and the GtkTreeView renamed to treeview.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
The navigation of Tree widget is controlled by underlaying widget toolkit - GTK. SWT/Eclipse has no control over it.

While in debug mode, and between two breakpoints, hit the F9 key.

AFAIK, there is no direct F5 like in Visual Studio to jump to the next breakpoint without cursor pointing. The closest is the ALT+F9 that jumps to the cursor.

For quick reference, the most used debugging keyboard shortcuts are:


F8 Step over 
F7 Step into 
Shift + F7 Smart step into 
Shift + F8 Step out 
Alt + F9 Run to cursor 
Alt + F8 Evaluate expression 
F9 (Mac: Cmd + ALT + R) Resume program 
Ctrl + F8 (Mac: Cmd + F8) Toggle breakpoint 
Ctrl + Shift + F8 (Mac: Cmd + Shift + F8) View breakpoints

2.0RC (aka 1.9.x) you can get it via SVN and compiling. The process is quite straightforward, and you can run it without installing (via make run). It's somewhat less stable than 1.0, but it depends on which build you get (it's a development snapshot). Regarding capabilities, it is great.

Spring produces a stand-alone Eclipse plugin (no dependencies on Spring) called Quick Search

http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/quick-search-eclipse

For efficiency, it searches your open files first. So while it isn't purely restricting to opened files as you requested, you can still get a similar effect in practice by just clicking the first results that come up.

The currently opened files simply aren't considered special in eclipse - you have far more advanced methods of organizing your files: projects and working sets.

Working sets allow you to define sets of files, which can be used as constraints for many operations. You have to define them explicitly, but then they don't change just because you've closed a file.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
There is no find-in-open-files command in Eclipse, no.

I think that the main reason find-in-open-files is not implemented in Eclipse is probably because the set of open files is for many users rather insignificant. (In fact, I don't know (or care) which files I have open. (I even have Eclipse set to automatically close editors/files when they become too many). If I want to navigate to a file, I open it. Limiting a search to the files I currently have open would be completely pointless for me.)
    
    
Title: How to uninstall plugins in Eclipse 3.4.X or higher
Description: 
    
    
                    
The GUI for managing plugins in Eclipse got a bit of an overhaul in version 3.4.0. 
This GUI is accessed via the "Software Updates..." option in the Help menu. 
This displays the following dialog:

alt text http://www.iol.ie/~murtaghd/img/eclipse-2.jpg
Notice that the option to remove the selected plugin (Mylyn) is greyed out. In fact, this is true of virtually every installed plugin. I know that the Mylyn plugins are optional, so why amn't I provided with an option to remove them?

There are distributions of Eclipse that come packaged with certain plugins that can't be mix-and-matched. That is the case with Mylyn, that went from a student's thesis project to an integral part of Eclipse. If you want to actually get rid of Mylyn, you may want to install Eclipse classic instead of the distribution you have, and then install the stuff you need. 

The standard Eclipse distributions come with Myln.

It sure looks like there's no way to do this.

I just had exactly this problem with a fresh download of the Eclipse Java IDE (Ganymede SR2). I didn't want Mylyn, but I didn't want "Eclipse Classic", either, because the download was twice the size, I presume because it includes source.

The apparent solution was to update everything and restart Eclipse, after which the "Uninstall..." button became enabled for the Mylyn plugins. Unfortunately, this only uninstalled the most recent, updated version (3.0.11 IIRC), reverting to the un-uninstallable 3.0.5.

Title: How do I make my PHP IDE understand Dependency Injection Containers?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Current situation: I have dependencies in my project that I solve by using dependency injection. I want to take the next logic step by using a dependency injection container (DIC) to ease the management of my dependencies and to lazy-load classes.

I looked at Bucket, Pimple, and sfServiceContainer, ran some test and really appreciate how DIC’s work. I’d probably go for Pimple because of its simplicity and raw power. If I didn’t have this problem:

Due to the abstraction that DIC’s offer, the IDE I’m using (PHPStorm) no longer understands what’s going on in my code. It doesn’t understand that $container['mailer'] or $sc-/pp/pp/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can define class of the variable 'manually':

/** @var YourClassType $mailer */
$mailer = $container['mailer'];


In PhpStorm (and by standards), use two asterisks and write the data type before the name of the variable.  

You can write the data type without the name of the variable (but not the name without the data type).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
While you can certainly tell your IDE the type of the object pulled out of your container every time you access it, it's better to do it once. Both of the following solutions involve subclassing the container. I just started using Pimple which recommends doing this anyway.

For containers that use instance members accessed with -&gt; or exposed via the magic __get method, you can tell your IDE what type they hold. This is great because it doesn't involve any additional parsing when the code is run--only the IDE is bothered by it.

/**
 * My container. It contains things. Duh.
 *
 * @property MyService $service
 * @property MyDao $dao
 */
class MyContainer extends Container { }


For Pimple and other containers that act as arrays you can create accessor functions for the top-level objects you'll need. While it means more parsing when the container is created, it should be done once and kept in APC. I vastly prefer a method over array access anyway since it places the easy-to-forget array key inside an auto-completed method.

class MyContainer extends Pimple
{
    /**
     * @return MyService
     */
    public function getMyService() {
        return $this['service'];
    }
}


BTW, for type-hinting inline variables with @var in NetBeans you need to use /* with one asterisk. This is not a doc-block comment and doesn't work with /** or //. Also, the name comes before the type.

public function foo() {
    /* @var $service MyService */
    $service = $container['service'];
    ...
}

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
As the IDE's do not exectue the code, they do not know and need some help form you. I know this works for Eclipse and other IDEs as well: Hint the variable's type.

Netbeans / Phpstorm / PDT / ZendStudio Example

/* @var $mailer MailerInterface */
$mailer = $sc-&gt;mailer


Code complete starts to work again on $mailer.

For PDT it's important that:


The comment starts with one * only.
First the variable name, than the hint.


Alternative Comment Variants

As it was subject to a lot of discussion, it can differ between IDEs. However most IDEs support variable hinting for inline code variables in the way above. So depending on the IDE this might be written differently but similar, like here with two asterisks in front: 

/** @var $mailer MailerInterface */


PHPDoc compatibility

PHPDoc parsers can have a problem if you mimic the class var doc-comment for inline code as so:

/** @var MailerInterface $mailer  */


That documentation is normally used for class variables (@var - Document the data type of a class variable). PHPDoc is then missing the definition of the class variable after the comment which involves a burden for QA.

However some IDEs will offer code completition for simple variables as well when written in PHPDoc clas-variable style. I do not know if that has side-effects for the code-completition of the current class then as a new member might get introduced that actually does not exists.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
For those who came here from google.

PHPStorm actually provides a way to solve this kind of problem instead of writing PHPDocs over and over again — creating and setting .phpstorm.meta.php file in a way described here gains smoothly working autocomplete and type inspections.

            this-
Answer 6: 

    
    
I know that the question is about DIC only, but there is a Silex Pimple Dumper service provider which dumps the container to a json file. The same author wrote a plugin for PHPStorm which can read that file and open the autocomplete with the service names and its type (class, string and etc). I'm using those two components and I can say that are good options for auto completion for Silex/Pimple.

Answer 3: 

    
    
There are (at least) two kinds of Moving line up/down in Android Studio: The "intelligent" one and the "dumb" one. Like IngoAlbers said, the dumb one (Shift+Alt+&lt;Arrow&gt;) just moves the line.

Using Ctrl+Shift+&lt;Arrow&gt; instead, makes the functionality more intelligent:


It doesn't leave the current "context":

public static void test() {
    int i = 5;
    Runnable theodor = new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Hi!");
        }
    };
}


Moving the int i = 5;line down one step, brings you this:

public static void test() {
    Runnable theodor = new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Hi!");
        }
    };
    int i = 5;
}

It keeps methods together:

public static void hello() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
}

public static void dinner() {
    System.out.println("Dinner's ready!");
}

public static void sleep() {
    System.out.println("Good night.");
}


Moving the line public static void sleep() { up one step moves the complete sleep() method above dinner():

public static void hello() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
}

public static void sleep() {
    System.out.println("Good night.");
}

public static void dinner() {
    System.out.println("Dinner's ready!");
}

In most cases, it is just annoying. ;-)

You could configure a formatter (Preferences | Java | Code Style) to inject extra empty lines. Otherwise, you might be able to find a font (Preferences | General | Appearance | Colors and Fonts) with a lot of built-in whitespace. On Windows, I like 'consolas'--it's not particularly whitespace-y but it is a nice mono-spaced, readable font.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
you could put overly high characters in some comment somewhere, try "|ÄÁg$ÑĈђךןﭼژçÅẤДАБψ". As soon as Eclipse sees this in a file, it'll increase the line-separation for the whole file to properly display thos characters.

Create your own bitmap font that uses all of the rows at the top of the font.  It does work, and seems to save about up to 4 rows of pixels in a 17 point font.  I did it as follows:


install otf2bdf

go to font folder, presumably in root terminal
Clone your favorite font (presumably a truetype font) using
otf2bdf to the size you want it
install fontforge
edit the font so that it uses all of the rows above the line for the
capital letters

typically there are about 3 lines of pixels that are left blank and
that is why there  is so much space
between rows
should you wish you can also uses some of the rows below the line but I
think these are typically used for
lower case letters like y which drop
below the line (not so important when
programming)

install the font by:

saving it into one of the font folders such as
/usr/local/share/fonts

I deleted the modules.xml file and reopened WebStorm (2016.2.4), and it was resolved. I looked at the new modules.xml and found that its contents were exactly the same as before, but my &lt;projectName&gt;.iml file was bigger.

So it seems to be a corruption in the .iml file, not modules.xml. I assume that deleting modules.xml triggers a rebuild of the .iml file. Not sure if this helps anyone with anything, but thought I would offer the extra insight.

I looked at the system/log/idea.log file and found that this plugin was producing Null exception whenever I open a new folder as a new project and breaks the content root auto detection by the IDE, and after I uninstalled this plugin, all folders show up as it should.

You might have this issue because of a culprit plugin, and disabling those which you have just installed recently just before  this issue occurs, will resolve the issue. Check the log file and search for ERROR.

If it is found to be an important plugin you are actively using which you are not willing to disable, then a temporary fix is to open Settings-&gt;Directories and click Add content root button to add the root folder of your project, click Ok now folders will show up and indexing will begin, and of course you have to do this everytime you open a new folder as new project.

Title: Getting a lightweight installation of Java Eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
Having dealt with yet another stupid eclipse problem, I want to try to get the lightest, most minimal Eclipse installation as possible.

To be clear, I use eclipse for two things:


Editing Java
Debugging Java


Everything else I do through Emacs/Zsh (editing JSP/XML/JS, file management, SVN check-in, etc). I have not found any aspect of working in Eclipse to do these tasks to be efficient or even reliable, so I do not want plug-ins that relate to it.

From the eclipse.org site, this is the lightest install of eclipse that they have, and I don't want any of those things (Bugzilla, Mylyn, CVS xml_ui), and have actually had problems with each of them even though I do not use them.

So what is the minimal build I can get that will:


Ignore SVN metadata
Includes the full-featured editor (intellisense and type-finding)
Includes the full-featured debugger (standard Eclipse/JDK)


Does not have any extra plug-ins, platforms, or "integrations" with other platforms, specifically, I don't want to deal with plug-ins relating to:

Maven, JSP Validation, Javascript editing or validation, CVS or SVN, Mylyn, Spring or Hibernate "natures", app servers like a bundled Tomcat/GlassFish/etc, J2EE tools, or anything of the like.

I do primarily Spring/Hibernate/web-mvc apps, and have never dealt with an Eclipse plug-in that handles any of it gracefully, I can work effectively with my own toolset, but Eclipse extensions do nothing but get in the way.

I have worked with plain eclipse up to Ganymede, MyEclipse (up to 7.5), and the latest version of Spring-SourceTools, and find that they are all saddled with buggy useless plug-ins (though the combination is always different). 

Switching to NetBeans/Intellij is not an option, and my teammates work with SVN-controlled .class/.project files, so it pretty much has to be Eclipse.

Does anyone have any good advice on how I can save a few grey hairs?

The "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" version isn't the smallest one! Look for "Eclipse Classic" - it doesn't contain most of the things you mentioned. It's larger in download size only, because it comes with source code.

See this comparison: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/compare.php

You can download the empty Eclipse platform and then manually install the JDT tools.


Go to the The Eclipse Project Downloads page. 
Choose the bundle you want, probably Latest Release.
On the download page of the chosen bundle:


Download Platform Runtime Binary
Download JDT Runtime Binary

Extract the Platform Runtime Binary archive file and run it (for example, by double clicking on eclipse.exe).
Install the JDT binary:


Click Help &rarr; Install New Software &rarr;  Add... &rarr; Archive. 
Choose the JDT zip file you downloaded.
Uncheck Group Items by category.
Select the Eclipse Java Development Tools.
Click next to install and restart Eclipse when prompted.





JDT from the Eclipse update site

You can also install JDT from the Eclipse update site, instead of downloading the binary.

To do this, do this following:


Skip downloading the JDT Runtime Binary, only download, extract and run the Platform Runtime Binary.
Go to the Install New Software, but instead of Archive chose the Eclipse download site.
Search and install Eclipse Java Development Tools.

A bit late to this party, but I asked myself the same question for a while, and while now I'm back to a more fully-fledged Eclipse installation, I used to to the following to streamline it a bit. Hope it helps.

What I Needed

Functionalities:


Java Support
Java + Java EE (XML) + Debug Perspectives


Pretty much it. There's a lot of other things I like to use in Eclipse, but I needed to keep it down to the skinniest possible because I was in a 3GB environment where I also needed to run other servers in parallel, so I couldn't afford much.

Resulting Perspectives:


Lightweight Java
Lightweight Browser (fairly tweaked for code reviews and code inspection - that one was actually heavier than the others)
Lightweight Debug


What I Did


Install Eclipse Java EE (install classic if not caring about the Java EE/XML bits)
disable hungry views

disable outline (when you need one, just do CTRL+O)
disable call and type hierarchies

disable decorators
disable menu entries (right-
disable toolbar items

even better: hide the toolbar

disable hovers and actions associated with that
disable spell-checking
disable XML validation
disable Mylyn
disable non-needed search forms in CTRL+H dialog (I usually actually only use the "File Search" mode, sometimes the "Java" one)
disable usage reporting
disable unnecessary plugins or features
disables perspectives and plugins loaded automatically on startup
restrict internal limits:

some views have a scope (enclosing class, project, working set, workspace...)
some views and UI elements have boundaries (console/loggers, highlighters, markers...)

tweak the eclipse.ini to:

-clean the workspace (slower, but I tend to prefer to do that)
use G1GC
reduce memory usage (I noticed that I can perfectly live with -xss128k and -xmx384 with G1, for instance. YMMV, of course, as always with JVM tuning.)
use a server VM (and point directly to the VM's DLL)



Also disable views you don't need in the "Debug" and "Code Browsing" perspectives.

Sorry, I had actually saved all of these as a set of 3 lightweight perspectives to re-import everytime on my new project, but I cannot get my hands on them at the moment. If I ever find then, I'll add a link to them here.

Instead of going for a ready package from Eclipse Downloads, from the same page go for the Eclipse Installer. Currently available for Mac, Windows &amp; the beloved Linux. Launch the Installer which should update (or not if you are lucky enough :) ). Select "Eclipse Platform" which is the absolute minimum from this IDE, set your other installation preferences and install. 

After the download/installation process, I'd suggest your head to Help-/p/div
Answer 6: 

    
    
Get as minimal an installation as you can, and then remove whatever is left that you don't want.

Longer answer:

I played around a bit.  Here's how I experimented:


Extract a clean eclipse*.zip to two different directories; call it eclipse and eclipse-bak.  We'll only modify eclipse.
Before starting it the first time, remove some of the features from the features folder.  I got rid of org.eclipse.cvs, org.eclipse.epp.\*, ...mylyn\*, ...wst\*.
Start up Eclipse to a workspace.  Create in that workspace a Java project, debugging configuration, etc.  Stuff that you would want to do and that will complain if we remove the wrong thing.  Open up the Error Log view.
Close Eclipse.  Remove something (or a group of things) from the plugins folder.
Open Eclipse.  Check the error log to see if something you care about couldn't load.  If it did, add those things back from eclipse-bak/plugins.  If not, close Eclipse and return to step 4 for a new set of plugins.


Using this I got my configuration to still be able to edit and debug Java files, but including only these plugins:

com.ibm.icu*
org.apache.*
org.eclipse.compare*
org.eclipse.core*
org.eclipse.debug*
org.eclipse.draw2d*
org.eclipse.ecf*
org.eclipse.epp.package.java*
org.eclipse.equinox*
org.eclipse.help*
org.eclipse.jdt*
org.eclipse.jface*
org.eclipse.ltk*
org.eclipse.osgi*
org.eclipse.platform*
org.eclipse.rcp*
org.eclipse.search*
org.eclipse.team.core
org.eclipse.team.ui
org.eclipse.text
org.eclipse.ui*
org.eclipse.update*
org.hamcrest*
org.sat4j*


Most of that is core stuff, but you might be able to trim it down further.  Notably gone are Mylyn, the usage collector,  EMF, CVS, WST, even JUnit (though I think you should keep JUnit).

I feel you man, when working with Eclipse, the application is constantly trying to help.
Ignoring workspace corruptions, I spend my development time fighting all the "helpful" things Eclipse does.
XML is not that hard to read, but it still confuses the shit out of me when I get the XML designer.
All it does for me is add an extra manual step to click on the source tab.
Every time a new version of eclipse comes out they redesign the front page and the distributions.
At which time a new quest starts for finding a way to debloat Eclipse again.
I have the same experience with extensions to Eclipse by third parties and avoid them if at all possible.
WTP has somewhat usefull stuff, but overall I prefer a basic java eclipse.

It is a good idea start with the Platform Runtime Binary and add JDT.
Manually extracting the JDT runtime doesn't seem to work for me these days, so it it better to use the update client.
You can use the marketplace client, but personally I have always found it rather annoying.
An alternative is to use the director. The director can install JDT without starting the GUI.

Here is a script that downloads eclipse Oxygen 4.7.3a and installs JDT unnattended:

#!/bin/sh

die() {
    echo &gt;&amp;2 "$@"
    exit 1
}

[ "$#" -eq 1 ] || die "exactly 1 argument required [INSTALL_DIR]"
[ -e "$1" ] &amp;&amp; die "*warning* Aborting! location exists, eclipse already installed?"

INSTALL_DIR="$1"
TARBALL=eclipse-platform-4.7.3a-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz

mkdir -p $INSTALL_DIR
if [ ! -f $TARBALL ]
then
    wget http://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/eclipse/eclipse/downloads/drops4/R-4.7.3a-201803300640/$TARBALL
fi
tar -v -xf "$TARBALL" -C "$INSTALL_DIR" --strip 1

echo "\nUsing director to install java development tools, this may take a while..."
$INSTALL_DIR/eclipse -noSplash -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director -repository http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.7 -installIUs org.eclipse.jdt.feature.group


Simply call the script with one argument, the directory you want Eclipse installed.
Running the script gives me an unpacked install of roughly 129MB, which is more than 100MB smaller than the default download (zipped).
That is not to say you would not be able to shrink it further, but it should rid you of most of the crap.
The executable will be cached for future executions of the script, but it will still be slow, since it needs to go online to download JDT.
Unfortunately, I do not know of a way to cache the plugin download in a local folder.
You could of course zip the created installation, but the script is easier to commit to git.

This script will only work for new users as long as the mirror stays up and will need some updates when a new version is released.
But I am sure most developers are savvy enough to update the script if need be.

If you only want to use Eclipse for editing / Debugging Java I would suggest using a plain Text editor. It seems an overkill to install Eclipse and not use most of its features. 

A very popular choice is VIM. Also check out this SO link for tips in using VIM as a Java editor.  You can also debug Java code with a command line debugger as mentioned in this SO link.

Title: How to exclude a folder that is producing warnings/errors in an Eclipse project?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Okay. I'm sick of this problem.  This has to have an easy fix, I'm sure of it!! I hope SO can help me to get rid of this once and for all!


  Question
  
  How do we get Eclipse to stop trying
  to process/compile all files under a
  particular project directory?  The
  goal is for no errors/warnings to
  exist in the problems view if they
  relate to something in this folder or it's subfolders.


Background

We run Eclipse 3.6 and the m2eclipse plugin v0.10.2.20100623 manages our autobuild. For reasons beyond my control, we have the entire BlazeDS distribution in our SVN project directory under src/main/resources/blazeds.  Essentially, this directory contains a vanilla distribution of tomcat running blazeds to which all our configuration and project files are added when we deploy to our server via SCP.

So, when we run deploy, this version of tomcat is copied to the server and our project is placed inside.  Tomcat and our RIA application work and everything is fine.

The problem is, Eclipse tries to compile everything under src/main/resources/blazeds when running AutoBuild and this generates about 300 errors/warnings in our problem view.  So when a real error surfaces, it gets lost among the noise.

The errors stem from code in /blazeds/tomcat/webapps/samples/testdrive-datapush and also the testdrive-httpservice, traderdesktop example webapps. They have dependent source code that's not on the classpath and jars that aren't included in the libraries.

Failed Attempted Solutions

I'm trying to push the proper solution: to remove the samples completely and also to get blazeds out of our version control.  That's not happening anytime soon.

I've followed the SO answer here but it's only a very temporary solution.  I've tried adding exclusions everywhere I can think of and other members of my team have done the same.  I've removed src/main/resources as a source directory (in preferences

Answer 5: 

    
    
Configure your project (Project/Properties/Java Build Path/Source) to have, instead of the top level src folder with exclusions, just a list of the folders you do want to compile.

Assuming Eclipse Helios, step by step:


Turn off autobuild (Project/Build
Automatically).
Start with it empty.
Delete the errors by right clicking
as in the link (just to be sure).
Add genuine source folders 1 by 1
(Project/Properties/Java Build
Path/Source/Add Folder)
Do an explicit build (Project/Build Project).


If that works, you should be able to turn autobuild back on. If it doesn't, something strange is going on. Perhaps the project is not using the standard Java Builder, but something like an Ant Builder (Project/Properties/Builders).

You should then close Intellij, go to Intellij config folder (on Windows it is C:/Users/&lt;your username&gt;/.IntellijIdeaXXXX.X/config) and remove this config folder and restart Intellij.

None of these worked for me as an acceptable solution. So here is what I figured out:


Go to plugins, uninstall Material UI.
Ensure colour scheme is Default/Darcula.
Restart Idea.


At this point most changes were back to default, but some things like colour of current tab, error highlights, modified files etc were still not back to usual. So I followed the advice of deleting config and things returned to normal. But with this option you lose everything, even the installed plugins. And worst thing was, I was using a settings repository to sync settings, few minutes later the colours were back! So I did a diff with older config directory and then a git log revealed that these files are the culprits.

Delete these 4 files from this path: .IntelliJIdea&lt;version&gt;/config/settingsRepository/repository/


colors/_@user_Darcula.icls
colors/_@user_Default.icls
material_custom_theme. xml

Ctrl+- should do the trick which is the standard keyboard shortcut for Navigate Backwards. Or using the navigation buttons in the standard toolbar.

This is explained on MSDN at https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/zainnab/2010/03/01/navigate-backward-and-navigate-forward/

On this MSDN page, you can see the following explanations


  The editor remembers locations when you move in a single command more
  than several lines away from where you are currently working, or if
  you edit in a particular location that is not adjacent to the last
  place you edited.
  
  The goal is to remember interesting locations so that you can recall
  where you have been working without remembering so many locations the
  feature is not useful (such as every character typed, or every line
  entering several new lines of code one right after the other).

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There is a command which does exactly you asking for: View.PopBrowseContext. It always returns you to the very place where you have pressed F12. It doesn't take in account any movements or edits you did after you have pressed F12.

By default in C# layout it is mapped to Ctrl+Chift+8, but you can assign it to any hotkey you want.

BTW, in VS2015 they decided to get rid of this command.

Shop around, find one that you like and start to use it heavily.  They are all very good IDEs, and I'm sure once you use one for a while you'll get comfortable with it.

Have you tried using the Visual Studio keybindings available in Eclipse Ganymede (3.4)?

(You may want to know that "IntelliSense" is a Visual Studio-term, an probably unknown to anyone without Visual Studio-experience. "Autocompletion" is probably a more widely used term.)

If you start typing the name of any class/variable visible in the current scope and hit Ctrl+Space, it'll bring down the autocompletion.

By default, tab is used to move around autocompleted function call arguments.

I'm gonna play devils advocate here and say that forcing you to use this.myString is actually much safer than just myString. myString could be defined locally (in the method) or in the class as a private member. I sometimes think Visual Studio is a bit cavalier about this. In the sample you mention (I saw the video but it was illegible) where is myString scoped? 
    
    
Title: IntelliJ not starting after OS X Yosemite update
Description: 
    
    
                    
I upgraded my OS X to Yosemite and now my IntelliJ IDE is not starting.

Here is the error message:


  To open “IntelliJ IDEA” you need to install the legacy Java SE 6 runtime.

The officially recommended solution is to install/update JDK 1.6 on Mac (if this link doesn't open in Safari, try Firefox).

Modifying Info.plist will break the application digital signature and prevent the patch updates.

We do not recommend modifying Info.plist file to run under JDK 1.7 or 1.8.

Please check this document for the list of known critical issues specific to Java 7 and 8 on Mac that prevent JetBrains from using these Java versions by default.

While Java 6 has known security issues and is EOL, these issues are most likely not exploitable when you are using Java 6 to run IntelliJ IDEA (and other IDEs based on this platform). Java 6 doesn't install browser plugin to run applets and it would be extremely hard (if not impossible) for the remote attacker to exploit it when it's used to run the IDE.

If you can't accept these (probably minimal) risks of running under Java 6, we recommend using the special IDE distribution with bundled Java 8 (still experimental). To obtain this version add -jdk-bundled to the file name. Since IDEA 14.1 the suffix has changed to -custom-jdk-bundled

Example:


http://download.jetbrains.com/idea/ideaIU-14.0.1.dmg (version that requires Java 6)
http://download.jetbrains.com/idea/ideaIU-14.0.1-jdk-bundled.dmg (version with bundled Java 8)


Please note, it's just an example and may link to an outdated version, please use the latest available version from the the downloads page, click Download, cancel the download, copy the direct link from the Thank you for downloading IntelliJ IDEA page and add -jdk-bundled (-custom-jdk-bundled since 14.1) to the file name. Use this version only if running under Java 6 is absolutely not an option for you, be aware of the known issues.

What you need to do is go ahead and edit this file:


  /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA 13.app/Contents/Info.plist


Replacing this:

&lt;key&gt;JVMVersion&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;1.6*&lt;/string&gt;


with this:

&lt;key&gt;JVMVersion&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;1.7*&lt;/string&gt;


Edit: As said by intellij member @crazycoder, the recomended way to total fix this is to install the latest jdk 1.6

I found that installing Java for OS X 2014-001 after upgrading to Yosemite has solved it for me.

Or change asterisk to plus

&lt;key&gt;JVMVersion&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;1.6+&lt;/string&gt;


The drawback is OS X will with each IDEA start ask you for network permission.

But Java 8 still have some bugs, especially on Retina devices and JetBrains still encourages to use Java 6 from Apple. Latest update working with IDEA on Yosemite is available here http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
If you have latest JDK, you could change info.plist to handle this.

edit Info.plist file, in your jdk, for example:

/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_45.jdk/Contents/Info.plist


update JVMCapabilities dictionary to have following values:

          &lt;key&gt;JVMCapabilities&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;array&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;CommandLine&lt;/string&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;JNI&lt;/string&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;BundledApp&lt;/string&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;WebStart&lt;/string&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;Applets&lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/array&gt;


Now, try restarting the app. The application should now make use of the your JDK instead of looking for JDK 6

OSX has its JDKs in the folder /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/.
There can be multiple versions there, for e.g. 1.7 or 1.8.

As indicated by @CrazyCoder, IntelliJ needs a 1.6 version to be present there, which Yosemite kicked out (in favor of a 1.7 if I'm not mistaken).

To install jdk 1.6, you can indeed simply use the dmg from apple as recommended by @CrazyCoder and confirmed by @LanceP.

As a homebrew cask user, I installed via

brew tap caskroom/versions
brew cask install java6


After this, IntelliJ was up and running again.

Got the same problem with MacOS Catalina version 10.15.2 (19C57) after the PyCharm update.

Workaround: I rolled back to the Version 2019.2 - 2019.2.5.
