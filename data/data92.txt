Title: How does Flutter detect that VSCode is installed?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a portable version of vscode on my Windows PC. I have flutter installed as well. flutter doctor does not detect my VS Code. I'm guessing it is because its not installed via an installer. It was just copy pasted into a folder. 

How can I tell flutter where my VSCode is and that it is my preferred editor without installing it (since I do not have admin rights on the PC)? I tried flutter config -h and it only lists the following options 

--[no-]analytics            Enable or disable reporting anonymously tool usage statistics and crash reports.
--clear-ios-signing-cert    Clear the saved development certificate choice used to sign apps for iOS device deployment.
--gradle-dir                The gradle install directory.
--android-sdk               The Android SDK directory.
--android-studio-dir        The Android Studio install directory.

We only look in the default install locations for each platform. You can find the code here:

https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/217b2bdaa18de2bfddf213bc920b1337e77f1be3/packages/flutter_tools/lib/src/vscode/vscode.dart#L87-L154

You're not missing out on anything by not having it found, all Doctor does is lists it if it's found and tells you if you're missing the Dart Code extension.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am new to JetBrains Rider and find it extremely handy for C# developing.
Just in our solution we have a certain type of exception that is thrown frequently.  When I debug I don't want it to break on this type of exception while I do want it to break on all other exceptions thrown.
It can be easily achieved by Visual Studio.

I found a post here Project Rider - Break on Exception 
It told me how to break on a certain type of Exception.  But still no clue how to break on all Exceptions except this certain type.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can add exception breakpoint for all types and then add exception breakpoint for your certain type with unchecked 'Suspend' option

I have some questions about spyder 3.2.4 ide for python:


The "sidebar" (to the right of the main code-window) which marks all lines with warnings, all lines with todo etc with a small colored marker. Can I set these colors? Can I disable which ones to show?
Can I "smart rename" a variable like in other IDEs? I mean not just text replace, but actually make sure i just rename the selected variable (all occurances and nothing but it) and not just text matching a string i type in like i would in "word".
Can I list all occurances of a variable like in other IDEs? Lets say I have a list called "combinedAreas" and want to list all the uses of that variable, preferably also being ablo to click a line and jump to that line.

Answer 1: 

    
    
You can record a macro by using Edit | Macros | Start Macro Recording.

You will have to type that all text manually and use clipboard as you would normally do. When finished recording you can assign custom shortcut to the freshly recorded macro and use it where needed.

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/using-macros-in-the-editor.html



But I do not think that you actually need a macro here.

What you most likely need is code snippets .. which called Live Templates in IDEA-based IDEs -- it can work with clipboard content as well.

Once you create such Live Template .. you just type its' abbreviation in the text, hit the expand key (Tab should be the default one) and it will insert that code snippet instead.

Title: Permanently remove Pivotal tc from STS
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using STS since a long time and the only feature annoys me is, it creates a new Pivotal tc Server instance in every workspace created and I never use Pivotal tc. 

Can anyone tell me how to completely remove Pivotal tc Server from STS installation?

I have tried to update the artifacts.xml file, bundles.info (equinox) and bluntly deleting the features for Pivotal tc but I've never got clean result.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Once you unzipped the distribution it should have a folder with tc-server in it. Simply delete that entire folder and STS will no longer try and create a tc-server install in your workspace.

For example in my installation it looks like this:

$ ls -la sts-bundle/
total 20
drwxrwxr-x  5 kdvolder kdvolder 4096 Oct 12 05:47 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 kdvolder kdvolder 4096 Nov  6 14:43 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 kdvolder kdvolder 4096 Oct 11 04:03 legal
drwxr-xr-x 11 kdvolder kdvolder 4096 Oct 13 07:56 pivotal-tc-server-developer-3.2.8.RELEASE
drwxr-xr-x  9 kdvolder kdvolder 4096 Nov  3 15:41 sts-3.9.1.RELEASE


So simply delete the folder pivotal-tc-server-developer-3.2.8.RELEASE.
    
    
Title: VIM - different colorschemes for different file types
Description: 
    
    
                    
I would like to configure my Vim as an IDE for Python and C/C++. 

I know that .vimrc file has to be expanded, but what are commands to create one colorscheme for .py files and another one for .c files? Files without these extensions should work in "regular" Vim style.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use an autocmd the file type to do this.

" Set 'foo' colorscheme for Python files
autocmd Filetype python colorscheme foo

" Set 'bar' colorscheme for C/C++ files
autocmd Filetype c colorscheme bar
autocmd Filetype cpp colorscheme bar


Caveat: as has been discussed in the comments, color scheme is global in Vim. I believe this is true for console Vim and for GUI Vim. So this is of limited utility unless you tend to only use console Vim and you only edit one file at a time (or one type of file at a time).

That is, if you open a Python file, it will set the color scheme. If you then open a C file in another window (in the same Vim instance), it will set the color scheme again - but this affects everything, including your Python window and any other windows you might have open in Vim.

I know there's android's source code. But how to find an implementation or subclass of some specific interfaces or abstract classes, like FragmentManager? It's annoying and upset when you're digging into source code to find bugs or try to understand how things work but only arrive at interfaces and abstact classes. 

Thanks for share.

Update: OK, I find there's a inner class in FragmentManager that inherits it. But what about others, like context, some services? Maybe google helps sometimes, but what if it can't?

Self conclusion: Official API reference lists public sub-classes. If private or package-private are expected, they are supposed to be in same package or class file.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Just perform a search in android sources using Android Studio search. Particularly in this case you are interested in classes that extend from FragmentManager, which means, that you are searching for "... extends FragmentManager" through the sources:



Check "Directory" radio button and "Recursively" checkbox, pointing out path to sdk in the box.

Then in preview window you'll get prompted with matches:

I am looking for a feature that i will explain below. Please let me know if there are any plugins that allow you to do this in Sublime Text 3 and if this is a normal feature for an IDE.
Lets say you have:

Class A{
    ....
    Foo member_foo;
}

member_foo.Init();


With sublime text when I goto defn on the above line, it will list all the Init() functions in my entire project(there are many). I want it to go to Foo's Init() function obviously. Is there a plugin that will add this functionality in sublime text? Is this normal functionality in C++ IDEs?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Sublime provides some intellisense out of the box,
but as you've noted, it is not actually parsing the C++ and has some shortcomings.   

You can install the Rtags plugin.
I've also used EasyClangComplete.

Another tip that may help you, is to use Ctrl+Shift+r.
This will let you jump to symbols in a project.

I am trying to write the simplest ever snippet for Kdevelop (5.1).

#if 0
my current selection
#endif


Snippet code is:

#if 0 
${view.selection()}

And all I receive back is the error:

#if 0 
ReferenceError: Can't find variable: Range

Is there a way to accomplish what I want?
How to fix this Range error?

Thanks.

EDIT:

I added a function selection_or_nothing() to the functions tab, a require ("range.js") before it and changed my snippet to call it.

require ("range.js");
function selection_or_nothing()

Answer 1: 

    
    
This works here:

I am trying to learn Python from an online course that I purchased.  The instructor uses IntelliJ IDEA as an IDE and since I am trying to follow along I am trying to use it as well.  When I download IntelliJ IDEA and then try to open it I receive the following error message: "No JVM Installation found.  Please install a 32 bit JDK.  If you already have a JDK installed, define a JAVA_Home variable in COmputer
Answer 1: 

    
    

  I tried googling the issue and found my way to the Oracle website

x86 download is the one you need: jdk-8u131-windows-i586.exe.


  Why do I need a JDK for Python development?


IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm are written in Java and run under JVM. 64-bit JVM is bundled and is used automatically, but 32-bit version is not bundled with the recent versions to save on the download size, so you need to install it manually.


  How can I download a 32 bit version of JDK?


See above or use JetBrains Runtime. Latest version: jbsdk8u152b927.2_windows_x86.tar.gz. Instructions.


  What is an easy to learn IDE for Python? I've tried Visual Studio Code
  and PyCharm and have had issues with the set up of both and have not
  found many helpful articles/videos.


IntelliJ IDEA has the same support for Python as PyCharm.

You can use PyCharm Community to get started or PyCharm Edu.

When I open the Structure window in IntelliJ IDEA, the Save delete... option is not accessible for any of the properties:



However, the very same function works from the fields:



When used from the field, it anyway deletes the whole "property", i.e. the field and its getter and setter methods.

Why cannot I access the very same function on the whole property? And the function is in the menu and it is greyed out, so under what condition it is accessible?

I created an issue https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-170415, so I am wandering what the answer from JetBrains is.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Actions such as refactorings are available in the "context" of where in the code structure the carat is positioned.

Therefore if you click on the code for a field, you will see certain refactorings. Or if you position the carat on the class name, you will see other refactorings.

As for how this related to the project structure (alt - 7) - you will notice that if you click on an item in the project structure and then hit f4 (Jump to Source), it will navigate to the exact position in the source code window that relates to that item.

I have often used f4 to navigate from the project structure to the code, and you will notice the available refactorings are identical (between structure view and the code pane).

Now, interestingly (I never tried this before now), if you enable "Properties" (with the P) in the project structure and position the cursor on a property, hit f4 - it does not navigate to the code.

I suspect that there is no link between the "property" and "PSI" structure of the java code (which in turn maps to a specific line in the code pane). Perhaps this is an oversight in intellij, or perhaps it is meant that way since the property can indeed represent 3 different pieces of code (the field, the getter and the setter).

To me it would appear most logical to associate the property with the field itself, so that Jump to Source would navigate to the field (and therefore refactorings would be available) but this isn't the case.
    
    
Title: Delphi - How to build a package for distribution
Description: 
    
    
                    
Using Embarcadero RAD Studio XE7, I wrote a runtime package containing a VCL component (it's a TGraphic descendent). Now I want to distribute this component, but only the compiled package without his source code. I cannot include it in the distribution because I wrote this package for a company that want to sell it and keep the control on his sources, so distributing the source code isn't an alternative in this case.

The component package depends on 2 other packages I also wrote. All of these packages are runtime, however a graphic filter is registered. After the package is installed, this filter allows me to open a new kind of image file from several native VCL components like TImage on my development computer. This behavior is very important and I want to keep it on the target IDEs.

Ideally I want my package to be installed on all RAD Studio platforms between XE and 10.2 Berlin. However I recently tried to compile my package in release on my devel computer and deploy it manually on another computer installed with RAD Studio XE4. The result was unconvincing:


Trying to install the .bpl file using the Component-/lili/lili/li/ulp/pp/pp/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you don't want to to distribute the source files, you then need to provide the .dcu and bpl files. As Uwe says, you need different packages for each Delphi distribution. 

What I have done in the past is to create an installer which builds and registers the packages. You can find the full description here:

http://www.kouraklis.com/2016/10/build-and-install-packages-in-delphi-ide-using-innosetup/

I think you can modify the script to skip the call to MSBuild.

For projects you've already created and don't intend to change, you can add "CONFIG+=c++11 warn_on" as a qmake argument in the project build configuration in Qt Creator:



You can then propagate those settings to shared project settings that become the default for all projects whose builds you haven't configured yet.

This is most helpful if you have lots of projects that you don't wish to modify.

Templates

You can create new projects from a template that has the settings you want. The template includes the prototypical files that constitute a project, e.g. the .pro file, source/header files, README, LICENSE, a default icon, etc. - anything you wish, really.

Qt Creator templates are built up of simple text files that are preprocessed by Qt Creator to substitute entries from the wizard. The wizards can be described in two ways: an older XML-based format, and a newer JSON-based format. See the documentation for more details.

I have an example of a simple XML-based wizard that I use to quickly create StackOverflow answers:

https://github.com/KubaO/stackoverflown/tree/master/qtcreator-templates


  I'd like to have the compiler flags -Wall -pedantic -std=c++11 on by default.


Instead of using platform-specific options, use the cross-platform configuration options. The template should have the following in its .pro file:

CONFIG += c++11 warn_on


These are documented.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I am sorry but qtcreator don't seems to be able to manage the templates for now. What you can do is to get the sources of qtcreator, do the changes you want and then compile an install it. I don't see any other ways to do it.
For example, if you want to add the using namespace in the main.cpp, go to  qt-creator/share/qtcreator/templates/qt4project/main.cpp and add it.

Title: IDE for Compact Framework 3.5 on Windows CE 6
Description: 
    
    
                    
We have some applications running on data reader devices with windows CE 6.0.
These apps was created with genexus generating C# / .Net Compact Framework 3.5

Genexus will not support this anymore and I´m looking for alternatives to rewrite these apps.

First, off course, i thought about Microsoft, but i would have to use visual studio 2008 (too old, my devices are also, but...).
Than i thought about SharpDevelop, but Compact Framework was dropped in version 4.

Does anyone know an alternative to develop C# for Windows CE 6.0?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Visual Studio 2008 (or 2005) is your only option and that's simply never going to change.  Microsoft abandoned the Compact Framework starting in about 2010 and completely in about 2015.  Windows CE itself has effectively been abandoned as well.  There's simply no market for anyone else to even try to make an IDE for development for systems that have zero future.

Each time the code completion is executed, the IDE counts the number of characters it inserted for you (e.g. if you typed "pr" and completed to "print", it'd be 3 characters).

As for quick fixes, it just counts how many of them you invoked (by Alt+Enter). Quick fixes are normally issued on inspection warnings, which is a yellow code and usually it's probable bugs that are highlighted in that way.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I got some java .jar that was not compiled with debug flag. I want to use them in remote debuggin via IDE, so i decompiled them and added as source to the project. Sometimes brake points works wrong or dont even work at all.

The question is, what's the best methodology to debug .jar files that was not compiled with -g flag.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In case it is a maven dependency it might be the -debug artifact is distributed separately. For example this HSQL dependency has both


hsqldb-2.5.0.jar
hsqldb-2.5.0-debug.jar


Unfortunately i didn't find a better way how to force IDE (Intellij IDEA) to download and use this artifact, so i downloaded it manually and replaces in ~/.m2/repository:

wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hsqldb/hsqldb/2.5.0/hsqldb-2.5.0-debug.jar -O ~/.m2/repository/org/hsqldb/hsqldb/2.5.0/hsqldb-2.5.0.jar

Answer 2: 

    
    
This can also happen if you remote debug code that has undergone changes and the changes are not deployed to the remote device.  In a nutshell, the command in the jar does not correspond with the line number in your source.

Someone smarter than me might have a tricky answer, but for me the path of least resistance is to jar up the decompiled and then recompiled code from the jar file and debug that.

99.99% of the time I'm not interested in making actual changes to the jar so much as I simply want to know why my code doesn't work.  Once I'm past that hurdle, I'll drop the original jar back in place and make sure my code still works.  This a) (helps to make sure) that I don't violate the license, and b) doesn't make the project dependent on my code - since decompile/recompile can potentially change the behavior in subtle ways.

Be aware that some jar files have licenses such that simply decompiling the source and looking at it is a license violation.  Although I usually don't worry too much about that since I have no intention of permanently using the decompiled and recompiled code, I just need to "see" it for a while. :)
    
    
Title: Confusion about unit tests (googletest) and projects/folder/files
Description: 
    
    
                    
It's the first time I want to use unit tests in my c++ project. Hence I've many existing classes for which I will write tests (at least for some of them). Further, the application has of course a main() function.

I'm using qt creator with qmake but could also switch to cmake. The project, qt creator and qmake are working nicely.

My confusion is now how do I add unit test? I intent to use googletest. I've already run a test in a new project, testing some dummy add(int, int) function, with everything in one file (function, tests and main). How does that work with an existing project (which has it's own main()). Do I need to setup a second project and include the headers in the test files? What is a good folder structure for that?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In my opinion the best approach is to create a model library (with all the production code), a program executable and a test executable. Then you can link all your production code against the program and test executable. The test-files are also stored in the test executable. All my projects have this structure:

model.lib (link against both exe)
program.exe
modelTest.exe


In the concrete folder on your file system can be stored the test- and production-files. A build tool (like cmake) should separate the files and put the test files into the test executable and the production files into the model-library.

Consider the following example:
I have a folder with the following files:

src (folder)
 - main.cpp
 - model.h
 - model.cpp
 - modelTest.cpp


A cmake file could look like this:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
project(TheUltimateProject)
ADD_EXECUTABLE(program main.cpp)
ADD_library(model shared model.cpp model.h)
ADD_EXECUTABLE(modelTest modelTest.cpp)

target_link_libraries(program model)
target_link_libraries(modelTest model)


If you use a testing-framework like google test, you also have to link the modelTest executable against gmock and don't forget to add the include folder:

e.g.

link_directories($ENV{GMOCK_HOME}/Debug)
include_directories($ENV{GMOCK_HOME}/googlemock/include) 
include_directories($ENV{GMOCK_HOME}/googletest/include)
target_link_libraries(modelTest gmock_main gmock)

    
    
Title: Why I can&#39;t remove this Eclipse plugin after failed installation?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using Eclipse Mars and I have the following problem.

After the installation of a plugin, the Adoe Flash Builder plugin, it is a plugin that is installed outside Eclipse (executing an installer and selecting the Eclipse folder) I have some problem.

The plugin installation failed (because this plugin is supported only on the 32 bit version of Eclipse). So the plugin was not completly installed.

When I start Eclipse I obtain a lot of error messages caused by this failed installation and it is impossible to me work.

So I have tried to disinstall this plugin but it doesn't give me the possibility to uninstall it (the Uninstall button is disabled).

Here the screenshot where you can see that, selecting the plugin that I want to uninstall, the Uninstall button is disabled:



Why? Can I manually delete this plugin in some way? (I have not directory related to it into my Eclipse folder). It seems that in some way Eclipse have the information of this plugin but that this is not effectively present. How can I remove it? Or is faster reinstall and configure again my environment (Eclipse + SVN plugin + project configuration)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I have tried sometimes to get rid of "messed up" eclipse configurations.

In the end, it just didn't work out. I always ended up throwing away everything. 

Besides: Eclipse Neon R2a was released already; so just download that and say goodbye to Mars.

And the real answer (in my opinionated eyes): I decided at some point to enable myself to install eclipse "from scratch" as quickly as possible (for example by having automation where possible; and "checklists" to follow where manual interaction is required). Simply because "installing from scratch" helps avoiding a lot of problems over time.

And while we are talking about eclipse best practices: if your OS is Linux, consider to switch to git-svn instead of SVN. Your machine still talks SVN to the remote SVN server, but you can enjoy the full beauty of git locally. No more SVN plugins, no more hours of waiting for that SVN plugin doing refresh ... I can't tell you how much time that simply change saved for me.

Title: Python3: How to define exceptions in method headers?
Description: 
    
    
                    
yesterday, I found a way to simulate something like type-safety in python 3 (and maybe in python 2 ;). For example by writing the following:

def do_stuff(amount: int, name: str, place: str = 'London') -&gt; list:


you can tell your IDE to notify you if you want to set an argument which has not the expected type (giving a string where you would expect an integer). Python itself ignores them, which is totally fine for me.

However, now I want to provide it with exceptions which may be thrown during the process. How can I achieve this? Unfortunately, I don't even know what to search for. Can someone help me out? I want my IDE (PyCharm) to remind me, that in some cases the function I'm using may throw an exception and it would be a nice idea to wrap it in a try-except statement.

I'm only talking about methods written by myself, not external code and it's for documentation only. Unfortunately reStructuredText or epytext do document this, but don't help with the IDE-checks =Y

Answer 1: 

    
    
This does not appear to be supported. The proposal that added type hinting, PEP484, says this about exceptions:


  No syntax for listing explicitly raised exceptions is proposed. Currently the only known use case for this feature is documentational, in which case the recommendation is to put this information in a docstring.

    
    
Title: In Eclipse, how to know which parameter is the cursor on a Java Method?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Eclipse IDE, I have a Java method with a lot of nullable parameters

src.myCrazyFunction(year, name, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null);


I want to call the function with city parameter 'NY'.
By the use of Javadoc tooltip, I have to count parameters until "String city" and then:

src.myFunction(year, name, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 'NY', null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null);


Counting parameters it's really boring each time I have to use this method.

Could I know the name of the parameter where the cursor is? CTRL+SPACE would be for all the parameters...
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
First thing : you should change this method if it's really like that, it's insane. Second, I don't know what you really mean, but in Eclipse when you will type src. it will show you all the available methods, click on your method and code will be generated with parameter names as arguments (for you to change that). For example if you type "someString".indexOf and you pick a method it will generate "someString".indexOf(ch, fromIndex) (those are not variables or anything, those are parameter names specified in indexOf method declaration, they will give compile-time error if you don't change them). You can see your parameter names, so it's fast to change specific one to NY, you will still have to write the nulls yourself tho. I hope I understood you correctly.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
As explained by @nos in a comment, pressing ctrl+space in Eclipse will popup a tooltip that highlights (in bold) the parameter where the cursor is, as illustrated in in image provided by @nos:


However, that still requires IDE support and is relatively cumbersome to use (you have to position cursor and trigger it to use it), so you should consider other means.

No method should take 24 parameters, but if you absolute must, then your should comment all parameter values that are not self-explanatory, e.g. year and name are probably explanatory enough, but values like null, 0, false, 42, true, etc. does not convey meaning, so you should comment them:

src.myFunction(year,
               name,
               /*address1*/null,
               /*address2*/null,
               /*city*/null,
               /*state*/"NY",
               /*zipcode*/null);


That way a casual observer will know exactly what the values mean.

Another way to do this is to wrap all the parameter values in a POJO and use the builder pattern.

src.myFunction(new MyPojo()
               .setYear(year)
               .setName(name)
               .setState("NY"));

Answer 1: 

    
    
All settings in Sublime Text follow an Order of Precedence. Here's an hypothetical example for JavaScript (in ascending order):


Packages/Default/Preferences.sublime-settings
Packages/Default/Preferences (Windows).sublime-settings
Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings
Packages/JavaScript/JavaScript.sublime-settings
Packages/User/JavaScript.sublime-settings


In this case, the bold settings will override all the others. In your case, a JavaScript package might override your user preferences.

What you can do is define tab_size in Preferences &gt; Settings - Syntax Specific. Make sure you're current view is a JavaScript file before opening the setting.

Title: How can I automate the setup of development tools for new hires?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am looking in a way to have some kind of "image" (VM, Vagrant box, Docker container...???) with all the development tools needed to work on our software project, like a configured IDE (i.e. Eclipse or PyCharm), build and deployment tools.

After a bit of searching I found surprising little about this topic, while plenty about development environments that mirrors the production one. Almost every source I found considers installing development tools on the host, while deploying in a virtualized environment.

The first thing that comes to my mind is a virtual machine of some sort, maybe provisioned in an automated way (Packer + Ansible maybe). I have also seen some blog posts about running GUI applications in Docker containers via X.org.

Is there a better way? How did you solve the problem?

The ultimate goal is to let new hires being productive in hours instead of days.

UPDATE: After some research, I am currently evaluating:


Development in a Virtual Machine
Development with the support of Docker containers
Cloud IDEs

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Have your IT department make an image of a development laptop and then use a confluence page for tweaking the images to the needs of the individual developer. Then use docker images for setting up any servers they will need. These can be run on the laptops. You can use docker swarm to have many docker images spun up if you need it.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I prefer to have dev tools installed on the host so every one do it its own way and I don't want to convert someone to specific tool.

If you want to go the other route and give your new hires a ready to use dev box, I would go with vagrant working in GUI mode + provisioning scripts. For example the jhipster project has a nice dev box, its pretty nice as they have many tools to be installed, its pretty neat so after you install vagrant/virtualbox (or vmware)/git on your host you're ready in minutes. 
    
    
Title: can i use jdeveloper with clearcase dynamic views?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Jdeveloper (Oracle's Java IDE) has a clearcase plugin built by oracle too.
I have worked with it with clearcase snapshots everything works find.

My question is, how to use it with a dynamic view (I am on linux) ?
How do i "set view" with dynamic ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
First, check your ClearCase version: the Oracle jdeveloper ClearCase plugin are quite old.

This thread mentions that JDeveloper 11.1.2 would only support ClearCase 7.0.x, not 7.1.x or later.

But anyway, you can try and see if jdeveloper recognizes a view when using the full path of a dynamic view:

/view/view-tag/full-pathname
/view/myDynamicView/vobs/avob/...


In other words, you do not have to use cleartool setview (which I have always disliked anyway): you can point jdeveloper to the path of the dynamic view (provided the vob used by the config spec is mounted)

My problem is that I get fake warning icons but there is no message of a warning.Why fake? Because when I did an obvious mistake which should show warning, I could find the message in the issues. 

These fakes warnings do not show any messages they are just standing there. 

When I compiled my code on various IDE s no message was shown that why I am completely sure that is not a fault of code. 


IDE:
Qt Creator 3.6.1

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm doing some react.js in PhpStorm 10 and even though JSX Harmony is enabled as the JavaScript language level, it still gives all sorts of nonsense errors.

So I disabled inspection completely for JavaScript but it still gives errors like "expression expected" or "Expecting newline or semicolon".

How do I get ride of those for JS?

    &lt;script type="text/babel"&gt;
        var MyComponent = React.createClass({
           render: function () {
               return &lt;div&gt;

        React.render(&lt;div&gt;&lt;MyComponent text="text1" /&gt;
&lt;MyComponent text="text2" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;, document.getElementById('container'));

Answer 1: 

    
    
At the moment such inline scripts with type="text/babel" are not supported -- IDE only recognizes text/jsx as type for now.

https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-18276 -- watch this ticket (star/vote/comment) to get notified on progress.

Possible workarounds (that I'm aware of):


change type to text/jsx (but then the in-browser babel most likely will not transform it, unless you can configure it somehow)
keep your JS code in a separate .jsx file




UPDATE: (23/03/2016) The aforementioned ticket is now marked as "Fixed" -- this functionality should be available in next update of 2016.1.
    
    
Title: select content between paired brace in pyCharm or any IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I just wonder is there any shortcut to select content in the paired brace instead by selecting them manually in pyCharm or any other IDE? For example,

I want to select

np.mean((predicted == validation).astype(float))


from

print('\n Accuracy:' + str(100*np.mean((predicted == validation).astype(float))) + '%')


So I do not have paired everything and verify it by myself.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use extending selection Ctrl + W. Place the cursor inside and repeat pressing until everything you want is selected. To shrink the selection use Ctrl + Shift + W.

For your example extending selection will work as follows if you place cursor on predicted:

predicted
predicted == validation
(predicted == validation)
(predicted == validation).astype
(predicted == validation).astype(float)
((predicted == validation).astype(float))
np.mean((predicted == validation).astype(float))


If you place it on mean, it goes as follows:

mean
np.mean
np.mean((predicted == validation).astype(float))


Experiment to get a feeling for it.

There is also smart selection with Ctrl + Alt + V, but this is explicit for refactoring. Try it and see if it is what you need. It will split the expression by creating a new variable, assigning the selected expression to it and use the variable in the outer expression. So if I use it for your expression selecting your part it will refactor it to:

mean = np.mean((predicted == validation).astype(float))
print('\n Accuracy:' + str(100* mean) + '%')

    
    
Title: Debugging django templates in pycharm
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've set break points in the template and i run the server but pycharm doesn't seem to pick up the breakpoints for the template but only the python files. Does anyone know how to fix this?  
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
From Pycharm 2017.1
Prerequisite

Django is specified as the project template language.

To do that, open the Project Settings dialog, under the Project Settings select page Python Template Languages, select project where the templates reside, and then choose Django from the Template Language drop-down list.


Debugging a Django template

To debug a Django template, follow these general steps

Place breakpoints in the desired lines of the Django templates:



Launch Django server in the Debug mode.
This is how it's done:

On the main menu, choose Run | Edit Configurations.

If the desired Django Server run/debug configuration exists, select it, otherwise create a new one, as described in the section Creating and Editing Run/Debug Configuration.

Then click the button   on the main toolbar, or press ⌃D.

PyCharm will open the template in your browser, and suspend at the breakpoints you've set.

The Debugger session starts, and Debug tool window appears.
In the Debug tool window, you can:

Examine the rendering contexts in the Variables pane.
Step through the breakpoints defined within the Django template.
Use the debugging console.

If you want to trace back exceptions that are raised in course of template debugging, open Breakpoints dialog,  and in the Django Exception Breakpoints tab, select the check box Suspend.

Debugging Jinja and Mako templates is not supported.

Without creating a new project for each bug/ticket I have to work in within a project, is it possible to save the open files for each of the different bugs/ticket I am working on.

As a very simple example, I am working on Project Golf and have two bugs. #1 - Add CRUD functionality for Player. #2 - Add CRUD functionality for Course.

Within Bug #1 I am working on files views/players/index.php, views/players/add.php, views/players/edit.php and views/players/view.php

Within Bug #2 I am working on files views/courses/index.php, views/courses/add.php, views/courses/edit.php and views/courses/view.php

I would like to be able to easily switch between bug by opening project Golf /strongstrong
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you are using integration with an Issue Tracking System in PhpStorm then IDE will load your tabs that you had open when last time worked on that particular ticket/task.

Regardless if you use such integration or not -- this functionality is called "Contexts" and you can switch between them using Tools | Tasks &amp; Contexts | Load Context.

I have upgraded to Windows 10 and the font being used in the IDE is no longer monospaced and I cannot change. This what the options screen looks like:



As you can see, the Editor font settings are grayed out and cannot be changed.

Even though it says "Monospaced", the IDE editor font is not monospaced which is insanely annoying because space indents are no longer lining up. How can I solve this problem?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You cannot change the font, because you've selected the Default scheme name, which is read-only.

Click on Save as and enter a scheme name to make a copy, which will become editable.
    
    
Title: Endless directory recursion in IntelliJ IDEA 15
Description: 
    
    
                    
Directory target/test-classes keeps cascading on every build (see image below). I created the project as "maven". I guess there is something wrong with project settings but I can't find out what.

Paths configured for module:
Output path: E:\data\selenium-java\ShmetsyServer\target\classes
Test output path: E:\data\selenium-java\ShmetsyServer\target\test-classes
[v] exclude output paths (checked)

There are no tests (yet) in this project. 
Also I notice src/tests directory is missing (it was there when I created the project). I probably deleted it by mistake. I created src/tests/java and src/tests/resources again, but target/test-classes/target still gets filled with recursion.


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It's a strange thing on your screenshot. You can try open project structure (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S), go to Modules tab and check if your target directory marked only as Excluded. If this directory marked as something else you should remove these marks. 

Also project root folder should not be marked with any option.
