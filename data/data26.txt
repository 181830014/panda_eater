I have the following problem using the Eclipse debugger.

I have to inspect a ResultSet rs object containing some rows obtained from a query.

I put my rs object into the Eclipse debugger expression area to analize it content but I can't understand how do the following things:


Where are stored the number of rows contained into my ResultSet object.
How can I see the rows inside the expression area of the debugger? (I want see the rows and its content)

You can't:

https://www.java67.com/2018/01/jdbc-how-to-get-row-and-column-count-from-resultset-java.html

Because Java Database Connectivity uses a streaming API, it doesn't return all of the results at once.
    
    
Title: How can I view the Bean Graph for @Autowired beans in Spring STS?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am able to view the Bean Graph for any beans wired through XML, but when I have beans that are @Autowired through annotations, it doesn't show any arrows between them.



According to STS #171 and STS #1066 it was implemented a long time ago.

Note: Last tested with STS 3.4.0.RELEASE



If I deploy to tcServer and do Live Bean Graph, then it works, but not using regular view.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The improvement feature was requested and even closed; but new tickets still say that feature is requested - and not closed yet even (STS-2396) in 2.8. I haven't succeeded getting there. No joy :(

Issue says - "When STS is resolving autowired beans for either validation purposes or for the bean graph, it seems to only to be able to find beans that have their type explicitly defined."
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you are using Spring boot you can use spring acutator to view all the beans..

Spring acutator enables /beans endpoint which shows all beans in JSON format. 

Once you start the Spring boot app all you need to do is http://localhost:8080/beans
    
    
Title: intelliJidea plus Gradle, where can i find Compiler Ouput?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Don't know if this is because android-studio does something wrong, or just common to all gradle projects in intelliJ, but sometimes when i run the build/debug, all I get is:

Gradle: 
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':ProjectA:compileDebug'.
&gt; Compilation failed; see the compiler error output for details.

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.


I can't seem to find any way to get more information, as this text already appear on what i consider to be the compiler output.

Where should I be looking at?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
One thing I've done to get some better information is go to the project root via the command line and run

this does give more information, but I'm not 100% sure its running the same command as the IDE.
    
    
Title: IDE generated USEFORM macro calls changing their order
Description: 
    
    
                    
We have a C++Builder XE project (VCL Forms Application) that has a few dozen forms and units in it. Whenever a file belonging to the project is added, deleted, or renamed, the IDE should do two things:


A call to USEFORM macro is added to or altered in the Project Source file (ProjectName.cpp) if the affected unit is a form or frame
A CppCompile element in the project file (ProjectName.cbproj) is added or altered


However instead of just doing the necessary changes, the IDE shuffles some of the existing USEFORMs and CppCompile records, even if they aren't affected by the changes. If I add a Unit (cpp and header file), the USEFORMs are shuffled even when that wouldn't require any changes to the Project Source, only to the cbproj-file.

I don't see a specific pattern on how the new order is formed. If I edit or rename a single unit, about half of the USEFORMs seem to change position and just a couple or none of the CppCompile records. If a change is made to a copy of the project in two different machines, most of the changes seem to be similar, but not all. This indicates that the reordering is not random.

The behaviour causes problems when using Subversion to merge changes, because it forces to manually resolve conflicts inflicted by the changing order.

So the question is: What might be causing the foregoing behaviour and how to get rid of it?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I haven't been able to find a proper solution to the problem, but here's a simple method for making it slightly less annoying:

Adopt a policy of never committing the random IDE-generated changes to the version control repository. Whenever you make changes to code that trigger mixing up the files, revert all unnecessary changes in ProjectName.cpp and ProjectName.cbproj. At this point it is still fairly easy, as you know which parts of the files actually should have changed. That way, the manual labour is carried out when it still requires the minimal amount of work. Additionally, the work has to be carried out only once, in contrast to leaving the changes untouched, in which case the work has to be repeated every time someone merges the changes.

Though I have looked at these two questions, fold sub blocks and manually fold code.

But it doesnt seems to work, because either the links are broken or some of the resources are unavailable.

In my project, I have lot of functions, which include literally millions of if/else statements. Now, whenever I have to look for a Log, I have to shuffle the entire code. Most of the time is wasted in the if/else code blocks. It would be really helpfull, if I could fold these if/else sub blocks. There is no inbuilt feature in eclipse though. Is there any plugin that could help for the purpose.

Title: Eclipse 3.8: Call Hierarchy misses callers from jars
Description: 
    
    
                    
The Call Hierarchy view in Eclipse JDT 3.8 seems to show only the references / callers from the own classes in the current project / working set. 
Callers from jars / libraries are not shown any more.

In contrast, in eclipse &lt;= 3.6 this showed all callers, including the ones from libraries.

Example:


CTRL-SHIFT-T; open DocumentBuilderFactory
In the method outline, right click at setAttribute()
Select Call Hierarchy from context menu
Ensure Show Caller Hierarchy is enabled in the Call hierarchy settings.


Eclipse 3.8 shows no matches, while Eclipse 3.6 shows (at least) one match
(tested with jdk 6)

(In the "Search in" setting, all options are checked)

Question: Is there a way to enable the previous behavior in eclipse 3.8 or is it a bug?

(same issue can be seen in the "Show Callee Hierachy" mode - it does not show any internal callees any more from a jdk class, e.g. compare callees of ArrayList.get())

Description: 
    
    
                    
How can I word-wrap long lines of scripts and functions in the MATLAB R2011b Editor?

I don't mean using Ctrl+J to wrap comments, but show a long line over several lines, each (except the last) the width of the editor frame, as in most text editors, so I don't need to scroll horizontally; the effect is purely visual and it remains as a single line in the file.

I could not find a setting in any menu, toolbar or the preferences dialog.

Though I could split the line into multiple lines using "...", I don't want to do this. I want to keep it as one line in the file, just show it wrapped, as in Format /p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
The way to do this is by using the three dots ... For example:

Hc_frame_1 = uicontrol(gcf, ...
'Style', 'frame',...
'Units', 'pixels',...
'Position', [25 250 200 230]);


These three dots tell MATLAB to continue the command on the next line. Without them MATLAB will think that the command is incomplete.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There is no way to wrap general text in the editor. 

It can be set to do so but just for comments.

One of the most famous features of IDEs is as you know finding references (or usages) of variables, functions or classes in a project. I have been trying Atom Atom) for a while. I like it so far. But, I could not find a way to access to references (or usages) of var/function or a class in JavaScript code. Isn't this feature available in Atom editor? I give two examples below.

a) In the following simple code, Atom does not take me the declaration of "title". I am making "Go to Declaration" by right clicking on the word "title" 

Template.docAddForm.events({
    'submit .js-add-doc':function(event){
         const title = event.target.doctitle.value; // The declaration of "title"
         Session.set('docTitle', title);  // Cannot access the declaration of "title" in Atom
    }
});


Another example. I cannot access to declaration of Users object which is a Collection declared in imported "commons.js" in the following code.

import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import {Users} from '../lib/commons.js';

/** PUBLICATIONS **/
Meteor.publish('users', function () {

Answer 1: 

    
    
You can solve this with one of the following solutions:

Update:

As of Android studio 3.0, it becomes much easier as it now shows a more helpful hint, so we only need to follow this hint.
for example:



  All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version
  specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found
  versions 27.0.2, 26.1.0. Examples include
  com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:27.0.2 and
  com.android.support:customtabs:26.1.0
  
  there are some combinations of libraries, or tools and libraries, that
  are incompatible, or can lead to bugs. One such incompatibility is
  compiling with a version of the Android support libraries that is not
  the latest version (or in particular, a version lower than your
  targetSdkVersion.)


Solution:
Add explicitly the library with the old version but with a new version number.
in my case com.android.support:customtabs:26.1.0 so I need to add:  

implementation "com.android.support:customtabs:27.0.2"  


ie: Take the library from the second item, and implement it with the version number from the first.

Note: don't forget to press sync now so gradle can rebuild the dependency graph and see if there are any more conflicts.

Explanation:
you may be confused by the error message as don't use customtabs so how I have a conflict!!
well.. you didn't use it directly but one of your libraries uses an old version of customtabs internally, so you need to ask for it directly.  

if you curious to know which of your libraries is responsible for the old version and maybe ask the author to update his lib, Run a Gradle dependency report, see the old answer to know how.

Note this 



Old answer:

inspired by CommonsWare answer:

Run a Gradle dependency report to see what your full tree of
dependencies is.

From there, you will see which one of your libraries are asking for a different version of the Android Support libraries.
For whatever it is asking for, you can ask for it directly with the
25.2.0 version or use Gradle's other conflict resolution approaches to get the same versions.



Update:

As of gradle plugin version: 3.0 compile has been replaced by implementation or api see this answer for the difference.

hence use instead:

./gradlew -q dependencies app:dependencies --configuration debugAndroidTestCompileClasspath


or for windows cmd: 

gradlew -q dependencies app:dependencies --configuration debugAndroidTestCompileClasspath


and search for the conflicted version.

For me, the error disappeared after removing com.google.android.gms:play-services:10.2.0

And only include com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:10.2.0 and com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:10.2.0 as they are the only two play services that I use.

I think the gms:play-services depend on some old components of the support library, so we need to add them explicitly ourselves.



for AS 3.0 an older.

Run:

./gradlew -q dependencies &lt;module-name&gt;:dependencies --configuration implementation


Example:

./gradlew -q dependencies app:dependencies --configuration implementation




if someone knows a better way in the new gradle plugin please let me know.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    

Go to project/.idea/libraries folder on your file system and see which libraries are different.
You will have to manually include these libraries with the same version in your build.gradle file.
Then, sync your project.


E.g.:

compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.2.0'

// Wrong library version found on 1st point
compile 'com.android.support:customtabs:25.2.0'

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
For all cases, not just for these versions or libraries:

Pay attention to the little information window that say something about the error, it says the examples that you have to change and add.

In this case:


  Found versions 25.1.1, 24.0.0. Examples include com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.1.1 and
  com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0


Your 


  com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.1.1


is version 25.1.1, and your 


  com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0


is version 24.0.0, so you have to add the mediarouter with the same version:

com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:25.1.1


And do that for every example that the little information window says, in this case all the libraries that doesn't have the version 25.1.1.

You have to sync the gradle after you fix the indicated library to see the next library and package that you have to change.

IMPORTANT:

If you are not explicitly using one or more specified libraries and it is giving you the error, it means that is being used internally by another library, compile it explicitly anyway.

You also can use another method to see the difference of the versions of all the libraries that you are actually compiling (like run a gradle dependency report or go to your libraries files), the real objetive is compile all the libraries that you are using with the same version.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
The best way to solve the problem is implement all 'com.android.support:...' suggested by Android Studio

(Doesn't matter which support versions you are using &ndash; 27.1.1, 28.0.0 etc.)

Place the cursor to the error line e.g.

implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'


Android Studio will suggest you which 'com.android.support:...' is different version than
'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'

Example


  All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found versions 28.0.0, 27.1.0, 27.0.2. Examples include com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:28.0.0 and com.android.support:exifinterface:27.1.0


So add com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:28.0.0
 &amp; com.android.support:exifinterface:28.0.0.
Now sync gradle file.

One by one try to implement all the suggested 'com.android.support:...' until there is no error in this line implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'

In my case, I added

implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'

implementation 'com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:28.0.0'
implementation 'com.android.support:exifinterface:28.0.0'
implementation 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:28.0.0'
implementation 'com.android.support:customtabs:28.0.0'
implementation 'com.android.support:support-media-compat:28.0.0'
implementation 'com.android.support:support-v4:28.0.0'


All these dependencies, it could be different for you.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Add this to the very end of your build.gradle (Module:app):

configurations.all {
resolutionStrategy.eachDependency { DependencyResolveDetails details -&gt;
    def requested = details.requested
    if (requested.group == 'com.android.support') {
        if (!requested.name.startsWith("multidex")) {
            details.useVersion '25.3.1'
        }
     }

   }
}


Make sure that you replace '25.3.1' with the version of the android support library that you want to use for all the dependencies , it should not be lower than your complile sdk version

than re sync gradle
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I had the exact same problem after updating to Android Studio 2.3

Adding this line to dependencies solved my problem:

compile 'com.android.support:customtabs:25.2.0'

    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
A) Run gradle dependencies or ./gradlew dependencies

B) Look at your tree and figure out which of your dependencies is specifying a different support library version for a dependency you don't control.

I didn't realize that this warning also displays if the dependency is completely unused directly by your own code. In my case, Facebook specifies some support libs I wasn't using, you can see below most of those dependencies were overridden by my own specification of 25.2.0, denoted by the -/strong/pprecode/code/prep/pblockquotep/p/blockquotepcode/code/pprecode/code/pre/div
Answer 8: 

    
    
Use variables: Doing something like the following will make it easier for you to ensure that you use the same version with all libraries

        google_play_services_version = '10.2.0'

If the same error is on appcompat

implementation 'com.android.support:design:27.0.1'


For me, adding

implementation 'de.mrmaffen:vlc-android-sdk:2.0.6'


was including appcompat-v7:23.1.1 in 


  .idea/libraries

in the above image you can see that 23.4.0 is creating the problem but this we not able to find in our gradle file. So now this version number(23.4.0) will save us. When we have this number then we will find this number in the result of above command result and directly import that dependency directly in our gradle file. Please see the below image to get the clear view.



you can clearly see that com.android.support:cardview-v7:23.4.0 and com.android.support:customtabs:23.4.0 are using the version which is creating the problem. Now just simply copy those line from dependency
list and explicitly use in our gradle file but with the updated version link 

implementation "com.android.support:cardview-v7:26.1.0"
    implementation "com.android.support:customtabs:26.1.0"

Another way to solve conflicts is just to force the correct version for all dependencies like this:

dependencies {
            configurations.all {
                resolutionStrategy.eachDependency { DependencyResolveDetails details -&gt;
                    if (details.requested.group == 'com.android.support' &amp;&amp; details.requested.name == 'support-v4') {
                        details.useVersion "27.0.2"
                    }
                }
    ...
    }

My problem is similar to yours.
Here exist an error!

compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.3.0'

All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found versions 25.3.0, 24.0.0. Examples include 'com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.3.0' and 'com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0'

Seeing this 
Examples include 'com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.3.0' and 'com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0'

I had the same problem before and I got the solution for it.

I just added the libraries that had the another version but with the same version of my support:appcompat.

For your error for example :


  All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version
  specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found
  versions 25.1.1, 24.0.0. Examples include
  com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:25.1.1 and
  com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:24.0.0


*The solution is to compile the versions of these libraries like that :

compile 'com.android.support:mediarouter-v7:25.1.1'

-if another library had the same issue and had another version just compile it with your support:appcompat version

This resolved my problem and I hope it resolves yours.

After searching and combining answers, 2018 version of this question and it worked for me:

1) On navigation tab change it to project view

2) Navigate to [YourProjectName]/.idea/libraries/

3) Delete all files starting with Gradle__com_android_support_[libraryName]

E.g: Gradle__com_android_support_animated_vector_drawable_26_0_0.xml

4) In your gradle file define a variable and use it to replace version number like ${variableName}

Def variable:

ext {
    support_library_version = '28.0.0' //use the version of choice
}


Use variable:

implementation "com.android.support:cardview-v7:${support_library_version}"


example gradle:

dependencies {
    ext {
        support_library_version = '28.0.0' //use the version of choice
    }

    implementation fileTree(include: ['*.jar'], dir: 'libs')

Very Simple with the new version of the android studio 3.x.

Just copy the version that is less than the current version and add it explicitly with same version number as current version. 

Example 


  Found versions 27.1.1, 27.1.0. Examples include com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:27.1.1 and com.android.support:exifinterface:27.1.0


Just copy the version com.android.support:exifinterface:27.1.0 and change it to com.android.support:exifinterface:27.1.1 so that it becomes equal to the current version you are using and add it to your gradle dependencies as following. 

implementation 'com.android.support:exifinterface:27.1.1'

In this case, I was targeting 25.3.1, and had some dependencies targeting different versions when I ran this command. The trick is to identify the dependencies in this list that are targeting previous versions, and overriding that by importing the most recent version of the dependency in Gradle.

    compile ('a library C which use DIFFERENT 'com.android.support...' (ex:27.0.1) {

        // If you want to use 26.0.1 use
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: '...' (ex module: 'appcompat-v7') 
        exclude group: 'com.android.support', module: 'another module'
        ...

        // If you want to use 27.0.1 do 
        Upgrade `compileSdkVersion` and all 'com.android.support' to 27.0.1.
        (It may be a good solution because the best practice is always use latest `compileSdkVersion`.  
        However, use 26 or 27 is base on you for example higher library may have bug)

Title: Can you create an external PHPdoc for a class?
Description: 
    
    
                    
let's say I have the following

class Something extends ClassWithMagicMethods{}


Normally I would add a docblock for any properties I know exist even if accessed via a magic method

/**
 * @property string $someVar
 * @method SomeClass getSomeClass()
 */
class Something extends ClassWithMagicMethods{}


Which works great, but what I'm wondering is if we can have that docblock separate from the definition of the class. Two possible usecases:


Third party package that doesn't include the docblock but I want autocompletion from my IDE - I'd like to be able to just add my own docblock somewhere for it.
An extension system - In the file where the extension is defined I'd like to document the new properties this extension adds to the class.


I'm aware I could technically create a dummy ide_helper.php file that never actually gets run - just indexed by the IDE - unfortunately this causes any decent IDE to complain about duplicate declarations which I don't want as it also makes code navigation slower.

So - is it possible to document a PHP class by composing multiple docblocks external from the class definition?

Most of the results I've pulled up on SO are referencing just documenting unknown types where you use them which isn't what I need. I.E:

/** @var Something $something */
$something = FactoryMethodThing::create('Something');

I just started trying out PyCharm, and while it is very nice, I found the interactive console in debugger (that can be activated with "Show Python Prompt" on a breakpoint) is unusably slow. If I keep pressing enter, for example, after 2-3 tries, I have to wait several seconds for the next prompt to show up. 

Is this a common experience? I'm running Pycharm with a pretty fast machine (with i7-3770 CPU) so I was wondering if something is wrong.

I too have experienced the same problem quite a few times but With every new version released new problem too pop out . Its not the first time PyCharm is giving some one a hard time. In previous version the IDE would just stop working or not debug at all . 

The best way to solve this is by writing to Jet Brains so they can find and solve the issue and release a new update.

Android-studio is not hiding the file, it is developed so as to show the generated files folder only.It won't show you either the oututs folder.You can verify this by moving your .apk file to say resource(res) folder and you will be able to see that.

To show the output folder in Android Studio, just rename it to output by going to the place where you saved your files. Then you will see your output folder in Android Studio.
    
    
Title: Map &ldquo;Ctrl + Left click&rdquo; to &ldquo;Go to definition&rdquo; in Monodevelop
Description: 
    
    
                    
From Eclipse and IntelliJ I'm used to holding Ctrl and left-clicking to Go to definition.

Monodevelop also provides a Go to definition feature, but I wasn't able to map it to my favorite Ctrl+ left-click. I know how to map actions to keyboard shortcuts in Monodevelop, but it seems that there is no way to use mouse clicks in these mappings.

Any idea how to get this working? Or maybe there is a plugin for that?

In monodevelop 7.8 this option is exist. Edit/Preferences/Key Bindings, then search "go to declaration" You can find it there. F12 is default key. I'm an old eclipse user and I used F3. I changed F3 the shortcut and I become happy :)

I was having trouble in Watch Window when I try to watch any type, I keep getting error "The type or namespace name '[Type]' is not valid in this scope". I had to give the full namespace along with the type in the watch window to fix this error.

This is just an example it happens for any type - 

If I add a watch like new Uri(Location)  watch window shows the error. So I should include the namespace new System.Uri(Location) for it to work. This was more of an annoyance.

Make sure you have a correctly spelled "using" statement for the namespace. If you've written the using statement only for a particular block, you have to implicitly declare the namespace when debugging or even coding out of that block to access the the namespace.

Make sure the context is selected underneath your template text. There is a small 'Change' link there where you set the context. I had to choose all contexts.

    
    
Title: Multi-IDE Support in Java for one Team
Description: 
    
    
                    
What is the best way to allow a team of programmers to use Netbeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ on the same project, thus eliminating the "which IDE is better" question.

Which files should or should not be checked into source code control?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I think the best way is to make the build process independent of IDE. This means that your project should not rely on any IDE-specific files to build, but rather use an external build system, like Apache Maven, Apache Ant, or even make or custom scripts. Maven is supported by most popular Java IDEs, either directly or via plug-ins.

If you don't want to use an external build systems, you should at least make the project as easy to set up as possible (i.e. by having standard folders for shared libraries and other dependencies). When I have working  on teams with multiple IDEs in the past, I spent by far the most time on resolving dependencies as the prerequisites for building the project changed over time. In the worst case you may even end up with developers not bothering to get the latest version from the version control repository, since they think setting up the new project is such a hassle.

If your project has many library dependencies, I think its a good idea to make these available in binary form in the version control repository. That way people don't have to resolve all the dependencies of the dependencies and so on just to build a single project. This does however require that you have someone responsible for keeping the "official" binaries up-to-date whenever they change. (This is pretty much the same philosophy used by the Maven repository, but the principles can be applied manually even when not using Maven.)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Well, that's a pretty self-answering question.

The files to not check into source control are files that have to do with the IDEs themselves.

Leave it to the developers to generate these files.

If you use Maven, it can generate the files such as Eclipse's .project and .classpath for you. Eclipse in general is very easy to use with a basic file structure (with the new Java Project option).

I think Maven has Netbeans support as well, not sure about IntelliJ though.

Maven's site is maven.apache.org.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
For each IDE that has more than one developer, check-in all the supporting files. Why re-invent the wheel at every desk.

I have done this with many different IDEs, and I have yet to see a filename conflict.

In fact, even when only a single developer uses a particular IDE, it is to his/her advantage to version the supporting files, for the same reason that you version the other files in your development environment: history, diffing, comments, etc.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
For Eclipse, that would be .classpath and .project files.

My team uses Maven, and developers are discouraged from checking in Eclipse-specific files. Because they can be generated from Maven, these files are redundant.

Also, checking project-specific files seems like it would save time, but it usually winds up being a pain because of variations in different developers' workstations, resulting in wasted time resolving conflicts in the IDE-specific files. The only way to get around that is to force everyone to set up their environment the same way, which goes against the IDE-agnostic approach.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
There are many considerations when using multiple toolsets within the same project team. For example, my team has Java developers using IntelliJ and most of the front end (JSP/CSS/HTML) developers using eclipse. We are in the process of migrating the Eclipse users to IntelliJ because of some IntelliJ plugins that we have developed that provide extended support for our environment. We're not going to develop the plugins for multiple platforms, so we are standardizing on IntelliJ across the board.

In terms of specific files, I can speak to IntelliJ. We have checked in our .ipr files and our .iml files. Do not check in .iws files. If you also have Eclipse users, configure your IntelliJ project to read/store dependency information in the .classpath file and commit that to your VCS.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
We intentionally support multiple IDEs from the same SVN repository.  Our thinking was that we want to ensure that, if a new person joined the team or someone had to start working on a new machine, we wanted them to be able to checkout the codebase, import it to the IDE and immediately have a work-able configuration.

What that means on the developer end is that they should not commit their changes to the IDE files.  Everything else (e.g., src, test, lib and so forth) becomes the set that we normally update and commit every day.

The side benefit is that we have completely eliminated the IDE wars here: Netbeans and Eclipse people live in perfect harmony (looking askance at the IntelliJ people, but hey... ;-).
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
For more comments and answers on this topic see this question (How do you handle different Java IDEs and svn?) 
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
We rename our IDE files for checkin with an extra extension .deletethis or similar.  When a new person checks out the project, they simply strip off the extra extension and are good to go.  This way we avoid source control conflicts with the project files as people tweak their environments.  And you don't have to worry about educating new developers to not check in those files.
    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
Typically, I would consider this a bad idea.  I'm not sure what kind of environment this is (perhaps open source?), but it would really suck to support multiple IDEs.  One thing I would recomend if this is unavoidable, would be to standardize your builds in ant scripts.  If you have a large set of dependencies, this may be the easiest way to get a predictable build across all platforms.  

If one of the IDEs happens to be RAD (based on eclipse), there is an entire folder called .settings that you would not want to include in the SCM.
    
    
Title: Delphi XE4 &ldquo;class not found&rdquo; but compiles fine
Description: 
    
    
                    
The GUI for my company's main product was written in Delphi in the late '90's, and has been updated to Delphi 2007. I'm working with a group to update the Delphi 2007 to XE4. 

We still use a number of components from ADL VCL (similar to DevExpress, but now defunct), but have not installed the entire package. Rather, we have the files we need located in a folder seperate from our project folder, and have the path to these files specified in:
Tools-Options-Library-browsing path
and
Project-Options-search path

When I open main, I get the error: 
"TADLAboutBox not found. Ignore the error and continue?"

The unit "ADLAbout" that defines "ADLAboutBox" is declared in the uses clause in main.
Moreover, our project compiles just fine. 

How can I get rid of these messages? What might be wrong?

Thanks very much for your advice.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
ADL VCL is not available for XE4, since it was discontinued some time before XE4 was released. If you have the ADL source code, and have ported it to XE4, then it's plausible that you may have some success.

The error message you describe is symptomatic of not having the design-time packages for the components installed. You'll need to build and install design-time packages for any components that you want to interact with at design-time.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The component is not installed in the IDE, so when you open a form that uses that component you get an error.

But the source to the component can be found so when you compile it will do that without problems.

To get rid of the error you must install the component in the IDE.

Okay, so I found a solution that works. This Stackoverflow thread was using command-line to update the SDK. I went into my tools/ and ran:

That pulled all the necessary SDK components from the server. Once it was done, I was able to point Android Studio to the standalone SDK folder and things seemingly work now.

I had the exact same problem on Mac OS X. Here is how I fixed it. Open terminal and use the following commands.

$cd ~/Library/Android/sdk/tools/

$./android update sdk --no-ui --filter 1


It will start the update of package in non-gui mode and ask for permission etc. and finally install well.

The android command that many of the above answers use is now deprecated, and may or may not work for recent installations.

in our company we are switching to Java. We want to develop Web Applications using the Spring Framework. We had 4 days of training where the trainer showed us Java using the Springsource Tool Suite which is based on Eclipse. 
However i have used previously NetBeans for developing PHP applications. 

What do i lose using NetBeans 7.0 compared to using Springsource Tool Suite 2.7.0? Is it really worth developing Spring Framework Web Applications using the dedicated Springsource Tool Suite with having in mind that we are novice in Java?

UPDATE
To provide more information: we want to use the following technologies: 
 - Spring Framework 3
 - JPA (Hibernate)
 - Apache Wicket
 - Maven

STS has built in Spring refactoring facility - one among a variety of reasons why STS is the preferred choice for spring development. So for example, you were changing the bean names, the STS will automatically update the bean definition XML files.

I personally prefer eclipse over Intellij Idea; since eclipse is more lightweight than IDEA. Since STS is built on top of eclipse, that makes STS my preference too.

All the spring tutorials and examples by springsource are in STS.

STS is free whereas IDEA is not. I haven't used Netbeans though.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I would recommend IntelliJ over Eclipse.  I can't speak for STS, since I've never used it, but IntelliJ's Spring support is excellent.  

I couldn't disagree more with the comment above stating that Eclipse is lightweight.

STS is the best IDE for Spring IMO. Besides Spring ,it includes Maven, Spring Roo which I like very much and there is a version that includes Google's App Engine SDK and GWT SDK.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I think the biggest reason to go with STS is that the majority of developers using spring choose that IDE.  Most of the tutorials, forum posts and documentation you view will be based on STS.  I also like how maven and tomcat are prepackaged in the IDE.  Also the Spring Template Projects easily port into STS, these projects are extremely helpful because they are prewired.  I'm not sure if you can get them through netbeans without a bunch of initial configuration of maven.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I suggest using IntelliJ IDEA. It is the best IDE for developing SpringSource applications in my opinion. You can demo the ultimate version it or use the Community edition.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I like IntelliJ quite a bit.  However, if you are an Eclipse shop, look at SpringSource Tool Suite http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts

There are many helpful tools in STS specifically designed for Spring Developers.  Check out my DZone Refcard which was just published this week http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/eclipse-tools-spring
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
I like to use IntelliJ IDEA. It has some advanced code related suggestion which would give not only benefit for Spring Framework, but also other frameworks. To me, it is the complete IDE. For Spring it gives convenient auto detection feature. The code navigation for Spring Framework in IntelliJ IDEA gives uniqueness and convenience.
    
    
Title: How to debug deployed Grails application
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there any way to debug Grails application deployed to production server in Intellij IDEA or any other IDE?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You need to start your server in debug mode by adding something like this to the java process start script:

-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n


Then in IntelliJ open Run &gt; Edit Configurations and select Defaults &gt; Remote, where you can set the port you specified above to debug the remote JVM.

You can do the same in Eclipse.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Also you can use grails-debug run-app to debug Grails application. But I think it's not good choice for production
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Also, starting from grails 2.3.0 the jvm is forked into the build vm and the application vm. Using --debug allow you to debug the build vm, and using --debug-fork allows you to debug the app vm. Grails 2.3 forked execution

If you do not see XML Editor option under Open With menu, you don't have XML Editor installed. Either get a different Eclipse package (such as Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers) or install XML Editor from Kepler update site.

Just search for XML when the big list of features comes up.

You might have the file open with the Eclipse text editor, not the XML editor. I am not using Kepler, but in previous versions you simply

Title: Where to start with ASP.net in C# and Dreamweaver?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am looking to start working on a personal site using C#.  I work as a web developer and have used VBScript previously and am using Coldfusion now at work.  I use Dreamweaver for development in these languages.

I have read a lot of people recommending that you should use a MS IDE to develop in .net and that C# is the way to go in terms of the language.  I would like to stick with Dreamweaver as I feel I would be taking on a bit too much to learn how to use a new IDE and a new language at the same time.  

Will using something like Visual Studio help with developing in .net so much that it is worth the effort of changing from Dreamweaver?
If so which IDE would be best to learn with?

If I choose to stick with Dreamweaver is there any recommendations you can make as to how to best setup Dreamweaver for easy development?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I believe not. Dreamweaver is not a good tool for developing code. This is what you need in ASP.NET. You'll need debugging. You'll enjoy IntelliSense, and you can always open single files in Dreamweaver occasionally (which I doubt you would, anyway). 

Grab Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web (which is free) and enjoy. It's a Windows app, like many other Windows apps! You don't need professional training to use it. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
As someone who formerly coded PHP in Dreamweaver, I would strongly suggest the use of the Visual Studio IDE for C# ASP.NET applications. The benefits are numerous:


Intellisense - where any object, property, method, etc. that you create will automatically appear in an auto-complete box, drastically reducing syntax errors
Project templates - starting a web application from scratch is going to be very very tricky if you have to do it all via source code
Debugging - errors can be caught and debugged directly in the source code
Add-ins - my favorite being the Configuration Section Designer


I'm sure there are even more reasons, these are just the biggest ones.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If you feel comfortable using Dreamweaver for design, you can still continue to use it, but I would strongly recommend you familiarise yourself with Visual Studio Express however (it's free). Trying to learn .NET and C# using a text editor or an application like dreamweaver is feasible, but you would be making the learning process unnecessarily difficult. Visual Studio gives you syntax highlighting, intellisense, debugging, and many other features that you just aren't going to get in another IDE targeted at web design. VS is really very strongly coupled to .NET development.

I started my career as a web designer many years ago using Dreamweaver, and have gradually made the transition to software developer. Leaving tools like Dreamweaver behind has actually given me a lot more freedom in terms of working as a designer, and I find that I don't in fact need any tools for markup and css other than a text editor. You may find that abandoning a design tool like dreamweaver actually makes you a better designer; and just as well - the "design" tools in Visual Studio are absolutely useless :)

If you do decide to continue using Dreamweaver for markup, be aware that things may render differently in Visual Studio. Ignore the Visual Studio design pane entirely and just check your design in the various browsers (I'm sure you already do this).
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I think you would be very disappointed with the ASP.NET support in Dreamweaver.  You would be MUCH better off getting yourself a copy of Visual Studio / Web Developer (express editions are free) and doing your development there.

That said, there's no reason why you can't create your HTML and CSS in Dreamweaver, then bring those files into Visual Studio to actually put in the code.  This is kind of a one-time deal though since usually once you've started splitting up your HTML into master pages and user controls/partial views, it's pretty difficult to go back and edit them again in Dreamweaver.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Visual Studio 2008 will be probably better. Not only IntelliSense, but also debugging in JavaScript can be helpfull sometimes (don't know is it included in the Express edition).  
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Yes, coming from the exact same situation I can tell you now it will help a great deal to walk away from Dreamweaver for your .net work. The intellisense for C# is not super great in Dreamweaver. You will find features you miss a great deal from Dreamweaver though, specifically code completion on the HTML side is much better in Dreamweaver then in VS. 
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Another vote for Visual Studio, with the addition that you don't have to give up Dreamweaver.  You can use Dreamweaver to build a basic layout and interface design.  Then use Visual Studio to realize the implementation of that design.

You will find building ASP.Net without a purpose-build IDE painful.
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
I'd really like to point out that "IntelliSense" is nothing new and nothing Microsoft invented by any means. IntelliSense IS code hinting with links to the Microsoft help page, which I've never needed personally. Please see that Dreamweaver does have code hinting exactly the same as Visual Studio, however is not designed to develop C# and similar languages, and for that reason alone I would not recommend trying to develop with it.
As for developing purely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a plain text editor is a better choice than Visual Studio granted you don't change any of the settings. There are so many things I hate about how VS behaves while I'm writing HTML, but that's another thread. On another site.
    
    
Title: Visual Studio 2017 RC Setup Operation Failed
Description: 
    
    
                    
I first tried to install VS 2017 RC and a problem occurred during installation. I tried to repair the installation but while it was repairing - my computer blue screened (probably unrelated to installation I was running a lot of programs). Now, whenever I try to install VS 2017 - it instantly gives me this error log and says 'Setup operation failed'. What do I do to fix this?

Error log:


  [29cc:0004][2016-12-22T07:39:53] Error 0x80004003:

I tried posting on VS developer community but it is instantly marked as duplicated and linked to other duplicates which link to other duplicates which have no solution.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Refer to the error message, you can try to remove the existing VS 2017 RC that install failed before as below:


Go to Control Panel—Programs and Features, if there has ‘Microsoft Visual Studio 2017’, right click it and choose ‘Uninstall’
Try to delete the following installed folders: (you can back up those folders before any modification, in case we need to roll back)


•   Go to the folder: %ProgramData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio and delete the ‘Packages’ folder and ‘Setup’ folder if there has. 

•   Go to the Visual Studio installation folder (normally under %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio) and delete the folder ‘2017’

After that, make sure windows update is up-to-date, clean up the %temp% folder and temporarily disable any antivirus software, reboot the computer and re-run the VS 2017 RC installer as administrator again.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
A common problem is that when you go to the downloads page it automatically downloads the x64 version of VS. So, create a Dev account (free) then go to downloads from the dev homepage and select the version you want to download and check x86. Hope this helps!
    
    
Title: Is it possible to program on Windows RT
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there any way to install a C++ compiler or Ruby/Python interpreter on WinRT. (or is there any other way to program in a language beside JavaScript and beside online compilers and IDEs)

To be more specific: Can I program USING MY WinRT NOT FOR WinRT. SO can I open an app or notepad ON WinRT and than compile the code ON WinRT (NOT "FOR" but "using"). Thx.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You're looking for an IDE (integrated development environment) that would run on Windows RT (ARM based) devices and allow you to compile programs for other target platforms? While there're no technical restrictions for such an app, there don't seem to be any in the store at the moment. The only one to feature a Ruby interpreter seems to be InstantRuby, though it doesn't look like you could actually create a program with it.

There are multiple code editors already available though (in no particular order as I haven't tried any of them yet):


Code Writer
NotepadRT
HaxPad
CodePlus

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The easiest way would be use a remote desktop app on the WindowsRT computer. Install the IDE or other development tools on a regular PC, and use remote desktop to login. In this way, the WindowsRT system acts as a terminal ("thin client"), and can support about any IDE and compiler chain that you can install on the PC.

If you really want to build software on WindowsRT: if this was possible, it would most likely involve developing for WindowsRT, since at least if you want to do local debugging, your code will have to run on WindowsRT also.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Yes, but you need to jailbreak the device. Python 2.7.3 has been ported to WinRT (calls to native code wont work). Vim along with a few other editors have also been ported. See here for more information on the jailbreak http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092158 and on the ported apps http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092348

Title: In Unity3D is it possible to keep the Scene view focused when hitting Play?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Unity3D, when you hit play, by default, it switches to the full 'Game' view which is great for previewing and such, but sometimes we just want to see our results in the 'Scene' view since we don't have to worry about setting up all the lighting, materials, etc.

Now we know we can simply create a new layout that shows both the 'Game' and the 'Scene' tabs at the same time, and that's what we're doing so we can continue to look at the 'Scene' tab when we start.  However, we just don't want to see the 'Game' tab at all.  Love to just hide it until we need it later.

Can this be done?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The game scene can't be closed while running the game. But I found a little workaround: You can detach the Game view into a separate window make it as small as possible and position it near the play button like this:

Now after you hit the play button just click into the empty area left from the play button as soon as the game view gets the focus. It's faster than running with your mouse to the tabs. On the other side if you are a keyboard junkie like me hit CMD+P, CMD+&lt; on Mac or the equivalent on Windows.

Is there any way, with the Eclipse IDE, to have a "master" folder containing several related projects?

The reason I want this is because I have several Maven webapps.  With Maven it is convention to have a "master" project which builds all the dependent projects.  Without the ability to logically group these projects in Eclipse my project structure looks something like this:

--master-proj1
--proj1-core
--proj1-dep
--master-proj2
--proj2-core
--proj2-dep


And of course these will be sorted alphabetically making it even worse.  I'd rather have a couple folder where I can store each project:

--project1
  --master

Title: Common Lisp IDE for C# Developer?
Description: 
    
    
                    
UPDATE 

I've decided to go with Clojure for now.  

LispDev isn't ready, and Eclipse/cusp wasn't stable enough for me to feel comfortable.

As for Clojure, after a long, very frustrating, very annoying process trying to get Eclipse/CCW, Netbeans/Enclojure and IntelliJ/La Clojure working, I finally got Eclipse/CCW working.  The rest are still in mostly-broken states.  

(If I get around to it, I'll document what it took for me to get Eclipse/CCW working.)

So for now, I'm going to use that.  I may dip back into CL, and check out LispWorks and AllegroLisp's free versions, but Clojure feels like a more natural step for me from working within the Microsoft CLR environment.

Thanks everyone for the help.



Original Question

I'm a C# developer very familiar with Visual Studio (with Resharper).

I'm new to Lisps.  I've taken an interest in both Common Lisp and Clojure recently, and found plenty of good material on both of them.

I've tried Emacs + Slime, but it feels like a very backwards, dated solution.  I have no doubts about its power, but it's usability is nothing like what I'm used to.  I don't want to struggle with an IDE in addition to the language.

There are Eclipse plugins for both Clojure and CL.  There's also a couple more options I've seen for Clojure.  Since I'm not a Java dev, I know nothing about these IDEs.

Is Eclipse a good place to start?  Are there other good options?

EDIT: 

Here's the features I'm used to:


Syntax highlighting and autoindentation (everyone has this, so it's a moot point)
Autocomplete of functions and variable names
Realtime displays of all function overloads and parameters and the ability to arrow up/down through the list while typing in parameters
Syntax suggestions for code improvement, with the ability to do them for you ("use a const", "convert to LINQ expression (FP)", "variable will never be assigned to", "variable will never be used", "variable could be null", "function will never be used", etc.)
Extract Method/Function refactoring: select a block of text, and it can be extracted into a new function
Create Variable Refactoring: select a block of text and create a variable (e.g., a let)
Rename Refactoring: rename a function or variable declaration and all other functions using it will be updated (automated search/replace)
Go to Definition of a method/function, variable
Find Usages/References to a particular method/function, variable
Integrated folder-based project management tools and build tools
"Move class to new file" which creates a new file based on the class name, and containing all of its methods
"Rename file based on class type" which renames the file if you change the class name
F9/Click to the left of the line to add/remove breakpoints
F10/F11 to step into or over code when debugging, along with an arrow and highlighting to show which code is currently executing (step into a func execution, or just execute it here)


Most everything is available in a right-click context menu, or as a hovering combobox or textbox as you're typing.

I'm not saying emacs/slime can't do that, but if it does, it doesn't use anything similar in terms of usability techniques.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you're used to Visual Studio and want a similar product for Lisp, the equivalent is probably going to be a similar commercial IDE.  The big ones I know of are Allegro and Lispworks.

I've not personally used either one for real work (i.e., a big project), though I've tried demos.  They seemed nice enough, if a bit complex and with weird UIs, but not so much better than Slime to be worth the money to me.  But if you want something like VS, they may be just what you're looking for.

FWIW, I do both C# and Common Lisp in Emacs, and I find Slime to be 10 times better than any set of modes I've found for editing C# so far.  Come to think of it, I don't know of any development environment for any language or platform I'd rather use -- it's that good.

One issue you may have is that Lisp itself is a different enough language than what you're used to that old ways of doing things no longer apply, so any IDE may seem "backwards" to you.  (I learned Lisp long before C#, and C# seems backwards and dated to me!)  So instead of learning a few Slime commands (there's not many you really need), you're learning IDE commands, which might not really be any easier for you, since the concepts are the same and don't necessarily map to VS-like IDE features.

But good luck with whatever you choose!
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
C# is mostly used in a batch mode. The IDE shows this. It knows the syntax of a fixed language, invokes a compiler and uses the output from various tools, like the compiler.

Common Lisp is slightly different. The IDEs are either integrated into Common Lisp (Allegro CL, LispWorks, CCL) or are in something like Emacs and connect to a running Lisp (SLIME / Emacs). The major mode of development is interactive. A program is running and the IDE modifies it.

For Emacs one uses SLIME with the extensions Paredit and Redshank. See: Editing Lisp Code with Emacs.


Syntax highlighting and autoindentation (everyone has this, so it's a moot point)

This is provided by the IDEs.
Autocomplete of functions and variable names

This is provided by the IDEs.
Realtime displays of all function overloads and parameters and the ability to arrow up/down through the list while typing in parameters

Common Lisp does not have 'overloads'. It is possible to browse generic functions (CLOS) in IDEs.
Syntax suggestions for code improvement, with the ability to do them for you ("use a const", "convert to LINQ expression (FP)", "variable will never be assigned to", "variable will never be used", "variable could be null", "function will never be used", etc.)

Lisp compilers output hints and warnings. There are also style suggestions by some.

Maybe you should give Jabberwocky a try. 

There's also LispIDE, and Lisp Studio.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Allegro Common Lisp has an IDE supplied with it which may be of interest (although I'm not sure if you can use it with other Lisps). The Eclipse plugin is called Cusp and can be found here, although there's a fork of it here called lispdev which may have been updated more recently.

There may be some useful stuff over at the Lisp Game Wiki, especially the Useful Applications page here.

Personally I like using Emacs+Slime with some of the emacs tools which are designed to make it more IDE like.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
If you are new to Lisp and not an emacs user presently, then I would strongly recommend the free editions of either Allegro Lisp or LispWorks. Or, if you are going the Scheme route, PLT Scheme (which is now called Racket). 

All three have very feature rich IDE's. Calling trees, type ahead, in-editor breakpoints, and most of the things you are used to from traditional IDE's.   
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I know this is an old question but - for Clojure - how about Nightcode?  I similarly didn't want to waste language-learning time learning a new editor (i.e. Emacs/SLIME) too.  I found Nightcode very usable.

https://nightcode.info/

I find myself now wanting Nightcode to support Common Lisp (maybe in the form of ABCL) too!
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
While this question is old, and the OP has turned to Clojure, I think this is still a valid question, especially for those looking to learn Common Lisp and are either reluctant to switch from Visual Studio or just want to learn something new with a tool they are familiar with, to at least reduce the barrier to entry into such a great language, the same reasons why this question was asked.

I wrote an article explaining exactly how to achieve this, using Visual Studio as a Lisp IDE, which would be an almost great substitution for EMACS + SLIME combination.

The steps to achieve this setup are:


Visual Studio 2015 (Obviously the main ingredient)
Lisp Integration Visual Studio Extension.
Have ConEmu already installed and grab the ConEmuIntegration Visual Studio Extension.
A Common Lisp implementation of your choice, set in your %PATH% (via Environment Settings)


With that setup above, you will have an embedded REPL, and hovering the mouse over the Lisp functions/macros will give you tooltips with the signatures and definitions. This should accomplish most of the features requested in the original question.

It may have been unfortunate that at the time this question was asked, these tools weren't mature enough/created to be fully integrated as it is now, OR no one was aware or interested enough at the time.

As a bonus, if you are already familiar with C++, my recommendation would be to check out Embeddable Common Lisp (ECL), as that allows you to embed Lisp into your C++ code or call C++ from Lisp, how great is that combined with Visual Studio?

I have never done any Windows coding and I would like to give it a try. To create a simple application e.g. a window that displays a plain "Hello World" message.

What IDE (open source?) would I need to start of with and what language is used for the native Windows applications?

This is not for professional use, just for an amateur.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'd recommend going for Visual Studio Express, you can use c#, Visual Basic (VB.NET) or c++, it's free and easy. It also makes the step to the larger Visual Studio simple if you're ever going to do that.

check out Microsoft Visual Studio Express

edit: added VB.NET

Since i'm editing anyway, how about some additions; If you prefer opensource you could also look into SharpDevelop (c# and boo) and/or monodevelop (c#, but better for linux/multiplatform, not so great for just windows imho but yout mileage may vary)

edit: 6 years later.

Microsoft has, in the mean time, provided us with Visual Studio Community Edition, which is in essence a complete Visual Studio professional, but free (some restrictions do apply). I do believe this is now the absolute best way to develop most non commercial, and possibly some commercial, Windows oriented projects you can get.

notepad + .NET Framework + cmd

type:

using System.Windows.Forms;
public class HelloWorld
{
     public static void Main()
     {
        MessageBox.Show("Hello, World!");
      }
}


save as %WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\vX.X.XXXXX\hello.cs

open command line


  cd %WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\vX.X.XXXXX 
  %homedrive%


compile:


  csc /target:winexe hello.cs


run:

If you're looking for open source IDE I recommend Eclipse with plugins or MonoDevelop (wikipedia).
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
There are a lot of IDEs out there, if you want to develop for windows I'd recommend .net and the free "express" series of Microsoft tools.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Try either AutoIt or AutoHotkey. I personally recommend AutoHotkey.

For LOTS of sample (and useful!) scripts, visit this page: http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Skrommel/
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
You could look into VBScript, using notepad to edit the code. It is quite simple to program with, and there are a lot of examples.

Hello World would be done by placing the following into a file called HelloWorld.vbs and double clicking it from an explorer window.

MsgBox("Hello World")


A message box with hello world will then display.

There is wxDev-Cpp IDE (google for it). It's great for small apps. It's based on wxWidgets, so you also get portability for free.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
If you're looking for Open Source and cross platform compatibility I would look at Eclipse.  However if you simply want "free" I would also look at IntelliJ IDE which is designed for JAVA development and is also cross platform but not Open Source.  They offer some free licensed versions.

If you're new to gui programming, Shoes is a fun way to pick up some of the concepts as well as learn some ruby along the way. It's primarily a learning tool however, so you'll need to eventually pick up Visual Studio (or something similar) when you're ready to develop a functional windows app.



Edit: I see you've done some programming in linux from one of your comments, so this might be a bit too rudimentary for you. For anyone new to programming and wanting to try their hand at a windows program, Shoes is worth looking at. The free version of Visual Studio is definitely what you'll want to check out, or alternatively you could continue to work in Eclipse on windows, as you're already familiar with it.
    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
You don't have to use an IDE to create a Hello World gui application. 

Libraries like Qt, wxWidgets, GTK+, etc, allow you to write such programs, and their tutorials usually have some sample "hello word" programs.

UPDATE

I believe most GUI libraries (try to) maintain platform native look and feel; or at least that's what the docs say. 
    
    
Title: Selenium IDE select2 selecting an item
Description: 
    
    
                    
Pretty new to selenium IDE.

I've been trying to get this to work but I have some issues with select2.
I've looked into other issues like:Selenium IDE-Automating Select2 Search Box 
etc..

What I have so far is:

clickAt | css=.select2-choice |
sendKeys | css=#select2-drop input.select2-input | Adobe
clickAt | css=.select2-result-label:contains('Adobe') |


It opens the select2, types ' Adobe ' and filters, but it won't click on the result it finds.
Any ideas/suggestions?

Kind regards
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
clickAt | css=.select2-choice |
sendKeys | css=#select2-drop input.select2-input | Adobe
pause | 1000
clickAt | css=.select2-result-label:contains('Adobe') |


This fixed it, putting a pause in the middle. It went to fast, if you put Selenium on ' Slow mode ' it went fine, just on fast it sweeped over it.

I think is better  without "pause" (performance)

Title: How to define a keyboard shortcut for building the default project in VC++ IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
The Visual Studio for C++ defines a keyboard shortcut F7 for building the whole solution. However, it doesn't define a keyboard shortcut for building the default project.

Usually, a solution contains many projects and one of the projects is defaulted. If I modified some code in the default project and want to build it, I must use the mouse to right-click the project name, and select the 'build' menu. It's slow and tedious.

Is there a way to define a keyboard shortcut such as F4 for building the default project?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You don't specify which version of Visual Studio you have, but in VS2012, you can certainly create a keyboard shortcut to build the current project.

Choose Tools/Options from the menu, and then select Keyboard from the Environment section and locate the required action to assign whatever keyboard shortcut you like:



Just click in the Press shortcut keys box and press the key combination you require.

Having said that, it's normal for a Solution to contain related Projects, and for some or all of these projects to have dependencies, for example a static lib and a consuming executable. As long as all the other projects in the solution are already built, pressing F7 to build the solution will only build what is necessary based on what you have changed. So there should be little overhead in doing so.

If your solution has grouped projects for a different reason (e.g. as part of a larger build), you can always create a separate solution that just contains a single project and then use F7 without having to make a keyboard shortcut.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
In VS2013, I needed to use the Command Build.BuildSelection instead of Build.BuildOnlyProject.


    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
In VS 2013, in the BUILD menu, you should see the Build Selection section after the Build Solution section. You will see that Shift+F6 is already assigned to Build ErrorHandler, the default project.



You can also add the Build toolbar. The first button on it should be the Build Selection button.

The basic variant would be AutoPairs. The same effect but a little more sophisticated can also be achieved with YASnippet.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you type M-(, that will insert both a ( and a ), and leave point in between; if you then type M-), that will move point across the closing ).  I use this all the time.

There is also a mode called "paredit" (available from http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.el) which does this sort of thing for quotes as well, and probably other stuff.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Paredit-mode inserts matching closing elements by default, so the while typing you'll see something like printf() then printf("") and the cursor would be positioned inside quotes.
