Title: Is it possible to set different colours for different types of comments in PhpStorm?

Is it possible to set one colour for // comments and another for # in PhpStorm IDE?

I would like to use # comments for short descriptions on how the code works or for indicating some sections in classes (like # Accessors, # Calculations etc followed by adequate methods) and // for temporary comments. For this it would be extremely helpful to have different colours.

I don't think this is possible with default PhpStorm setup (hope I am wrong), but maybe is there an plugin for such thing?

Title: How to see exception info while debugging without declaring &ldquo;ex&rdquo; variable
Description: 
    
    
                    
While debugging, I've always been able to see information about the exception once a catch block was entered even if my catch just looked like this:

catch 
{
}


Since updating to Visual Studio 2017 though, I am only able to get exception information if I've actually declared a variable like so:

catch (Exception ex)
{
}


This is super annoying because there are a number of places where the exception is not declared (and normally does not need to be) but I do need to see what the exception is while debugging if there is one. How can I get the behavior back where it always shows me about the exception regardless of whether I've declared a variable for it or not?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In the locals window you should see a pseudo variable $exception that has the exception object for you to inspect. You can also add a watch expression for $exception in any of the watch windows.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Can Pycharm  autocomplete the left side of an assignment operator like eclipse can with ctrl+shift+L?

Assume I have a function such as :

def file_list(self, pattern=None):
    ...
    return matching_filenames


I enter/auto complete the following code snippet elsewhere to use that function:

self.file_list(pattern)


Can PyCharm auto complete to something like:

matching_filenames= self.file_list(pattern)  // or even
file_list = self.file_list(pattern)


How? 

I cannot find anything in the PyCharm docs at:

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/auto-completing-code.html
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/mastering-keyboard-shortcuts.html

I know that Eclipse can do this, can PyCharm?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes, it can. 
the default option should be:


select self.file_list(pattern) (mark it)
hit Ctrl + Alt + V
it should add a new variable to your code.

side note: there are a lot of useful shortcuts and something called live templates. i recommend reading on both since they help you write code faster and you will look cooler doing so.
    
    
Title: Formatting HTML with Nunjucks extension installed
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have some Angular component HTML some.component.html that I'm trying to format.  When I hit ctrl-shiftp, and selectFormat Document` I get the message:


  There is no document formatter for 'nunjucks'-files installed.


So it seems VSCode thinks that the .html file is a nunjucks file.

Is there a way to make it think that it's a html file? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can switch back to HTML by clicking on the word "Nunjucks" in VS Code's status bar. This "Language Indicator" is near the bottom-right of VS Code's window.  Clicking it will display a "Select Language Mode" drop-down-list where you can select "HTML".

After that, things that normally work for HTML files (like Format Document) will work again; however, things like the special syntax highlighting applied to Nunjuck files will not, but you can switch back and forth as needed.

Here's VS Code's documentation for Changing the language for the selected file.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Explicitly adding a "file.associations" in settings.json seems to solve the need to switch back-and-forth. 

"files.associations": {
    "*.html": "html",

Title: How can I quickly start typing SQL in Microsoft Access?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Microsoft Access 2016, I would like to click somewhere and start typing SQL of new query right away. But the shortest way to start typing SQL (which I found so far) is:


Select menu Create strong/strong/lilistrong/strongstrong/strong/lili/lili/li/olp/ppkbd/kbdkbd/kbdkbd/kbdkbd/kbdkbd/kbd/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
The function below creates or alters a simple placeholder query, opens it in Design View, switches to SQL View with its text highlighted, and then deletes the text. 

Use the function as the RunCode action of a macro and add the macro to the Quick Access Toolbar.  Then you can click that icon and start typing your SQL.

Public Function NewQuery()
    Const cstrQueryName As String = "USysQuery0"
    Dim db As DAO.Database
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    Dim strSql As String

    strSql = "SELECT Date() AS Today;"

    Set db = CurrentDb
    For Each qdf In db.QueryDefs
        If qdf.Name = cstrQueryName Then
            Exit For
        End If
    Next
    If qdf Is Nothing Then
        Set qdf = db.CreateQueryDef(cstrQueryName)
    End If
    qdf.SQL = strSql
    qdf.Close
    DoCmd.OpenQuery cstrQueryName, acViewDesign
    DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdSQLView
    DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdDelete
End Function

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Option 1: deal with it.

By default, Access doesn't support anything faster than this. 

Option 2: create a macro in your Access database to automate the task, and bind this to a key combination

You could write a macro to automate command bar actions, and bind that macro to a shortcut. I currently don't have time to look up the required commands but am certain it's possible.

Option 3: buy a plugin

There are plugins out there that immediately go to SQL view, support having the SQL and results on the same pane, have syntax highlighting, etc.

An example of such a plugin is Access SQL editor (I'm not affiliated in any way)

Option 4: Create your own.

Writing your own SQL editor that's better than what Access offers by default is very simple, because Access offers very little by default.

You can start off with a form with a textbox that takes the SQL, a save button, an execute button (requires a little VBA), and a subform that displays the query results. Then you already have something that allows you to open it and start typing right away.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
While waiting for better answer, I created an AutoHotKey solution â€“ a keyboard shortcut (restricted only to Access) to perform the above steps in English language version of Microsoft Access 2016:

 

SendMode Input                                      ; // Choose mode of sending keystrokes

#IfWinActive, ahk_class OMain ahk_exe MSACCESS.EXE  ; // Only in scope of MS Access app

+^n::                                               ; // Routine for Ctrl+Shift+N starts
    Send !cqd                                       ; // Run "Query Design" menu command
    WinWaitActive,Show Table ahk_class #32770       ; // Wait for "Show Table" window
    Send {Esc}!jqwq{End}{Left}{Space}               ; // Send the rest of the keys
    Return

#IfWinActive                                        ; // end of #IfWinActive section


After pressing Ctrl+Shift+N and waiting a bit*, a new query window is open in SQL view and I can start typing SQL.

*) Sometimes, MS Access can be really slow on keyboard shortcuts accessing the ribbon and on switching from query Design View to SQL View.

Question: Where I have all the public fields ?!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In a debug session, PyCharm has access to the instance of an object, and can inspect and see exactly which attributes it has. When you're editing the code, PyCharm does not run anything, and can only analyze the code statically. Its capabilities to do so are limited by Python's lack of type declarations, so it's perfectly normal that it does not display all available members.

To make PyCharm's intellisense work better, you can add type hints to your code, as described in the documentation.

This variable is not used and javac compiler optimizes the bytecode by completely removing it. You can add some usage for the variable, like log it so System.out and then you should be able to see it in the debugger.

I have several folders in my project as the sample structure below.

parent-directory

 | sub-directory-2
 | sub-directory-3
 | ....
 | sub-directory-n


While searching for a string in all the files in the parent-directory using Atom editor, it takes a lot of time to fetch the results. 

But if the search is limited to a particular folder like 'parent-directory/sub-directory-n' the search time gets reduced considerably.

Now the challenge is that I'm unable to search inside specific folders at once. I tried all the different combinations below, but nothing seems to be working fine.

parent-directory/sub-directory-1;parent-directory/sub-directory-2
parent-directory/sub-directory-1+parent-directory/sub-directory-2

Buffer:



Buffer list:


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

Once a buffer is added to the buffer list its index can not be changed.
Once an index has been used it is unusable for other buffers.
It is impossible to specify the index at which you want to add a buffer to the buffer list.
It is impossible to swap two buffers.
It is impossible to nudge the buffers in the buffer list.


So no, you can not.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I think you can use the arglist instead of bufflist, the arglist is a subset of bufflist. There is a vimcast about it.

Basically you can creat a file with the correct order of your files and do:

I have a CMake (mostly C, with some C++) project whose installation instructions are as follows:

Depending on what you need to run you can select different configuration types.

For the one in your picture, Run Kind Directory is selected and that means the IDE will run the tests in the directory you point it at and since the working directory is in the same directory, it will run ./... as that's what it means.

For the Run Kind Package, it will run only the specified package and no other packages, so no /... appended to it.

For the Run Kind File it will run the tests in a single file. 

The pattern that you've added, ./svc tells the go tool how to match test names. There you should put valid patterns for test names. If you want to control for which directory / package the tests are run you can use a different run configuration per directory / package since multiple configurations are possible.

Based on your reply you want to run the tests in your whole projects, recursive, without the vendor folder. To do so, create a Run Kind Directory, as you have one already, and make sure sure you are using Go 1.9 as it will automatically ignore the vendor directory when using ./... matching.

Please let me know if you need further details.
    
    
Title: WebStorm PhpStorm: how to skip specific extensions from indexing
Description: 
    
    
                    
WebStorm / PhpStorm IDEs allow the user to mark certain directories as "excluded", so that they will not be indexed and the classes contained will not show up in autocomplete etc... (see here)

Is it possible to mark specific extensions as excluded.  All my components have a pair of files such as:

my.component.ts  &lt;-- actual component
my.component.spec.ts &lt;-- for testing only


I've seen this doc about how to exclude an individual file, but that doesn't scale well. I would like all the .spec.ts files to be ignored by the indexer because they pollute a lot of the autocomplete UI and slow down my work.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Since WebStorm/PhpStorm 2017.2 it will be possible to exclude files by pattern - see  IDEA-127753.
Note also that you can use Ignore files and folders option to exclude certain files by name ( see https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-127753#comment=27-868409 )
    
    
Title: PhpStorm &ldquo;Save as&rdquo; open new file
Description: 
    
    
                    
This always catches me out, but it appears to be another PhpStorm only quirk. Normally when you "Save as" a document, it will open the new file. This happens in all Adobe products, all Office products, and every other app I can think of... except PhpStorm.

So many times I've forgotten about this quirk and started working over the old file, thinking it was the new one. It's most frustrating.

Is there a way to change this behaviour?

  Is there a way to change this behaviour?


Unfortunately no.

Save as is basically a shortcut for Save and then Refactor | Copy.

https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-332 I guess (based on "duplicate" tickets)



General suggestions (Captain Obvious):


Invoke Refactor | Copy on desired file before making changes in it (so it will sit deep in your mind that the currently edited file will keep changes)
Use Local History to rollback unwanted changes in old/original file.

    
    
Title: Can I force the console to keep both price and tiprate on the same line?
Description: 
    
    
                    
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Tipping {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Please enter initial price followed by tip percentage: ");
    double Price = s.nextDouble(); double TipRate = s.nextDouble();
    double TipAmount;
    TipAmount = (Price*TipRate)/100;
    System.out.println("Tip amount: " + TipAmount);
    System.out.print("Total price: " + (TipAmount + Price) +".");
  }}


I always get the price on the first line and the tiprate on the other.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Judging by your wording, you don't like that when input is handled via the Scanner, pressing Enter on the first double value (The Price) it advances to the next line and waits for the second double value (The TipRate). First of all, the character "Enter" is essentially the system dependent new-line character, so the Scanner immediately splits the input when the enter key is pressed. Specifically, the Scanner uses the Character.isWhiteSpace(char ch); function to evaluate where to split the tokens. 

It all depends on how you want your input handled. Sadly, without importing a Curses-esque library and using a custom command prompt, the "\n" character cannot be reversed. What you can do is write your input and separate it by a space, for example writing "23.4 12.3" will write the input in the same line and correctly break the line into the 2 tokens you want. 

If it is purely for aesthetic reasons you could catch the token as a String, evaluate if the "\n" character exists within and ask the user to re-input the variables in a single line or, if the "\n" character doesn't exist, split the String on the " " character and then use the Double.valueOf(String str); function. 

Beware not to use the (Scanner in).setDelimiter(String str) since that will avoid breaking the tokens on the "\n" character (If the str String is for example " ") and will only freeze your program until the user splits 2 inputs with the space character and then throw an InputMismatchException because 12.3\n12.3 32.3 would be "valid" input but the token "12.3\n12.3" can't be evaluated to a single Double variable.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Sure, avoid calling:

System.out.println()


As the name (somehow) indicates, that prints a whole "line"; ending with a line break.

So, either call System.out.print() multiple times; or better practice: call System.out.println() once, but give all the strings you wanted to be printed to that call.

And as I just saw your comment: you are calling println() - in the line before you call print()!

Given your comment: you have to understand how that scanner works. The scanner reads strings; and by default, line by line.

In other words: when you use nextDouble() then the scanner assumes that you will enter a string that represents a number - but that your input is "terminated" by the user pressing ENTER. In other words; those line breaks are inevitable! 

So, simply deal with them like:

System.out.print("Please enter initial price: ");
double Price = s.nextDouble(); 
System.out.print("Please enter tip percentage: ");
double TipRate = s.nextDouble();

double TipAmount = (Price*TipRate)/100;
System.out.println("Tip amount: " + TipAmount + " results in Total price: " + (TipAmount + Price) +".");


Long story short: when using the console in/out like this; you can't prevent certain line breaks. Simply accept that, and don't get to much into perfectionism.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Use instead of System.out.println (which stands for print line) with System.out.print. The System.out.println will print an line break after the given string on the output stream.

You could also combine the print's with a single print line.

For example you could use this:

System.out.println(String.format("Tip amount: %f Total Price: %f", TipAmount, (TipAmount + Price)));


Update

Simple solution for the scanner problem would be to input the numbers in one line separated with a whitespace.

My version is the latest CCS7.1.0.00016_linux-x64
What is wrong with the installer?
Are there better  alternatives?
thanks in advance

I also experienced this hanging. On my system (Archlinux) I identified glibc-2.25 to be the cause of the problem. Downgrading to glibc-2.24 solved this issue.

Title: WebStorm &ldquo;Before Launch&rdquo; â€“&#160;Wait for completion
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am trying to set up this (more than slightly ridiculous) stack:


Bundler: Webpack
Library: ReactJS
Language: TypeScript + JSX (tsx)
IDE: WebStorm


Now, this was all working fine, until I realized that my app wasn't being compiled by WebStorm unless I manually ran the webpack command before running the app.

What I tried next was editing my Run/Debug Configuration (JavaScript Debug) to run webpack as an External Tool "Before Launch". Note the "Before".

This was all working fine, too, until I then realized that WebStorm was asynchronously starting webpack and running the app immediately after starting, meaning that none of the changes since the last compile were saved (since webpack didn't have time to finish compiling before the app was run)!

"Simple", thought my naÃ¯ve self, "all I must do is toggle the 'Wait For Completion' checkbox, which surely must exist!" But as is always the case, that was not the case. I could find no such checkbox.

~30 minutes and a few brain cells later, here I am. Now, the question is:

How do I get my Webpack application to be compiled before it is run in WebStorm?



What I have tried so far:


Adding the webpack command to the "Before launch" section of my Run/Debug configuration. As described above, WebStorm does not wait for it to complete before running the app, causing the previous version to be run instead.
Configuring a NPM build script to simply run webpack, then adding that to the "Before launch" section. Same problem. Now I'm starting to wonder if anything in the "Before launch" section is run synchronously...


What I have not tried so far (and why):


Creating a custom NPM run script that runs webpack then starts the debugger. This is far from ideal because (as far as I know) it would be extremely difficult to make this work with the WebStorm debugger.
Manually running webpack each time before debugging. Well, I have tried it and it works; but I hope it's pretty clear why this is not a good long-term solution.
Manually including each script in my HTML. As the app grows, I may have many more scripts, and I am not looking forward to adding each one manually to HTML just so I can debug them easier.


I am open to any solutions, including those suggesting alternatives to Webpack (but any alternatives to WebStorm, ReactJS, or Typescript must be REALLY good because I have already put a lot of thought into picking those).
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It's a known issue, please follow WEB-21022 for updates. Problem is not specific to webpack, and the only workaround is running webpack manually (via run configuration or external tool) before starting the app. Note that I can't recreate it when debugging, only when running the application
    
    
Title: Will a C program compile in a C++ workspace?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm new to C/C++ and I have just downloaded the CodeLite IDE (any other suggestions for free ones would be welcome). 
I intend to write a C program, but it only gives me an option to create a C++ workspace. Can I write my C in this workspace all the same?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It depends on your IDE, your compiler (which is invoked by IDEs to compile code, and usually [not always] not a part of the IDE), and the type of code you write.

Practically, quite a few C++ compilers have a "C mode" - for example, command line switches or other settings that may be configurable through your IDE - to compile as C.   You'll need to read your compiler and IDE documentation.   Bear in mind that some compilers, even in C mode, support C++ features that are not valid in C (and that the reverse is also true).

It also depends on what sort of C code you intend to write, and how well you know the features of C that are not part of C++, and vice versa.  

But, yes, as a general rule you can write a C program in a C++ workspace.   Just be aware of concerns like the above when doing so.

Also, don't be surprised when you proudly show some of your lovingly crafted code to a seasoned C or C++ developer, only to be informed you are writing a hybrid of C and C++.   Unfortunately, writing a hybrid of C and C++ is considered poor form by both C and C++ developers - mostly because the code is likely to work with some compilers and fail with others.     Too many compiler vendors intermix C and C++ in their documentation, and too much learning material (introductory texts, etc) does the same.    If writing C code in a (suitably configured) C++ environment, there is a fair chance your compiler won't complain about your code doing that.    This isn't a problem inherent to writing C in a C++ environment - too many vendors of C compilers support C++ features as an extension, and vice versa - but it is a phenomenon you are more likely to encounter if you write your C code in a C++ environment, unless you go out of your way to learn the differences between standard C and standard C++ independently of your compiler and compiler documentation.

I've lost track of the number of beginners who end up writing code that is some hybrid of C and C++  (e.g. using C++-specific features while believing they are writing C, or vice versa).   Only to have their code break when they build it with a different compiler (or, worse, an update of their compiler).

If you actually intend to write code that includes a mix of C and C++ (by which I mean pure C functions interfacing with pure C++ functions, not a hybrid like I mentioned above), you will need to allow orchestration of the build process - particularly linking - to be controlled by C++ settings, even if compilation settings for particular files mean they are compiled as C or C++.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Yes its possible. You must use your C++ compiler when compiling main() (e.g., for static initialization)
Your C++ compiler should direct the linking process (e.g., so it can get its special libraries)
Your C and C++ compilers probably need to come from the same vendor and have compatible versions (e.g., so they have the same calling conventions
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Non-trivial C programs will not compile as C++ code without modification â€” C is not a subset of C++.  See Where is C not a subset of C++?

Set compiler options to treat your code as C.

Code::Blocks and
for windows:

Title: Can Intellij open files for editing at the top/start, not the last edit position
Description: 
    
    
                    
If you open a big java file, scroll to 'somewhere' and make a change. Then close the file and re-open it, Intellij will open it at the last point that you made the change. This is annoying, can it be changed so it always opens the file at the top like most file reading applications do
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't really remember seeing such an option, but you can work around with some small tricks.

1) include line number of the file, eg to open MyUI at line 10: CTRL + N &amp; type myui:10



2) navigate to symbol, et to navigate to method init of MyUI: CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + N &amp; type myui.init


    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
This same misfeature annoyed me to the point of doing something about it, as I prefer to open files by double-clicking them in the Project tree (which doesn't present the option of typing in a line number).  Also, it bothers me to be typing in line numbers on every single file option simply to get the text editor to not jump to wherever I was editing six months ago.

Sadly, there's still no option to toggle this behavior.  (JetBrains really, really doesn't like it when users prefer simpler behavior than their flagship defaults.)  But it's very easy to strip the "last edited position" history out of the saved workspace.

Optional first step:  If you have more than one workspace, you need to find its configuration file.  Wherever you designated the project root location should contain a .idea subdirectory with a workspace.xml file, for example $HOME/IdeaProjects/MyProjectName/.idea/workspace.xml.  There will be a ProjectId key and some "nonsense looking" value, for example

&lt;component name="ProjectId" id="wZadhKS8vnOD4GBBT2Pz93rDw" /&gt;


You'll need that unique ID.

Actual steps:


Exit IDEA.  You can't do this while the IDE is running.
Go to your personal IDEA directory.  This can vary based on version; for me it is currently %HOME%/.IdeaIC2019.3.  It will have a config/workspace subdirectory containing an XML file for each of your workspaces, named after the ProjectId above.  For example,

$HOME/.IdeaIC2019.3/config/workspace/wZadhKS8vnOD4GBBT2Pz93rDw.xml


For 2020.1 and later, this location has moved; for me the default is now %APPDATA%/JetBrains/IdeaIC2020.1 and there is no config subdirectory, so:  C:/Users/me/AppData/Roaming/JetBrains/IdeaIC20201./workspace instead.

That XML file contains the saved last-edit positions in a node like this:

&lt;component name="editorHistoryManager"&gt;
this is all the stuff that causes annoyances
&lt;/component&gt;



Make a backup copy of the wZa...3rDw.xml file, whatever it's called for you.
Use your favorite programmatic XML editor tool to remove that node.  For example:

xmlstarlet ed --omit-decl -d '//component[@name="editorHistoryManager"]'  wZa...3rDw.xml &gt; tmp

mv  tmp  wZa...3rDw.xml
The next time IDEA is launched, all files will open at their beginning, the way God and nature intended.
For bonus points, automate the above in a script that runs behind the scenes as appropriate.  :-)


IDEA does something a little unusual with its XML involving whitespace, and tools like XMLStarlet often do something else.  As XML is whitespace agnostic this makes no difference at runtime, but it does mean that if you want to compare for correctness or  you're keeping the IDEA configuration in revision control, there will be a lot of extraneous "churn" in the diffs.  If this causes too much noise, you can augment step (4) to something like

xmlstarlet ....  |  sed -e 's@"/&gt;$@" /&gt;@'  &gt; tmp


to insert extra whitespace back, in most of the places where IDEA had originally put some.  (I didn't test this heavily, as the lack of whitespace isn't important to me or to the IDEA runtime.  It would have been nice to have a cleaner diff, but whatever.)

Caveats:  As IDEA can save its config in either a directory-based layout, or in a all-in-one-file layout, the steps to find the workspace config file may vary wildly.  What I wrote above works for the default directory-based layout.
    
    
Title: Pycharm search files with same name
Description: 
    
    
                    
When I double press Shift I can write a part of a filename and Pycharm suggests which files match. However in Django framework there a lot of files with the same name (e.g. views.py). Is there a way to search for a file by multiple words which match not only the filename but the path of the file?

For example if there are 2 apps - app1 and app2 and they both have views.py, and if I write "app views" then both files should be suggested. And if I write "app1 views" only the file from app1 should be suggested.

Is there such an action or a configuration option in Pycharm?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you just type app1/views.py or app2/views.py, only the correct views.py will be shown. It even works for partial matches - 1/iews.py will do a partial match and still show the correct thing.

I did not find the release number bringing this feature, but as of 2019.2.1 you can now edit and create custom Postfix Completion really easily in File | Settings | Editor | General | Postfix Completion.


  Note: to my knowledge, you cannot edit some built-in postfix templates (e.g.: !).


Source: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-postfix-completion.html
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Each postfix live template is implemented as a custom Java class that performs the necessary transformation of the expression in the editor. The only way to add your own postfix template is to write a plugin.

You can find implementations of postfix live templates for Java here.
    
    
Title: WebStorm formatter isn&#39;t good with TSLint
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am working with TypeScript in WebStorm for quiet a while, and recently I added TSLint to my setup in order to write better code. I successfully integrated it into the IDE (WebStorm 2016) but I have a bad experience with the IDE formatter combining the TSLint formatting rules.

For example I write:

let bar: foo;  // fine by tslint standarts 


And then I press Ctrl + Alt + L to format everything automatically and I get:

let bar:foo; // without space between the variable ":"
             // and its type the tslint complains


I haven't found any solution on the web and couldn't find a manual way to change this behaviour in the IDE.

  else if ( str == "strM" )
      decorator["strM"] =     &amp;Props::goodstrM;

  else if ( str == "strXXXL" ) decorator["strXXXL"] = &amp;Props::goodstrXXXL;


the nice block that is easily editable over multiple lines in the visual-block mode in vim:

if      ( str == "str"     ) decorator["str"    ] = &amp;Props::goodstr    ;
else if ( str == "strM"    ) decorator["strM"   ] = &amp;Props::goodstrM   ;

Answer 1: 

    
    
I know actually a tool that could help on aligning all that "ugly" block. It is called Align. All you have to do is give him the pattern that you would like to align. 

So for the above code you can do that:

:%normal! ggJ
:%s/;/;\r/g
:%left
:AlignCtrl =Clp1P1IW 
:% Align (\|)\|]\|[\|&amp;.\+ 
:% Align ;


As you can see from the 5th command you need manually reorganise the code by providing the pattern

Result:

if      ( str == "str"     ) decorator [ "str"     ] = &amp;Props::goodstr     ;   
else if ( str == "strM"    ) decorator [ "strM"    ] = &amp;Props::goodstrM    ;   
else if ( str == "strXL"   ) decorator [ "strXL"   ] = &amp;Props::goodstrXL   ;   
else if ( str == "strXXXL" ) decorator [ "strXXXL" ] = &amp;Props::goodstrXXXL ;

As @Dilettant pointed me to https://stackoverflow.com/a/34992894/1989141,
I realised there are two different places I was supposed to set the Python interpreter in PyCharm.

The first is in the main preferences (as in philâ€™s solution in the link) and allows me to specify a path to a local folder for mysqldb module. 
The second is in the edit configuration settings for the script I want to run. I noticed the interpreters were different. 

The script was set to run with the Python 2.7.6 /System/Library/Frameworks/...... version (which I believe is the OSx pre-installed version).
In the terminal and in PyCharm general settings I am using Python 2.7.9 in /usr/local/bin/python.

Matching the script interpreter to the one in the main settings (for which I manyally added mysqldb folder) solves the ImportError. Also I removed the environment variables I set up in the Edit Configuration as they are not needed.

Hope this helps. Thanks to both @Dilettant and @julivico for their suggestions.

If you want the code to be visible and executable, then you can't stop people from making changes to it.
You can however, stop them from saving those changes, by opening the workbook as read-only.
You can mark a workbook as read-only in the File Properties from within File Explorer. Or, if your workbook is opened via Automation, then you can specify read-only in the open method.

Answer 1: 

    
    
To reduce "New File" menu size, some of the bundled (default) similar file templates are grouped under the single menu entry which has drop down box where you can choose the particular kind of template to use. Examples of such grouped/gateway entries are: "HTML File", "Stylesheet", "JavaScript File", "PHP Class" etc.

In your particular case you need to use "Stylesheet" entry where you can choose "Less File":



Some notes: 


IDE will remember the "Kind" value that you have used when you use this dialog again.
There is no need to use mouse or keyboard to switch to the "Kind" filed at all -- just use Arrow Up/Down keys when typing file name -- they will switch the "Kind" directly from there.
If you create custom file template (e.g. "Less file 2") it will not be grouped/accessible via such dialog -- it will be listed as separate entry in "New" menu.

If anyone can help out here, it'd be much appreciated. TIA.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
We've done the same exercise long ago for SuiteScript 1.0, and I've just recently done it for our SuiteScript 2.0 set.

You can find the default templates inside of P2_POOL_HOME/plugins/com.netsuite.ide.core_2016.2.0.e4.jar/templates/ where P2_POOL_HOME is usually ~/.p2/pool/

The general format of templates.xml is:

&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;templates&gt;
        &lt;template label="TEXT YOU WANT IN DROPDOWN"
                defaultFilename="DEFAULT NAME FOR FILE"
                typesControl="radio|checkbox"
                headerFilename="PATH/TO/FILE/HEADER"
                startFilename="PATH/TO/START/FILE"
                endFilename="PATH/TO/END/FILE"
                rename="false"&gt;
            &lt;types&gt;
                &lt;files label="TEXT LABEL FOR CHECKBOX" bodyFilename="PATH/TO/FILE/WHEN/SELECTED" /&gt;
            &lt;/types&gt;
        &lt;/template&gt;
    &lt;/templates&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;


Here are two examples from our templates:

&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;templates&gt;
        &lt;template label="2.0 Portlet"
                defaultFilename="360CUSTOMER_PROJECT_PL_DESCRIPTION.js"
                typesControl="radio"
                headerFilename="header.ss2.js"

                endFilename="portlet_end.ss2.js"
                rename="false"&gt;
            &lt;types&gt;
                &lt;files label="Render" bodyFilename="portlet.ss2.js" /&gt;
            &lt;/types&gt;

For scripts that only have one entry point method (e.g. Suitelet, Portlet, Scheduled), you use radio for the typesControl setting and just have a single &lt;file&gt; tag under &lt;types&gt;. For those that have multiple entry points to choose from (e.g. Client, Map/Reduce, User Event), you use checkbox for the typesControl and then list each option that you want using &lt;file&gt; tags under &lt;types&gt;.

I do not actually know what the rename setting does.

The basic file structure of the generated file will be:

/* CONTENTS OF HEADER FILE */

/* CONTENTS OF START FILE */

/* CONTENTS OF ENTRY POINT 1 FILE */

/* CONTENTS OF ENTRY POINT 2 FILE */

/* ... */

/* CONTENTS OF ENTRY POINT N FILE */

/* CONTENTS OF END FILE */

I have tried the same thing using 2017. You will find some js and template files inside the jar file. I have modified the ss_2.0_suitelet.js and ss_header.js file.
Just pick those file from the jar and place in your own local library. Then modify. Dont forget to point the template directory in the preference-/pprecode/code/pre/div
Title: toggle form/unit view (F12 key) in RAD studio 2010
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a way to fix view-/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
I think you have changed the IDE setting Tools - Options - Environment Options - VCL Designer - Embedded Designer to be False. Probably to be able to see both the designer and code at the same time. In this state the designer view stays in front of the IDE and the F12 only toggles focus between the designer form and the IDE.

You don't really have to close the Designer view, you can also just minimize it.

If you revert the above setting (to enable Embedded Designer) the switch between Designer view and Code view happens as you wish with F12, but you will not be able to see both simultaneously.

Another option is to keep the present disabled Embedded Designer setting and open up a new edit view, with menu item View - New Edit view. In this case F12 toggles between the secondary code view and the form designer and also brings the focused window into front.

Thanks to @dummzeuch, there's also the possibility to change to "Classic undocked" desktop layout. You can change the desktop layout either by menu "View" - "Desktops" or by the dropdown in the toolbar.
    
    
Title: Increase size of PhpStorm error squiggly line (underwave)
Description: 
    
    
                    
Stupid tiny thing. 

PhpStorm is great but when I cut and paste code sometimes I leave off a ; or a } or sometimes I have another dumb problem. PS is good at finding these trouble is it uses a fine underwave which is quite difficult to see. I know all about F2 going to next error etc. I would just love to be able to make the error pointer more obvious so I can just look at the screen and see it - a bright red highlight over the missing character or whatever. (Spot the missing ; below.)



I have trawled SO and the rest of the Interweb and have spent ages in Settings but cannot find anyway to beef this up. Any ideas where the setting for this might be? 

EDIT: Just in case anyone comes this way again this is what a missing semicolon looks like now. Basically I never forget the closing semi colon or { as I have a great big red light shining in my face - perfect for a typing clutz like me.

Settings/Preferences | Editor | Colors &amp; Fonts

General | Errors &amp; Warnings

Choose the right style (e.g. Error or Warning) and change its settings.
You will not be able to make underwave bolder, but you can choose more brighter color (which may look a bit bolder to human eye) or change underwave to another style.


    
    
Title: PHPstorm scrolling with keyboard
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'am looking for an option to force scroll code when entering with keyboard cursor in example at 5 line from the end.

Default behavior is to scroll code when entering 1st or last visible line of code.

I would like to change it even for 10th from the beginning and 10th before last.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It appears the base IDE does not have an option for this. However, the behaviour is available in the IdeaVIM plugin (docs) under the scrolloff option.

'Scroll offset' mode can be enabled for the current session with the command:

:set scrolloffset=10


Add that to your ~/.ideavimrc to make it permanent.

NB: IdeaVIM changes the IDE to behave more like vim*, which may require some re-training. 



If you're not familiar with Vim:


Install the IdeaVIM plugin (via Settings â†’ Plugins â†’ Browse Repositores â†’ type 'ideavim' in search)
Restart the IDE
Open a file
Note the caret is a block like â–ˆ; this indicates 'normal' mode
Press : to enter the 'command' mode
Type set scrolloff=10 then Enter
Scroll around, notice the editor scrolls before the caret gets to the very top (or bottom)
Press i to enter 'insert' mode, and edit your file as usual
Press ESC to return to 'normal' mode

Title: Method refactoring in Eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
I try to do the following refactoring steps in Eclipse IDE (JDT) and can not find the required refactoring and can not remember the name of all of the steps. I checked the refactoring at SourceMacking and do not find the correct one.

Let's take for example the following scenario:



class A {

    method(B b) {
      doSomethingWithA();
      b.doSomethingWithB();
    }

    [...]
}

class B {
    [...]
}



1) Make method static (missing name of the refactoring?):

class A {

    static method(A a, B b) {
      a.doSomethingWithA();
      b.doSomethingWithB();
    }

    [...]
}

class B {
    [...]
}



2) Move method:

class A {
    [...]
}

class B {

    static method(A a, B b) {
      a.doSomethingWithA();
      b.doSomethingWithB();
    }

    [...]
}



3) Convert to instance method:

class A {
    [...]
}

class B {

    method(A a) {
      a.doSomethingWithA();
      doSomethingWithB();
    }

    [...]
}



So anyone knowing something to do this step by step in Eclipse or do know the name of the refactoring is welcome. The goal is to have IDE support for every step.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Unfortunately, Eclipse's refactoring functionality is not as complete as other IDEs (for example Jetbrains' IntelliJ). I'll include instructions on how to perform each of the refactorings you requested with both IntelliJ and Eclipse.

With IntelliJ


Make Method Static
Move Instance Method
Convert to Instance Method




With Eclipse


Make Method Static: Eclipse doesn't directly support it, but we can achieve this using two other refactorings.

1.1. Introduce Indirection



Result



public static void method(A a, B b) {
    a.method(b);
}

public void method(B b){
    doSomethingWithA();
    b.doSomethingWithB();
}


1.2. Inline



Result



public static void method(A a, B b) {
    a.doSomethingWithA();
    b.doSomethingWithB();
}

Move Static Members
Convert to Instance Method: Now, this is where it gets tricky. If you want to go from step 1 to step 3, you could just use Eclipse's Move Method and it'll handle everything perfectly fine. However, there are no ways that I know of to go from step 2 to step 3 using Eclipse's automated refactorings.

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
After having learned the refactoring is called 'Convert to Instance Method' I searched the bug database of Eclipse JDT and I found bad news:

Bug 10605
Bug 118032
Bug 338449

So basically it is a Won't-Fix noone cares feature request and so it might be time that I also switch to IntelliJ. I have to contemplate about this... . 

Emond Papegaaij suggested in the discussion of Bug 118032 a work around:


  A simple workaround is to create the static method, call this static method from the method you want to become static and inline the method call. This works for me in 4.3.1.


This is interesting but again would not be an automatic refactoring and defeat the purpose of refactoring in the first place. Adding someone's own code introduce the chance of failure and requires the rerun of the test-suite resulting in no chance of safely refactoring legacy code.
    
    
Title: Hide file extensions from tab labels in PhpStorm
Description: 
    
    
                    
I use PhpStorm for a project that has some very lengthy class names. As a result, not many files can fit in the tab bar above the editor before they get truncated and I have to go into the dropdown.

I was thinking, I could probably at least slightly decrease the impact of this issue if I could get PhpStorm to hide the extensions from the end of the file names (the icons in the tabs make them redundant anyway). Does anyone know a way to make PhpStorm do this? Any help is much appreciated!

Here's a screenshot, showing the tab bar I'm talking about (it's got a big red box around it), and showing what I want to change (I striked through the file extensions).

Title: Java - setVisible only works after clicking on screen
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a jframe with a jcheckbox and a jtextfield (it has many more components).

I set the label to setVisible(false) and when the checkbox is checked, it should turn the label visible. It actually does, but you just canÂ´t see it until you click anywhere else on the frame.

Here is some of the code:

jTextField17 = new javax.swing.JTextField();
jTextField17.setText("Quantas?");
jTextField17.setVisible(false);
jTextField17.setMinimumSize(new java.awt.Dimension(52, 20));


jCheckBox1 = new javax.swing.JCheckBox();
jCheckBox1.setBackground(new java.awt.Color(153, 255, 153));
jCheckBox1.setText("Cabecinhas");
jCheckBox1.addActionListener(new java.awt.event.ActionListener() {
   public void actionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {
    jCheckBox1ActionPerformed(evt);
   }
});


private void jCheckBox1ActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {                                           
    if (jCheckBox1.isSelected()){
        jTextField17.setVisible(true);
    }else{
        jTextField17.setVisible(false);
    }
}                                       


I donÂ´t think thereÂ´s anything wrong with the code.

To sum up:

user clicks checkbox. checkbox gets marked, nothing else seems to happen. user clicks anywhere on screen (after checking checkbox) and the textfield appears. 

IÂ´m using netbeans GUI editor. I would like to show the whole code, but itÂ´s 3000+ lines. If you need to see more, ask me what part you need and IÂ´ll edit here. Thanks for reading this and thank you even more for trying to help.

Title: Visual Studio 6.0 and Git (source control)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a project developed some years ago (in my company) with VS 6.0, and I want to make some changes. I have installed Visual Studio IDE (6.0), but I want - and I have - to control the source code of this project, with GIT, or another source version control.

Do you have any idea of how can I do this? or, Do you known a plugin for VS 6.0 and GIT (or another one)? Or should I control this code directly with the folder and Git Bash (command line)?

Any comment, suggestion, or advice is welcomed!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There's no built-in support for Git in VS 6.0 but you can use Git with it just fine. (You can use any source control system with any version of VS - it may not be integrated into the IDE but it'll work.)

If you prefer the Git command-line, use that. If you prefer using a GUI tool, one of them is SourceTree or TortoiseGit. I'm sure there are others, too.

As you're making changes in the project, when you're ready to commit things, just switch to the command-line (or the GUI tool) and perform the source-control operations you need. In Tools-/p/div
Answer 2: 

    
    
There is no support for Git in VS 6.0, I do not even think that Git was a "thing" when VS 6.0 was released.

Regards

Jose
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Git will not allow you to execute a pull that would cause you to lose changes in your working directory (this is good for obvious reasons).

Adding the file to your .gitignore will tell git not to push your changes to that file to other repositories, but it does not prevent you from pulling other repositories changes of those files. So this actually has no effect on the operation you are trying to do. As a side note, it is not recommended to put iml files in a .gitignore: What should be in my .gitignore for an Android Studio project?.

Here's what I would do:


Stash your local changes: git stash save "My iml changes"
Then checkout the code: git pull
Optionally, get your local changes out of the stash: git stash pop. Or, if you prefer, git stash drop stash@{0} (As pointed out by @LoyalRayne, you might not need these changes). See the differences with git stash show stash@{0}.

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you want the contents that are currently in the repo, you can revert your local changes first with git checkout blablabla.iml, then pull. Or, if you want to keep your local changes, do git stash, then git pull, then git apply. 

After doing the above steps, you may add the file to .gitignore. Make sure to remove it from source control as well with git rm --cached blablabla.iml. Note that when it is remove from source control, it will get deleted on other people's machines when they do their next git pull, so they will want to create a backup.

I have two examples:



As you can see PyDev marks Process in first example and PULL in second as "Undefined variable from import (...)". However, code is executed without any problems. It's just PyDev can't resolve those names.

Taking a closer look on multiprocessing and zmq modules I found that members that can't be recognized are imported in some weird way by updating globals.

Is there a way to make PyDev evaluate those import files more thoroughly?

There is KopiLuaDebug project that provides debugging capabilities for Lua scripts in Unity3d and integrates with ZeroBrane Studio IDE, although I'm not sure if it works with uLua. I've also seen posts on using ZeroBrane Studio to debug uLua, but don't have any further details.

Title: Android Studio - Deploys my app without new changes
Description: 
    
    
                    
My problem is basically that Android Studio wont deploy my app with my changes in the new code. Heres my case scenario:

I have a wifi direct code working like this (just testing with its methods):

    public void peerDiscovery(){

    mWifiDirectManager.discoverPeers(mChannel,

      new WifiP2pManager.ActionListener() {
        @Override
        public void onSuccess() {
             Log.v(TAG,"Discovery Peers Success");


        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(int reason) {
            Log.e(TAG,"Error on Discovery Peers, code: "+reason);


        }
     });
}


The above code works and then I decided to change it by adding the method: setPeerDiscoveryHandler(boolean isSuccess);

After the changes my code was as follows:

 public void peerDiscovery(){

    mWifiDirectManager.discoverPeers(mChannel,
      new WifiP2pManager.ActionListener() {
        @Override
        public void onSuccess() {
            setPeerDiscoveryHandler(true);
            Log.v(TAG, "Message Sent");
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(int reason) {
            Log.e(TAG,"Error on Discovery Peers, code: "+reason);
            setPeerDiscoveryHandler(false);
        }
    });
}


But guess what, even after doing this new code and clicking on the Run button, it was like I didnt do nothing! And I realized that was happening after I started to check my logcat and the message:

"Discovery Peers Success" 

was being printed, but I had it removed from the code (as you can see in my new code). I tried to rebuild and clean the project, uninstall the application from the mobile before deploying it again, but nothing seems to take effect. Any thoughts about it ?

Thanks in advance for all help guyz.

Well guyz, turns out that I found the solution for that problem of mine. Actually, I dont know why, but when that starts to happen you need to click on a button called "Sync Project with Gradle Files", and it will sync all your project files all over again. Like I said before, I really dont understand why that is needed, but in case someone have this problem in the future thats a solution. Thanks.
