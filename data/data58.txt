Title: How can I define a nonstandard file counterpart in Xcode 4?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have some files which are structured (something) like this:

MONLibrary/file.h
MONLibrary/file.support.h


I'd like Xcode to recognize these files as counterparts of each other, much like file.h and file.c are recognized counterparts. How can this be accomplished?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This isn't exactly what you're after (I'd like to know if there's an answer to that too...), but renaming file.support.h to file.support will cause it to be recognized as a counterpart.

It won't be treated as an Obj-C header file by default w/r/t syntax highlighting/build rules, but you can easily override this with the file inspector (âŒ˜-opt-1).
    
    
Title: How to have Netbeans projects export their dependencies like Eclipse does?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Eclipse, if a project uses a particular JAR file, I can mark it to provide/export it. 

So if another project has a reference to the former, then the particular JAR will be available too. 

How can I do that in Netbeans?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In Netbeans you always have to add JAR in the project properties, unless you use some deployment tools.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Aptana for linux comes as ready-to-launch zipped package. The
problem is that I don't know where I should put this unzipped folder.

I don't like it being in (polluting!) my home folder.

Where would you put this? Any suggestions? Where do you keep your Aptana's folder? Where would be the most elegant place? Is there special place to put such executables (like C:/Program Files on Windows)?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I keep that kind of stuff in my /opt directory.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
This is how i have it setup:
1. I have created /home/bin and put the execs there (added bin to my Path so i can open Aptana straight from the terminal) 
2. Created a "development" folder in the home folder (same level as Documents) and i have all my projects in that directory.

I am really not sure this is the right way since I am new to this too but this is what made sense to me.
    
    
Title: Dynamic method definition with GroovyDSL in IntelliJ
Description: 
    
    
                    
I was trying to define a dynamic method using the GroovyDSL scripting capabilities in IntelliJ. The starting guide "Scripting IDE for DSL awareness" gives you a good idea on how to get started with this. The dynamic method definition in my DSL is more complex than the example though and I am not quite sure how to build this. You can imagine it working like dynamic finder methods in Grails except that you can combine an arbitrary number of criteria with a boolean And keyword in any order. All keywords are not defined in the class that I am invoking the method on but could be defined in the GDSL file. The method always starts with submitTransactionWith. Here's an example:

clientDSL.submitTransactionWithCriteria1AndCriteria2AndCriteria3(arg1, arg2, arg3)


I started out with this but that only works for one criteria and doesn't take into account that you can combined multiple criteria in any order.

def ctx = context(ctype: "my.client.ClientDSL")

contributor(ctx) {
    ['Criteria1', 'Criteria2', 'Criteria3'].each {
        method name: "submitTransactionWith${it}",
               type: 'java.util.Map', 
               params: [args: 'java.util.Collection']
    }
}


I was wondering if there's special support for that kind of dynamic method. I'd also be interested in how the DSL for Grails is modeled internally in IntelliJ.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The Grails DSL in located in ${idea.home}/plugins/GrailsGriffon/lib/standardDsls 

It would probably help you for your problem. They create string arrays of all the method name combinations ahead of time, and then just iterate through them in their contributor creating a method using the arrays of strings for names.
    
    
Title: Pausing execution of embedded IronPython
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am currently trying to write an IDE with Debugger for IronPython in C#.

I can run the script and get the traceback, but I'm not yet able to pause the script (e.g. at a breakpoint).

Is there a possibility to do so? At least it seems that IronPythonStudio can do this.

Kind regards.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
To pause the IronPython script you will need to stop the traceback function from exiting. When the traceback function exits the script will continue to run.

Harry Pierson wrote a great set of posts on creating a lightweight IronPython debugger which will be a good starting point. He covers pausing the IronPython script in the Hybrid App Debugging - Threading post.

IronPythonStudio uses the more heavyweight .NET debugger that is part of Visual Studio and does not use tracebacks.
    
    
Title: Turn off CSS image path correction in Eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have RAD 7.5 and when modifying CSS files, RAD "auto-corrects" image paths "on save".  I haven't found a way to turn that off but I don't want to keep this behavior.

The issue here is that let's say I have css like this:

.someClass {
   background: (images/someImage.gif);
}


When I save the file while in CSS design mode in RAD, the file will try to automatically change the image path to something like:

.someClass {
   background: (root/WEBAPPLICATION/images/someImage.gif);
}

I added a File Association to *.css files in Window...Preferences...Editors...File Associations.  Add *.css file type, and select "Text Editor" in the Associated Editor.
Then select "Default" to make this the default editor.

This will open css files as plain text, and not use the automatic update of image paths.

I'm currently trying to recover some old code that was developed using IBM Visual Age for Java. Unfortunately I do not have an installation anymore, and the only thing I have is just a ".dat" file containing the repository.

Is there any way to get my code back? Otherwise, is there any way to get an old Visual Age for Java install so that I can try to recover my code directly?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It appears that IBM.com does not have the Visual Age Developer Domain online anymore, and hence not the trial downloads which would have been perfect for your purpose.  

I would suggest that you call your local IBM branch, and explain your problem and ask if you can get access to one of the old distributions to see if your problem can be fixed.

If not, you might consider decompiling the current class/jar files before looking into purchasing from IBM or finding an old copy on ebay or similar.

I have been really working more with oops lately in PHP. I am getting more complex in my project, and I basically put each Class into its own file.  I keep losing focus on my code however, as there are so many files and some of my classes are really tests. I can't easily tell the difference between what is real classes or what are just tests that I am not referencing any more.

I'm looking for a PowerShell IDE. My requirements are simple:

Ability to edit the code while stopped at a breakpoint.


This last point is the problem. I've already looked at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/171514/best-ide-for-powershell and tried PowerShell ISE and PowerGUI - both disallow this. (I've also tried PowerShellAnalyzer, which can only be adequately described in one word: FAIL)

PowerSE can edit scripts while stopped at a breakpoint.

I know it's not an issue for you as you said, but you can continue stepping through the script, but it executes the old code so the position marker no longer lines up with the code being executed.

Title: How to see full compile path in Eclipse?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have looked for an answer for this nearly every where that I can think of, but there doesn't seem to be any way to actually SEE what Eclipse "runs" to compile the projects (as it does need the JDK installed and visible to actually build). I ask because I imported a few jars into my project, and even though I've looked through all the javac documentation, I can't seem to figure out how to mimic it quite like Eclipse does. I really, really need to be able to compile on the command line in this case - Eclipse or any other IDE just isn't what is needed.

I started to look through the Eclipse source, and although this sounds lazy, I just became overwhelmed and figured I would ask here first, hoping someone else had the same question at one point.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Eclipse JDT does not require the JDK and does not use javac - it uses it's own compiler.

You can see the classpath by reading your project .classpath file. The various builders that are used to perform build operations (Java, or whatever the project builds) are listed in the .project file. (These are also listed in the project settings.)

It is possible to invoke Eclipse to build your project in headless mode, or write Ant scripts that can be executed both with the JDK and within Eclipse, or install Maven support for internal and external building. It is also possible to configure the project builders to rely only on external tools.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Look at these two articles.
http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Builders/builders.html
http://www.eclipsepluginsite.com/builders-natures-markers.html

Look at your .classpath file and start building an ANT build.xml. You need to do this to be able to have consistent builds on a build machine anyways. It is unlikely that a build server would have eclipse installed on it anyways.

Maven is also another tool that is used for builds. In our shop we use Ant.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Have a look at ant4eclipse - this project allows for generating the appropriate ant data structures for invoking &lt;javac&gt; from the .classpath files and a projectSet.psf file.

By using this we can use Eclipse "natively" and bend ant to conform to Eclipse.  The usual approach is the other way around.
    
    
Title: How do I force MyEclipse to hot-deploy a JavaScript file to my JBoss instance?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm having trouble with MyEclipse 7.1.1 hot-deployment of files to my JBoss 4 server.

The problem is this: while my server is running, I can make changes to various JAVA and HTML files, which are then hot-deployed immediately (I can see the changes reflected in my browser when I refresh the page). However, while working on a particular JavaScript file, my changes are not being hot-deployed. This makes it very difficult to work on and debug this file, since I have to stop my server, redeploy, and start it again each time I make changes. This is a new problem - it didn't used to happen with this file, so I think something got screwed up in my MyEclipse configuration.

I've verified that my projects (JBoss 4 instances) are all set up in "Exploded" mode for hot-deployment.

I'm also 99% sure that this isn't an issue with my browser, since I always refresh with CTRL+F5, and I've tried a number of things like clearing my browser cache to get the currently deployed version of the file.

I've also tried doing a "clean" on the project while the server is running, and that didn't force a deployment either.

Any sort of solution would be helpful. I'd love for MyEclipse to deploy the file automatically, but I'm also open to manually forcing hot-deployment of this particular file while I work on it.

Thank you.

The following fixed it:

Visual Web Developer Express will also work well. Note that Visual Studio 2008 versions use "SharePoint Designer 2007" as the HTML editor. Even though Visual Studio uses the same HTML editor, the editor user-interface is much better in SharePoint Designer 2007 or FrontPage 2003.

Title: Eclipse buildtime and runtime classpaths for easy execution of junit test cases
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've a large eclipse project with multiple junit classes. I'm trying to strike a balance between adding runtime resources to the eclipse project classpath, and the need to configure mutliple junit launch configurations.

I realise the default eclipse build classpath is inherited by all unit test configurations, but some of my tests require extra runtime resources. I could add these resources to the build classpath, but this does slow my overall project build time (since 
it has to keep more files in synch). I don't like the idea of including * resources and jars on the runtime classpath. 

The two options that i have are these, the positive and negative cases as i see it are listed

1 : Add all runtime resources to eclipse classpath.


POS I can select a unit test and run it without having to configure the test classpath.
POS Extra resources on build classpath means eclipse slows down. 
NEG More difficult to ensure each test uses the correct resources.


2 : Configure the classpath of each unit test


POS I know exactly what resources are being used by a test.
POS Smaller build classpath means quicker build and execution by eclipse.
NEG Its a pain having to setup multiple separate junit runtime classpaths. 


Ideally i'd like to configure one base junit runtime configuration, which takes the default eclipse build classpath, adds extra runtime jars and resources. This configuration could then be reused by the specific junit test cases, Is anything like this possible?

Looking at a specific junit launch configuration which can be exported to a share project file

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;launchConfiguration type="org.eclipse.jdt.junit.launchconfig"&gt;
&lt;stringAttribute key="bad_container_name" value="/CR-3089_5_1_branch."/&gt;
&lt;listAttribute key="org.eclipse.debug.core.MAPPED_RESOURCE_PATHS"&gt;
&lt;listEntry value="/CR-3089_5_1_branch/src/com/x/y/z/ParserJUnitTest.java"/&gt;
&lt;/listAttribute&gt;
&lt;listAttribute key="org.eclipse.debug.core.MAPPED_RESOURCE_TYPES"&gt;
&lt;listEntry value="1"/&gt;
&lt;/listAttribute&gt;
&lt;stringAttribute key="org.eclipse.jdt.junit.CONTAINER" value=""/&gt;

&lt;stringAttribute key="org.eclipse.jdt.junit.TESTNAME" value=""/&gt;
&lt;stringAttribute key="org.eclipse.jdt.junit.TEST_KIND" value="org.eclipse.jdt.junit.loader.junit4"/&gt;
&lt;stringAttribute key="org.eclipse.jdt.launching.MAIN_TYPE" value="com.x.y.z.ParserJUnitTest"/&gt;
&lt;stringAttribute key="org.eclipse.jdt.launching.PROJECT_ATTR" value="CR-3089_5_1_branch"/&gt;
&lt;/launchConfiguration&gt;


is it possible to extend/reuse this configuration, and parameterise the 'org.eclipse.jdt.launching.MAIN_TYPE' value?

I'm aware of the commons launch and jar manifest file solutions to configuring the classpath, but they both seem to assume that an ant build is run before the test can execute. I want to avoid any eclipse dependency on calling an ant target when 
refactoting code and executing tests. 

Basically - What is the the easiest way to seperate and maintain the eclipse buildtime classpath and junit runtime classpaths?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The first solution could be to separate completely the project from its unit tests:


one project for the current build
one project for JUnit tests (or several if different kind of classpath are involved): that project will have the first dev project in its dependencies, and will not have to specify the classpath from that development.


A cleaner way (because it would be used within Eclipse, but also outside Eclipse) would be to transform your project in a maven one, through m2eclipse for instance.
That way, maven can manage the dependency compositions of several projects in order to have the right classpath for the test task.

Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use django-nxhtml-mumamo-mode. It is part of the nXhtml package. (It is shipped with Emacs Starter Kit, too.) For JavaScript, it uses javascript-mode instead of js2-mode.

Today I have question about Eclipse. I use this IDE very long and I think it is good, but last time I miss for some functionalities...

Is it possible to set some shortcut which will do something like:

Mark some text ('Hello world'), trigger shortcut (Ctrl+T) and it will do something with that text - in example adds text before and after selected text ($this-&gt;_('Hello world'))

?

Thanks for any sugestion !
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
From this, it appears you have to implement your own command in a plugin. The process looks more involved than simply setting a menu choice.



Equivalent functionality can be defined without commands, if you're willing to give up the keyboard shortcut and use content assist instead.

I'm not sure if it will work with the language you're using (PHP?), but with Java in Eclipse it is possible to use Code Templates.

You would define your own template, when it was applicable and what it would do. This could then be accessed with Ctrl+Space through the possible content assist methods. So in the context of Java statements, I can define:

this.call(${word_selection});

So when I highlight a word, such as "Hello, world", I can use the template to change it to:

this.call("Hello, world");

(There are ways to limit it to only String types instead of word selections, but that will most likely not apply to your language, so I didn't pursue exactly how to do it.)

The Code Templates menu is available through Window-&gt;Preferences.

I just started using Eclipse PHP.

I finally figured out how to turn on auto complete code assist.

My problem is that when I use require or include, those variables in those files aren't showing up.

Example,

code1.php

&lt;? $test = 'hi'; ?&gt;


code2.php

&lt;? require('code1.php'); ?&gt;


When I am editing code2.php, $test variable doesn't show up in auto complete (aka code assist)

Title: VisualWorks Smalltalk-like IDE for C++ (Linux)
Description: 
    
    
                    
Sup bros,

Is there anything out there for C++ which displays the class hierarchies as a tree on the left panel?  I've been using VisualWorks Smalltalk for a while, and the way that classes are displayed, and methods broken out, makes it very easy to build a mental picture of what the class does.  Sadly, I can't find anything similar for C++.  Does Eclipse perhaps have such a mode?

Thanks,
frapple_hok
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Unfortunately C++ doesn't lend itself to this sort of class browser for two reasons:


There is no central repository or
image with all of the active classes
in it.  The class definitions are
spread around many files.
Class definitions and files live in
a M:M relationship.  Not all of a
class is necessarily defined in a
single file and one file can have
code for more than one class.


On Linux, KDevelop, Eclipse and various others all have C++ support and a greater or lesser degree of support for the introspection that is possible on an arbitrary base of C++ source code.  

You might also get some mileage from ctags, which analyses the source code files and identifies the definitions for types, classes, members etc.  This can be used with any decent editor such as vim, emacs or many other editors and IDE's.  From a source code editor that supports tags, you can place the cursor over a reference and jump to its definition.  It's not quite as good as Inspect but you don't really have the concept of a running image.  The closest you will get to that is a debugger such as DDD.

Caveat emptor:  I've never used this tool myself.  (Though perhaps I'll start...)

From long experience I've learned that I can put "emacs" + anything into google and find it.  (Literally anything!  Some people have waayyy too much free time on their hands...)

In this case, "emacs class browser" turns up EBROWSE, which might be what you are looking for.

In terms of a "left panel", emacs supports splitting a single window up vertically (split-window-vertically) or horizontally (split-window-horizontally) however you like.  Or using multiple windows if you prefer (make-frame-command).

In terms of more typical IDE features, emacs supports font-locking (colorizing), make integration (jump to error), gdb integration (debugging), language-based auto-indent, TAGS [etags] (jump to tag definition), diff'ing two files (or file against revision), checkin/checkout to/from source code revision systems, spell-checking, etc.  (I'm sure other stackoverflow entries have highlighted emacs's many features.  Or try slashdot.  Definitely check out the "complete" function! (require 'completion)  And perhaps "align-regexp" too!)

There are at least two options I'm aware of:


OO Browser, whose entire purpose is to bring Smalltalk-style browsers to other languages.  I do not know how well the project is maintained, but despite its rather lackluster appearance, it worked extremely well the last time I tried to use it (which would've been about three years ago).
Code Browser, which is designed to provide generic ways to navigate through, and manage, complex code hierarchies.  It provides many ways to view code, but one of them is indeed the Smalltalk browser model (e.g., take a look at this screen shot of the Code Browser editing itself)

    
    
Title: How can I enable automatic code suggestions in eclipse for c++?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've decided to use eclipse as my primary IDE for c++ coding but I can't seem to figure out the automatic autocomplete. When I press ctrl + space it shows them just fine but not when I'm typing normally. I tried browsing through the settings but in content assist setting under auto-activation it only has checkboxes for ., ::, and -&gt; triggers and not for letters, numbers and parentheses. I tried browsing around the web and all the solutions were for the java version of the eclipse IDE, not the c++ one.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I do not think it is possible with the C++ editor. As you described, automatic trigger for content assist only works after typing ., -&gt; or :: (if enabled) and there is no way to make it work for other combinations. See the dialog below:

As you mentioned, Ctrl + Space can always be used to manually launch the tool, but I understand it can become annoying.
So to answer your question: No, it is not possible (for C++).

Title: How do I keep the Locals IDE window always on top while debugging?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I found a few posts that explain how to keep a programmatically created window always on top.
I was unable however to find an explanation about how to keep always on top the IDE integrated Locals window, while I am debugging (I run the program with F10 for instance).
I see that there is no answer in a long time, so I realize that my question is not expressed clearly enough. I shall clarify.
Usually, while debugging, the active window is the IDE and so also the control keys (F10, F11 and so on) are also active. In the same time, the Locals window is on top and so one may watch the values of the variables while debugging.
In my case,while the IDE window is active, the Locals window is hidden and in order to see the Locals window, I have to press its tab on the status bar. when the Locals window appears (becomes active) and the values of the variables are visible, the IDE window becomes hidden and the control keys ate not active anymore. I have to press the tab of the IDE window on the taskbar in order to resume debugging.
Please help.
Thank you in advance.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It sounds like your locals panel is auto-hiding as is your main code panel, or are they actually in separate windows? Assuming the same window but differing panels...

There should be a dropdown option with pin or auto-hide or float, you may also find that dragging the locals window (by titlebar) to another panel that remains open to be a better option, or drag it to be a floating window and resize the IDE to be 3/4 of screen and locals to the remaining 1/4. The final option is to close the locals window and reopen a new one using the Debug menu and then experiment with new positioning and docking options. 

One last resort may be to reset the window layout to default and get back to the way it should be setup.

Good luck and let us know how you fare.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I open a solution and one of its .cs file in Visual Studio 2017, and then right-click on the tab of the file and choose "Open Containing Folder" in context menu. It shows a warning window that reads "Unable to open the folder. It might have been deleted or existing permissions might be insufficient." But after that, the containing folder is opened normally.

I try to check permission of the folder, and find nothing is wrong. And it seems that no matter where the containing folder is, the warning always shows. By the way, the detailed version of IDE is "VS Enterprise 2017 Version 15.9.2".

What I expect is that after the menu item is chosen, the containing folder shows without the unnecessary warning.

java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            // your main code ...
        }
    });

java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
           JFrame wait = new JFrame("Resultado");
           wait.setVisible(true);
           wait.setSize(300, 300);
           JLabel labelwait = new JLabel("Loading");
           JPanel panelwait = new JPanel();
           wait.add(panelwait);
           panelwait.add(labelwait);
        }
    });


If you Use JavaFx The solution is :

Platform.runLater(() -&gt; {
        //your main code her ...
});


Example :

Platform.runLater(() -&gt; {
        JFrame wait = new JFrame("Resultado");
        wait.setVisible(true);
        wait.setSize(300, 300);
