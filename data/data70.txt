Turns out users don't have to edit all the code templates to get rid of automatic commenting!

Once navigating to the Code Templates Panel from the path described in the question, there's an option at the bottom of the panel to "Automatically add comments for new methods and types." Once you uncheck this box, Eclipse will no longer check the box to generate comments automatically when creating new files.

The C/C++ Project is the new wizard to create projects. If you select it, on the next page you will get the choice of C or C++ project:



The new wizard has been created to unify all the wizards and make adding new ones nicer and easier. For example, if you have Arduino tools installed then you can create an Ardunio sketch that way.

Title: Java RCP: Create Extension point from existing extension
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm currently using a Java application developed with Eclipse and RCP based; this application has few plugin files in jar format, these file are including special procedures for pricelist generation.

I need to develop a completely new application that uses the existing extensions to build new pricelist, so I created a new Plug-in project and I tried to create the Extension Point compatible with my existing extensions.

The problem is I'm not expert at all with RCP, so I made for sure some mistake: when I try to get the extension with this:

IExtensionRegistry reg = Platform.getExtensionRegistry();
IConfigurationElement[] extensions = 
reg.getConfigurationElementsFor("prices.year");

for (int i = 0; i &lt; extensions.length; i++) {
    if(extensions[i].getName().equals("2016")) {
        // Do something
    }
}


I always get 0 elements.

So for sure I made a mistake while creating the Extension point or when I added the available extension... or both!

Actually:
- I added the jar files in my project, then included in the build configuration
- I created the Extension point
- I open the .exsd file, added a "client" element with a "class" attribute; this class "Implements" field points to an object defined inside a jar class (the same object is implemented inside the plugin file)

Inside the Plugin file (.jar) i have this:

public class Pricelist2017 extends Pricelist
 implements IPricedata
 {
   ...


-

EDIT:
After applying greg-449 suggestion, now I'm able to get some extension, but I face problem when I try to access them:

IExtensionRegistry reg = Platform.getExtensionRegistry();
IConfigurationElement[] extensions = reg.getConfigurationElementsFor("prices.year");

for (int i = 0; i &lt; extensions.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(extension[i].getName());
    System.out.println(extension[i].getAttribute("id"));
    System.out.println(extension[i].toString());
}


I get (for 2 extensions found):

client
null
prices.year.2016.Doc16@21b2e768

client
null
prices.year.2015.Doc15@313b2ea6

Answer 1: 

    
    
So far you have just defined the extension point. That just makes the extension point available for use, it does not create any uses of the extension.

First make sure that your extension point definition defines how you use the client element. You need to have something like a Sequence in the extension section:


You must now create some uses of the extension point. In the 'Extensions' tab of the plugin.xml editor click 'Add...' and create an extension. This is where you specify the class that implements IPricedata:

Title: Why autocomplete sometimes does not work in python IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am working on some python codes in PyCharm IDE. The autocomplete feature works fine in some cases, but not the others. For example, after I import matplotlib as plt, after I type &quot;plt.&quot;, all possible methods shows below

However, some variables do not seem to have autocomplete. If I type the methods manually, the program works fine. But the IDE just does not prompt me what methods are available to the variable. It shows something starting with &quot;__&quot;, but not methods that I am supposed to use. For example, after I create ax1 = plt.subplot2grid((1,1), (0,0)), I can invoke tick_params method on ax1 variable. It is a valid method. However, this method does not show up in the list when I type &quot;ax1.&quot;

I don't think this problem is specific to PyCharm. I have run into the similar issue in other Python IDE or Python Notebook in the past. What am I missing here?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
autocomplete can only help you with classes ... that is a method that you are calling to get the axes object

consider 

def get_something():
    if caseA: return Something1()
    return DefaultSomething()


pycharm(or any ide) has no idea which class would be returned its either one of those or maybe nothing ... what should it give you as autocomplete?

that said you can tell pycharm it must be of type matplotlib.Axes 

ax1 = plt.subplots(....)
assert isinstance(ax1,matplotlib.Axes)
ax1.   # now autocomplete works

It looks like your IntelliJ IDEA installation is corrupted. It can be caused by the malfunction during the patch update or if you have unpacked the .tar.gz file into the existing directory (on top of the previous version).

Title: CodeLite not using Global compile settings or project compile settings
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am currently using CodeLite for my IDE for C++. There are many features in the IDE that I enjoy using and the interface is pretty simple.

Recently, I am moving my code for wxWigets from 3.0 to 3.1. There are a number of functions that are exclusive to 3.1 that I find will be most helpful in developing my C++ applications. Most notable, the wxWindow::FromDIP function.

I was able to grab the wxWidgets source from online and compile it successfully. I right clicked on the project folder, went to the C++ compiler settings and made sure to include the location of my compiled wx-3.1 library (which is /usr/local/include/wx-3.1).

As a test, I added in the FromDIP() function in some parts of the code. The code completion was able to pick up what i was typing and it was able to "see" the FromDIP() function.

When I went to build the project, the build failed at all points that I had the FromDIP function. IT was saying that it wasn't recognizable.

I then went to the Global compiler settings (Settings-
Answer 1: 

    
    
By default, CodeLite uses wx-config tool to get the correct paths and definitions needed by the compiler.

All you need to do is make sure that the correct wx-config tool is used. 
To do so, just type from the terminal wx-config --cflags and see which flags are being printed to the terminal.

You don't (and should not) manually add the compiler paths, just in:
Project Settings-&gt;Compiler-&gt;Compiler options make sure you have $(shell wx-config --cxxflags) and in Project settings-&gt;Linker-&gt;Linker options make sure you have $(shell wx-config --libs) 

About the global paths: You should not add these unless you really know what you are doing. Theses paths are used for all workspaces, even those not related to wxWidgets. All the project settings should be set in the workspace level (this way if you share your project with other people they could benefit from your settings as well)

In case you have multiple wxWidgets installations you need to make sure that the correct wx-config is used. To do this you can do one of the followings:


Assuming you want /usr/loca/bin/wx-config to be used, update the PATH environment variable in CodeLite from Settings-&gt;Environment variables by adding this line PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
Use full path to wx-config so in Project Settings-&gt;Compiler-&gt;Compiler Options use this option $(shell /usr/local/bin/wx-config --cxxflags) (do the same in Project settings-&gt;Linker-&gt;Linker Options)

Answer 1: 

    
    
There are 2 tools in CodeLite that are useful to navigate huge source files.


Zoom Navigator
Outline View


Zoom Navigator should work with any source (or other text) file. What it does is simply to show the source file in a separate window but with a much small font size. You can then scroll through the tiny lines quickly and click on an area of interest to bring that part into the main editor window.

Zoom Navigator is a plugin that come with the default installation, but may need to be enabled from the Plugins menu (Manage Plugins...).

Outline View is a tab in the Workspace view area. For this to work, the file needs to be part of the current Workspace and I think that either CTags or Clang (i.e. code completion) need to be working correctly. Therefore, AFAIK this will only work with C / C++ but it may also work with PHP and other files if there is a suitable parser.

Outline view lists all the classes in a file, and all the function and data members of each class. A slight drawback is that it doesn't sort the lists into alphabetical order, instead they follow the order in the source file.

1. Run time options

If you like to have 'MetalLookAndFeel &amp; fontsize 14, run below command

netbeans --laf javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel --fontsize 14


You can install list of themes from this link → Netbeans themes. You can launch a different theme programmatically based upon your choice.

2. Using configuration file

This can be achieved by updating the netbeans.conf file located in below location ${nb-install}/etc/netbeans.conf
for ex:


  C:\Program Files\NetBeans 8.1\etc\netbeans.conf


Update the conf file with desired theme &amp; font size programmatically.

In the picture below I'm on a breakpoint looping through the (196) elements of a TStrings. The current index is 193.

The Visualizer only shows 17 elements.

Can anything be done about that (other than specifically inspecting element 'x')?


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As far as I can tell, there's not much that you can do about this, short of submitting a feature request (and upgrading if it succeeds).  My guess it that's what's being truncated, like WarrenP implied, is the size of the data being fed to the visualizer, rather than the particular number of lines in the TStrings object.  This is why I think that:

Assuming XE2 comes with the same sample debugger visualizers as later XE versions, you
could try this:


Uninstall the Embarcadero Sample Visualizers package if you have it installed in the IDE.
Copy the StringListVisualizer.Pas unit to somewhere convenient.
Create a new .Dpk project and add the copied StringListVisualizer.Pas to its
Contains list; its Requires list should include Rtl and DesignIDE.
Open the copied StringListVisualizer.Pas and locate the routine

function TStringListViewerFrame.Evaluate(Expression: string): string;


You'll see that its local vars include

  ResultStr: array[0..4095] of Char;


Change the 4095 to 32767.  The point of doing this is to make sure that the
the Strings Visualizer display isn't truncated because of the size of this buffer,
in light of WarrenP's comment.  In fact the truncation that's causing your
problem is seemingly elsewhere.


In StringListVisualizer.Pas, put debugger breakpoints on the lines

  case EvalRes of



and

      if not FDeferredError then


in function TStringListViewerFrame.Evaluate(Expression: string): string.

You need 2 breakpoints because there are two ways Evaluate can complete,
depending on the value of EvalRes.  It always returns erDeferred for me.


Compile and run your Dpk project.  It will invoke a second instance of the IDE.
In the second instance, load and run your problem project.  When your breakpoint in that trips, right-click in the Watches window and go to Visualizers | Show Strings.
Shortly one or other of your breakpoints in StringListVisualizer.Pas will trip
evaluating the strings property that's giving you trouble (it may trip on
several other expressions to evaluate first.  When it does, single step to where the result of function TStringListViewerFrame.Evaluate is assigned, then evaluate

Length(Result)


and

Copy(Result, Length(Result) - 100, Length(Result))


Using my test data, I get a value for Length(Result) which is 4101, and the
Copy evaluates to the last part of the strings .text, just before its display
in the visualizer gets truncated.

It seems fairly clear from those results (in my case at least, ymmv) that the data truncation occurs somewhere in the debugger machinery that feeds the visualizer rather than in the visualizer itself.  Somebody who knows more about the debugger internals than me may be able to suggest another way of getting untruncated data to be fed to the visualizer.

Update: A couple of thoughts:


A work-around for the apparent "4k" truncation of what's available to a visualizer might be to link into the app being debugged a function, let's call it TStringsPagedWindow(Input : TStsrings; Page : Integer) : String which returns a section of a TStrings object hopefully working around the "4k" limitation, at the expense of needing to watch it, rather than the TStrings object per se, in the Watch Window, and specify the Page value.  Obviously this would not be wildly convenient, and would require the TStringsPagedWindow function to be linked into the executable being debugged.
Following on from 1., seeing as a debugger visualizer can apparently evaluate any valid expression, one could envisage constructing (in the visualizer) an expression based on the name of the TStrings variable being watched and invoking TStringsPagedWindow automatically to populate a GUI object that could display its contents.  This is the closest I can think of at the moment to WarrenP's suggestion "Since you can write your own visualizers, it is possible you could add such arrows, and use a different control to show the contents. "  Maybe quite a lot of work, but my idea of fun; perhaps I'll have a go if there's any interest.

    
    
Title: Finding uninitialized variables before running script
Description: 
    
    
                    
How do I detect whether all variables have been initialized in a Python script before running the script? Ideally, I would like my compiler (currently Wing IDE) to detect errors as part of the build/compilation process. This is to prevent the program from crashing after ~30min of loading data etc. due to a simple mistake.

I know that Python can manipulate variable in all sorts of ways. However, my scripts tend to be fairly simple and I do not expect the method to be bullet-proof.

As an example I'd like the error detection method to find simple errors such as the misspelling of grocery_bill in the script below.

prices = {'apple': 0.40, 'banana': 0.50}
my_purchase = {
    'apple': 1,
    'banana': 6}
grocery_bill = sum(prices[fruit] * my_purchase[fruit]
                   for fruit in my_purchase)
print 'I owe the grocer $%.2f' % grocery_blil

There's a two options I can currently think of.   


PyLint


This tool can analyse all your source code and try to detect places where bugs may be happening. This should detect things like the one you have mentioned.


PyCharm


This is an IDE by Jetbrains, and you can turn on spell check for all your variables. While this does not stop typos from happening, it does make it far easier to catch them. 

If you're a student, you can get the full version of PyCharm for free.

Description: 
    
    
                    


The modules in Android Studio are all defined in settings.gradle which is in root directory of a project. But why are they different? I mean why a module is android library or main module.

I hope I explained my question clearly. If not, please let me know. I really want to figure it out.

I tried adding an launcher activity in android library module, but it cannot be changed to a regular module. I want to know can I change a library module to regular module ?

Thank you
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
An android library is supposed to be used by other modules and it cannot be launched on its own. While a regular module has a launcher activity defined which is launched everytime you click on the application icon

If you are using gradle you need to change

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'


to 

apply plugin:'com.android.library'

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Thank you for Ajit Pratap Singh. His answer solved my problem. At the top line in build.gradle files of each modules, there is "apply plugin:" text defines which type of module it is. like 'com.android.application' is regular module, 'com.android.library' is library module.

Description: 
    
    
                    
One can auto indent all code in a .m file by typing ctrl+A followed by ctrl+I. However, this requires selecting all code which in my MATLAB IDE (R2011a, Linux, with Windows Shortcuts) moves the cursor to the end of the .m file. I then have to scroll back to where I was working.

Is there a way to autoindent an entire .m file without moving the cursor to the end of the file?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Many modern IDEs and text editors, including MATLAB, support the keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+g for the "Go to line #" command.

I would therefore suggest simply remembering the line number you were on, and just coming back to it using the aforementioned shortcut after applying the indent the way you described.

I'm using Eclipse to develop a Java program. But in my program I have some methods in Eclipse which are striked through. What does it mean ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It means that your method are deprecated. You may find another way to do the same thing
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
All those methods/class which eclipse found start with @Deprecated annotation is displayed with a strike through. 

A method is made deprecated to discourage the user/client of the method not to use it. Because this method might be remover from the later release of the API/package. In this case the there may be an alternative method to use. A good java doc should contains what to use in alternate of the deprecated method. 
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
It is a deprecated method. From the documentation:


  A program element annotated @Deprecated is one that programmers are
  discouraged from using, typically because it is dangerous, or because
  a better alternative exists.

Title: Assigning shortcut keys for adding code templates in Xcode
Description: 
    
    
                    
This might be a silly question, but I've started learning Xcode and one thing came to my mind today.

That is, some codes are reused again and again throughout the project.

For example, for debugging purpose you can put NSLog(@"error!"); in many different places.

Is it possible at all to assign some shortcut keys for adding these "template" codes in Xcode, so that whenever you need to add a template, you can just hit the corresponding shortcut key?

I have tried to google it, but I didn't get lucky.

This might be a trivial function or even an unnecessary one, but if it is possible to hit just one combination of keys instead of typing a line of code, I think it will help improving the speed of coding.

Any ideas? If not in Xcode, does any other IDE provide this function?

Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes you can!



Setting it up is slightly non-intuitive, but here is how you can do it.


Type the code you want to templatize.
In the right-side bar, select the Code Snippet Library option in the horizontal toolbar halfway down the bar (which has the {} icon).
Select your code and drag it to the Code Snippet Library.


Refer to the image above.  Anything you want to be replacable, enclose in &lt;# whatever #&gt;.  

In this screen shot above, I have set the shortcut to ddd, and the replacable text is &lt;# protocol #&gt;.

Now, when I type the shortcut, I see:

Title: Selenium IDE: How to verify &lt;TD&gt; Contents when it contains a mix of tags and &lt;BR&gt; breaks
Description: 
    
    
                    
My goal is to verify the contents of a complicated TD cell. It contains a SPAN tage and many BR tags. I'm restricted to using Selenium IDE for this test. The source text looks like this:

&lt;td&gt;
 &lt;span&gt;&lt;b style="whatever"&gt;TEXT_1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
 &lt;br style="whatever"&gt;
  TEXT_2
 &lt;br style="whatever"&gt;
  TEXT_3
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;


Neither TEXT_1 / TEXT_2 / TEXT_3 contain any spaces.

I pull the TD contents into the variable 'td_cell_contents'. Then Javascript is used to split that variable on a single space:

store | javascript{storedVars['td_cell_contents'].split(' ')[0]} | var_1
store | javascript{storedVars['td_cell_contents'].split(' ')[1]} | var_2


var_1 evaluates to "TEXT_1" as I would expect because there's a space between it and the rest of the cell.
When I echo var_2, the log file shows that that is a new line between "TEXT_2" and "TEXT_3" as I would expect since there is a BR tag between them:

[info] echo: var_2: TEXT 2
TEXT 3


I tried to use JavaScript to strip the newlines because this newline is making strong comparison very difficult:

runScript | var_2 = var_2.replace(/(?:\r\n|\r|\n)/g, '&lt;br /&gt;'); |


When I run the echo command again for var_2, the log shows that the newline is still there. It's blocking the ability to do string matching.

Looking for help... and am open to using other approaches within Selenium IDE. If I can verify the cell contents somehow without stripping the newline that's fine with me.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'm making some assumptions in answering this question. It sounds like your goal is to validate the contents of var_2. Stripping out the newline is a means to an end. There are other ways to accomplish this though.

Why don't you try to create a variable called "expected_var_2_value", and set it equal to the expected var_2 string WITHOUT the newline stripped out as follows:

store | TEXT_2\nTEXT_3 | expected_var_2_value


Then just compare it to var_2:

verifyEval | storedVars['expected_var_2_value']==storedVars['var_2'] | true


For some reason the Javascript in the verifyEval works for me when comparing storedVars['expected_var_2_value'] but fails if the actual underlying string is provided.

Anyway, I would appreciate feedback on how this goes for you.
    
    
Title: Phpstorm: add copyright information / licence header to files in project
Description: 
    
    
                    
My existing files miss copyright info. I want to add a licence header to severals files in a project with Phpstorm / other JetBrains IDE.

This page doesn't help: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/topicId609815.html

Anyone know the process please?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In 2016 JetBrains added a Copyright tool exactly for this purpose.

See https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2016/01/managing-copyright-notices-in-phpstorm/ for more information.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I have the same requirement, but the closest thing I could get is to use the Live Templates feature. Basically I added a new Template under the PHP Group with the abbreviation copyright and the following text

/**************************************************************************
 * Copyright (C) $user$, Inc - All Rights Reserved
 *
 * &lt;omitted copyright blah&gt;
 *
 * @file        $file$
 * @author      $user$
 * @site        &lt;my website&gt;
 * @date        $date$
 */


Unfortunately it seems impossible to use Template Variables such as ${NAME} in the context of a Live Template, so you are forced to stick with the provided expressions. In this case I used fileName(), user() and date() which were enough for my case.

Finally you can type copyright and press Tab to generate the header.
    
    
Title: Class __init__ attributes, DRY vs IDE functinality
Description: 
    
    
                    
What's the proper way to follow the DRY rule in class __init__ method?

I know this two ways:

class Foo:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z=None):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

class Bar:
    _fields = ['x', 'y', 'z']

    def __init__(self, x, y, z=None):
        for field in self.__class__._fields:
            setattr(self, field, locals()[field])


The method in Foo is very repetitive, you have to type each attribute name three times, it gets quite exhausting doing this in classes with even small number of attributes and names not so lengthy.

On the other hand, the method used in Bar is way shorter, but has the draw back of constant warnings from the IDE's stating that there's 'unresolved references'. And also this method doesn't allow using the dot operator functionality in the IDE's to auto-complete the attributes.

I'm looking for what to do to create the classes not repeating attributes names all over and still be able to use some functionality from the IDE's.

I'm using PyCharm as my IDE, but I would happily change to any other if there's support for what I'm trying to do.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

  "On the other hand, the method used in Bar is way shorter"


Not really... In your example it is the same number of lines and WAY more characters.  Of course, this might not be the case if you're passing LOTS of arguments to the constructor, but... once you start having too many arguments in the constructor then you're about due for a refactor to figure out how to cut down the number of arguments anyway...

Use the first version.  Your future self/collaborators will thank you for it1.

1Actually, your future collaborators probably won't know to thank you... I suppose it might be more accurate to say that your future self/collaborators won't hunt you down to make your life miserable for writing hard to read code :-)

Title: How to close (in code) a Form which the IDE has open, without closing its associated .Pas file
Description: 
    
    
                    
The code below is simplified from something I'm doing in a design-time .BPL for D7.

Update:  Since posting this, I've found one way to do what I'm after, namely just send the form a WM_Close message, but I'd still be interested to know whether there's a more "official" way to do it, because using WM_Close seems like it has the potential for wrong-footing the IDE.

All I'm trying to do in this code that's causing me the problem is to close all files open in the IDE,
and then open a specific .Pas file that happens to have an associated .Dfm file.  I don't want the form defined in the .Dfm to be open on-screen, so I'm trying to close it, without closing the .Pas file too - I just want the IDE Form designer and this form out of the way.

Eventually, I found out how to get at the form via OTA + NTA services in my .BPL's code and, naively but for want of any other obvious way to do it, I've tried calling .Close on it, by this snippet.

AForm := TForm(INTAComp.GetComponent);
AForm.Close;


However, the form does not close.  I've traced into TCustomForm.Close from the CPU window
and evidently the reason it doesn't close is that its Visible property is already False.  This is what evaluating Visible prior to AForm.Close returns, too.

Evaluation various other of its properties prior to AForm.Close tells me that
- its Owner is Nil BUT
- it has an apparently valid window handle //  Arrghh! [sound of penny dropping... see update above]

I dare say that this is something to do with how the IDE's form designer works.

My question is simply:  What do I need to do in my code to get the form to close,
as it does when I simply click its [x] button on its frame?

Btw, I've confirmed that the instance of the form I'm getting via AForm := [...] is the
instance that's on-screen, by changing on-screen instance's caption in the OI.

All it needed was:

SendMessage(AForm.Handle, WM_Close, 0, 0);
//AForm.Close;


But I'd still be interested in knowing whether there is an official way to do this, because
my "solution" feels like it's doing an end-run around OTA and NTA services.  Otoh, the user can always close the form manually, on-screen, so maybe I'm worrying about nothing

Description: 
    
    
                    
Lets assume I need to debug some Java compiled code which provides debug information. So I can't change this code. For example I have 

SomeClass object;
object.doAction1().doAnotherAction().doAnythingElse();


So I wanna inspect an object which doAction() returns and its fields. I know there's an evaluateValue action in most IDEs but I don't need to call method twice, because it could make changes that can't be undone. I don't care which IDE (Eclipse, Idea, Netbeans... ) to use, or even pure jdb. Probably there's an appropriate expression that fits into lots of languages debuggers, not just Java.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using Code::Blocks IDE which is open source IDE providing multiple languages.
It is using GCC compiler.

I want to do line by line debugging of program.
Have you any about that? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use the "Step Into" command in the "Debug" menu which should start debugging and stop at the first line. Then continue through using the "Next Line" command (also in the "Debug" menu).

If that doesn't work as intended, you can set a breakpoint (by clicking in the left 'gutter', or 'margin') at the first line of your app, and start the debugger from the "Debug" menu, and then use the "Next Line" command in the "Debug" menu.

The shortcut keys vary based on your settings but should be listed alongside the menu command, and makes 'step'ping easier.



Since you're using gcc to compile, you can specify the -g parameter to include debugging symbols, and invoke gdb from the a command shell with the compiled binary as an argument: gdb &lt;yourapp&gt;. 
(If [n]curses is installed, specify -tui for a more pleasing interface: gdb -tui &lt;yourapp&gt;.

Once in gdb, the command start will start debugging and stop automatically at main(). You can then step thru with the step command, and quit to exit.

You can always man gdb...

I was wondering if there is a way to keep the "Find" window open in Codeblocks IDE (I'm using v13.12 if that's relevant). I'm talking about the window that usually opens (in any IDE) when you hit 'cntrl + F'. In Codeblocks it keeps closing everytime I hit 'Find'. I would rather it stay open like in Eclipse, Notepad++, and so forth.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I normally use the "Find in files" function instead of the normal Find function.

When pressing Ctrl+F select the second tab in the window and you will find "Find in Files".
Normally I use the scope "Project files" which limits the search to the project only.

After a search you will be provided with all the results in the bottom log window in the tab "Search results". You can then easily click around on all matches and C::B will jump to the file and location.

Title: Using C++&#39;s namespace{} sort-of like C#&#39;s #region/#endregion
Description: 
    
    
                    
I work on a C++ project that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. As a result it's not uncommon to be working on the same part of code in Visual Studio one day, Xcode the next, Qt Creator the next, etc. 

Lately I have taken to using the namespace{} keyword in much the same way that #region/#endregion are used in C#. For example:

// MyFile.cpp

namespace MyNamespace
{
  // lots of code related to one class
}

namespace MyNamespace
{
  // lots of code related to another class
}

namespace MyNamespace
{
  // lots of code related to yet another class
}


While this doesn't allow me to name the regions per say, I still find it very helpful being able to collapse large chunks of code. I know that IDE-specific solutions exist, such as #pragma region/#pragma endregion but I was unable to find a way that was IDE agnostic for C++. Also, I know that these large chunks could be put in their own files, but for the purposes of this question please assume that this is not an option.

My question is: does this create any overhead in the compiled binaries? Can doing this impact performance negatively or impact the end result (binary) at all? 

(Note: We use Microsoft's compiler on Windows, clang on Mac and gcc on Linux.)

Thank you!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The short answer to your questions are "no". Follow long answers:


  does this create any overhead in the compiled binaries?


No. Assuming you were already using the namespaces, the impact is absolutely zero. If you weren't previously using the namespace, there is a small impact in the size of the mangled identifiers to link.

This:

void identifier() {}        
namespace longnamespace { void identifier() {} }


Become the symbols _Z10identifierv and _ZN13longnamespace10identifierv, respectively. If you have a huge project, with hundreds of thousands of symbols, it may affect (albeit slightly) your link time and your dynamic-link (loading) time.


  Can doing this impact performance negatively or impact the end result
  (binary) at all?


Yes, at least in terms of loading times. But not a lot. And there are solutions to mitigate it (google for "prelink" and "prebinding").

Title: C++Builder XE5 debugger shows ??? for watches and function&#39;s parameters in the Call Stack
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm having a lot of trouble working with the C++Builder debugger. I'm using the latest version, XE5, with all patches and updates.

The symptoms are more or less the following: I can run my app and debug it fine once, but if I close the app (either "correctly", or resetting the program in the debugger), the next time I run it it would usually just show ???? for the watches values, and the call stack will show the call stack, but the parameter's functions will usually show also ???.

Closing the IDE and opening again is the only way I've seen to "solve" this. I have tried rebuilding the whole project group, or similar stuff, but that doesn't help.

I'm running on a Windows 7 Pro, 64bits VM, with 6 Gb RAM, 3 processors assigned, plenty of free HD. No strange stuff running on the background: no antivirus, nothing at all except the IDE, Notepad++ and SourceTree. Closing everything except the IDE doesn't help either.

The app is a VCL 32bit app, the project group consists of about 12 packages and 2 exes. I use runtime packages and dynamic rtl. The projects are all new, I mean, the were not updated from projects of previous versions of C++Builder: all of them were done from the beginnning here.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Apparently, if you disable the "Load All Symbols" in the Debugger section of the Project Options, and just add there the modules you do want to be able to debug into, the problems are somewhat mitigated.

Doing so has made my Debugger session behave correctly, showing the values for the inspectors and not hanging.

[Update, July 2016] The newest version, 10.1 Berlin, appears to have fixed this most of the time. I haven't had this problem occur to me except for maybe 1 time in a couple of months now.

Title: Issue linking libxml++ and glib libraries with CodeBlocks IDE for C++ Windows
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am writing a C++ app for Windows using Code Blocks IDE. I am interested in using the following XML++ library: http://libxmlplusplus.sourceforge.net/

It requires libxml2 and glibmm-2.4 libraries. I downloaded the source for each of these libraries and included all of the headers into my project by right clicking on "Build Options" ==
Answer 1: 

    
    
Are libxml2 and glibmm-2.4 built?

You can find prebuilt windows binaries for libxml2 here. I can't find prebuilt windows binaries for glibmm, so you'll either have to download the entire gtkmm installer, or build it yourself.

After this process is done, you should have files such as

libxml2.lib
libxml2.a
libxml2.dll


Depending on you compiler (GCC or MSVC), and the desired linking method (static or dynamic), you should choose the required library files. 

In Code::Blocks you do the linking via the "Linker settings" tab, accessible through Project -&gt; Build options... -&gt; Linker settings. Click add and select the previously compiled 
library files (libxml2, glibmm-2.4 and libxml++) using the folder browser.

Update: I am able to successfully run the project on my Windows 8 64-bit PC.

I have a MinGW-64 installation from MinGW-builds (GCC 4.8.1). The only other thing I had to download was the gtkmm-win64 installer. I chose the "full installation".

The search directories in the project build settings were:

C:\gtkmm64\include
C:\gtkmm64\include\libxml++-2.6
C:\gtkmm64\include\glibmm-2.4
C:\gtkmm64\include\glib-2.0
C:\gtkmm64\lib\glibmm-2.4\include
C:\gtkmm64\lib\glib-2.0\include
C:\gtkmm64\lib\libxml++-2.6\include


The import libraries to link to were:

C:\gtkmm64\lib\libxml++-2.6.dll.a
C:\gtkmm64\lib\libglibmm-2.4.dll.a
C:\gtkmm64\lib\libglibmm_generate_extra_defs-2.4.dll.a


And the DLL's copied to the executable's location from the gtkmm64\bin folder were:

libglib-2.0-0.dll
libglibmm-2.4-1.dll
libglibmm_generate_extra_defs-2.4-1.dll
libxml++-2.6-2.dll
libxml2-2.dll


The executable ran successfully (excluding the fact that the program terminated due to some parsing exception).
    
    
Title: Why do internal classes have to be imported?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In any IDE, when working with a class in a package and I need to use a class from another one, I have to import it. Why doesn't the IDE just automatically import the packages so there is no need to do it manually? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
First, In Eclipse, you can use Ctrl-SHIFT-O to automatically import anything you need.

From the java package tutorial:


  For convenience, the Java compiler automatically imports two entire
  packages for each source file: (1) the java.lang package and (2) the
  current package (the package for the current file).


The IDE will not import all your packages because 1. 


You may not need them, why import them?
More importantly, you can have classes in different packages with the same name, then this will cause name ambiguities. 



  If a member in one package shares its name with a member in another
  package and both packages are imported, you must refer to each member
  by its qualified name. For example, the graphics package defined a
  class named Rectangle. The java.awt package also contains a Rectangle
  class. If both graphics and java.awt have been imported, the following
  is ambiguous.


This would cause unnecessary headache making sure you are always referring to the correct package. By importing packages and classes yourself, you can be sure that you are always using the specific class that you intended to.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Because sometimes different classes have same 'short' name so the IDE does not know which one you meant. For example if you copy-paste code into your IDE containing Date, it does not know if you meant java.sql.Date or java.util.Date. In these cases the IDE will offer you to choose from all available classes with that name.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
This is my thought. Think this way,

Suppose you have two classes having the same name in different packages like this, then how does IDE resolve the package import? How does it know which SendFormAction to be imported?
So generally IDE's give you an option to import the packages [cntrl+shift+O in eclipse IDE]
and if there is confusion, it will ask you which one to import.

com.xyz.action [package]
SendFormAction.java

com.abc.action [package]
SendFormAction.java

Never used it but heared good things about it: http://www.aspdebugger.com/
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
A code folding feature is very helpful on such problems, but only if code is quite good formatted. But code folding is of no help if the nesting takes place within a line.

All IDE and most text editors have a Match Brace command or something similar. That command is usually best to find the matching brace of a condition in a not well formatted block with nested conditions.

UltraEdit and maybe also other text editors support even customizable strings which are applied to the Match Brace feature. Perhaps this is a help for you on the not well structured ASP code.

UltraEdit has several brace matching features. But for your problem the most helpful would be the commands Go to Matching Brace and Select to Matching Brace which are both in menu Search (traditional menus) respectively Go to brace and Select to brace on Codding tab/menu (ribbon mode/contemporary menus). With caret blinking at beginning of an If the first command moves caret to the matching End If and the second command additionally selects everything from If to End If. The commands can be used also in reverse direction from End If to matching If.

But before the brace matching commands can be used on your ASP files on If and End If, it is necessary to define the string If as opening brace and the string End If as closing brace in the syntax highlighting wordfile for ASP.

To do this open in UltraEdit from ribbon/menu Advanced the Configuration by clicking on Configuration (traditional menus) or Settings (ribbon mode/contemporary menus). Open in configuration tree Editor Display and click on Syntax Highlighting. Select the language respectively wordfile VBScript ASP and click on button Open. Exit the configuration dialog with button Cancel.

In the opened wordfile vbscript.uew search at top for the lines

/Open Brace Strings = "{" "(" "[" "&lt;"
/Close Brace Strings = "}" ")" "]" "&gt;"


and append on first line "If" and on second line "End If".

/Open Brace Strings = "{" "(" "[" "&lt;" "If"
/Close Brace Strings = "}" ")" "]" "&gt;" "End If"


Save the modified wordfile and close it. The modification is immediately active and you can use now the commands Go to Matching Brace and Select to Matching Brace in your ASP files.

Inside the .project file in the root of the Eclipse project, m2eclipse will add the org.eclipse.m2e.core.maven2Nature to it. This tells Eclipse that the m2e plugin will handle various stages of the project lifecycle, and m2e has a hybrid partially-internal and partially-external engine that applies the instructions in the pom.xml to the project. (For example, it finds the classpath placeholders that are marked as maven.pomderived and replaces them with the appropriate Maven dependencies.)
