Title: Aptana autocomplete shows only local stuff
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am trying out Aptana for general PHP development, i loaded an old CakePhp project to test the autocomplete and all i can get are the local functions and variable and absolutely none of the inherited ones, which kinda ruins the whole thing. Is there a setting i dont know about that fixes this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
apparently i needed to set up a "Nature" to PHP, the default was some eclipse.something version. Aptana reindexed the file and it works now. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The original poster was correct in adding PHP to the "Nature" of the project, however he did not provide how to do it. I also had the same problem and once I added PHP to the "Nature" selection list the autocomplete provided the options for inherited classess as well.

To add the PHP Nature:


Right click on your project in the Project Explorer View
Click on Properties
In the "Properties for project" window, select Project Natures in the left list box
In the Project Natures window, place a tick next to PHP
Click on OK button


that should get you the autocomplete list.

I haven't used aptana for PHP, but since it's based on Eclipse I assume the cake folder (in the same level as your app folder usually) needs to be added to your project path. 

You can go into the properties of your project and either add it to the path or add it to the libraries. 

I usually setup my project to point to the whole folder so I don't need need to do this step, but my Eclipse installation will pick up the inherited methods just fine.

I tried to import an existing MyEclipse project in Eclipse, Galileo. Everything is fine except that I am not able to deploy the project with Tomcat6 plugin in Eclipse. I guess this is because the MyEclipse specific configuration of the project.

Maven is the way to go. All popular Java IDEs have good support for Maven projects. Maven on the other side have plugins which create project files for those IDEs

Each IDE has a different approach to things like deployment by plugins, so you might be better off doing your deploy through ant or maven, which can be called from the IDE.
    
    
Title: How do you rename a Status Bar Panel in Delphi 2010
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have just added a new panel to StatusBar1 and it is called 5 - TStatusPanel. I want to give it a different name but I can't remember how to do this.



I want to rename 5 - TStatusPanel to 5 - GripArea. As you can see from the image I have done this before (see Num, Caps, AM/PM) but I can't remember how I did this. It sucks to get old. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Just change the Text property of the TStatusPanel. This is what is displayed in the status panel editor. Of course, this will make the text visible in the panel! Normally, in code, you access the status panels using the StatusBar1.Panels[PanelIndex] array. PanelIndex is the zero-based index of the panel. I always declare constants such as

STATUS_FILE_POSITION = 0;
STATUS_FILE_SAVED = 1;
STATUS_LONG_TEXT = 2;
STATUS_ZOOM_CONTROL = 3;


and use these to remember the panels. (The code above is from my text editor.)

So I can do, for instance,

StatusBar.Panels[STATUS_FILE_SAVED].Text := 'Modified';

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Here's a tip that would have saved some hunting:  right-click on the form, View As Text.  Now you'll see the form layed out as properties, and you could have found the control, seen how the other panels were named, and fix the last one.
Alt+F12 to toggle the text view on/off.

The EGit plugin for eclipse is in incubation phase.

I'm using Git in our production for last 6 months. Although we have installed the EGit plugin for eclipse I'm not much found of that. We are using the msysgit project as the main git client along with KDiff3 as the merge/diff tool. This combination works very well for us
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
My experience with EGit is that its still not ready for any real use. My biggest gripe is that Egit tries to fit in the SVN usage model. So basically it is a crippled implementation, and therefore little incentive to switch from SVN. There are some pretty big gaps in features (no rebase) and the GUI is nowhere usable (that is also MHO of eclipse though). People complain about the git command-line, but somehow eGit managed to implement a GUI that was even less intuitive. Some other problems are:


git index is hidden, not sure if you can stage files in GUI
no rebase
no multi-branch history view
fetch/pull are buried in the menus
diffing between working copy and commits is not really implemented (except with quickdiff)
Egit and Eclipse synchronize feature do not play nice together
no way to do a git-status in the gui

I was using Haxe to solve these problems (as it gave me back a compiler), however the problem with not writing directly in JavaScript is that one has to create bindings for every existing JavaScript library.

Maybe there is an IDE that can help me write errorless code?

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm just starting learning Ruby and decided "wth, let's pick up vim and get used to it in the process". That sounded like a great idea until I actually downloaded gvim and started ... staring at it. Ok, I'm not a total noob, I know how really basic things are done in vim, what I'm looking for is how to setup vim and what plugins I need to have a complete easy-to-use workspace. I searched on the internet but didn't find anything that was straightforward enough for someone who's just starting, plus most of the articles are old.

Any suggestions guys ?

PS : Just to be clear, I'm not looking for a RoR solution, I'm using vim strictly for Ruby development, no Rails involved at all.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Code completion in vim is kind of meh. It is mostly useful when you have a gigantic variable name you don't feel like typing, it will basically just show everything from open buffers when you hit ctrl-p

For opening files, try out either FuzzyFileFinder_Textmate (this can be a pain to set up), or Command-T.Both will do recursive fuzzy searches starting from where you are.

What you really need to learn to go from beginner to intermediate is really grokking how the commands work. It is basically an extremely terse programming language.

For example, yaw will copy the word your cursor is currently in. y is the verb (will do a copy), a is the modifier (means copy the whole thing, not just from where the cursor is) and w is the noun (copy a word). Learning commands like yaw aren't going to get you that far unless you fully understand each piece. If you grok it, next time you want to delete a word, you just need to figure out that the delete command is d, and you will realize that daw will be the way to go.

Another thing to realize is how powerful . is. . will repeat any command that is in your command buffer. So, if I type daw, I delete a word. I move my cursor to the next word and hit . again, which will delete that word too. 

But what happens if I want to delete a word and replace it with something else? daw kills it, i drops you into insert mode, you type out the replacement and hit esc. Ok, but was that repeatable? a . now will just repeat the word you copied, not delete the current word.

However, if you typed caw (c will delete, then drop you into insert mode), then the word you want to replace, and esc, your inserting is rolled into the same command as the delete. That means you can . and repeat the same change at another line.

This is immensely powerful. Eventually, you learn what you can dot and what you can't, and mold your workflow around it.

To start with that stuff, I would start by :h text-objects, which will give you a rundown of the common "nouns", and a bunch of modifiers. There really isn't anything as good as actually having a vim master on hand to answer your questions though.

Are you asking for tips on using vim in general, or specifically vim with ruby? For the former, don't worry about the articles being dated; vi, which vim is based-on, is 30+ years old. 

vim-ruby is probably a good start, a lot of handy features:  http://vim-ruby.rubyforge.org/, but truth is none of it really necessary, it just streamlines your process.

I decided to start using vim to program a ruby project just like you. I guess this is really late, but check out https://github.com/akitaonrails/vimfiles.

I know that this could be dealt with using a spider and grep and things like that, but is there a professional and elegant way to do this?

Clarification: yeah, so I would like to do it statically, without debugging. So Firebug is the right way to go?

As far as IDE go, which IDE should I use? Are there IDEs that will automatically download a website with all of its javascript dependencies and then allow static searches for methods and classes?

Under Unix, Emacs is a good choice, to which I always come back, because it is convenient to have a single editor for everything, and because it's open source.

What is best for you depends on your past experience with IDEs.  I'd say: stick with what you've been using, or take this opportunity to try an even better IDE.

Note: Python comes with Idle, which is a very simple (if limited) IDE.

Be sure to check out IPython. It's an enhanced interactive python shell with a bunch of useful features such as Tab-Completion using introspection (eg, type "my_object." to see a list of its attributes and methods), logging your interactive session to an executable python-file, defining macros, etc. The documentation page has a link to the tutorial as well as screencasts showing it in action.

On my mac/Linux machines, python came pre-installed. On windows I use both jython under the eclipse IDE and ActivePython with their IDE/eclipse.   With eclipse you'll want PyDev. 
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
It all depends on what you are looking for and what you are already using. 

For instance, if you are using a more 'simple' editor at the moment: as long as it's got Python syntax you've got the basics.

If you are used to e.g. Eclipse you can just continue to use that, combined with Pydev. Besides syntax highlighting you'll also get more fancy features to help you debug and refactor your code.

Personally I use Emacs with python-mode (and a few other modes to interface with Subversion and Git). In the past I used Vim which also worked quite well.

My advice would be to start out with your current environment as long as it has some rudimentary support for Python. Once you are familiar with the language, start exploring what your environment is missing and either add it or if you cannot, switch to an enviroment which does support the feature.

Geany is a good option for a Linux setup, it's intellisense isn't that great but syntax highlighting is good and it can compile your code directly from inside the editor, plus it handles other languages such as C/C++, PHP, Java etc...

On windows I use Notepad++, but it's mostly because I like text editors instead of fully blown IDE's.

Reference wise Daniel's choices are very good places to start, also check out Green Tea Press who do free computer books, there are two Python choices on there but the "Python for Software Design" book hasn't yet been published properly although you can download the manuscript.

Is this possible?
    

        
Answer 1:

Answer 2: 

    
    
Well, between VS2005 and VS2008, this little trick used to work - not sure if it still does between VS2008 and VS2010 though (haven't had the time to test it myself).

The first line in the solution file (YourProject.sln) contains the version info which VS created the file. If it's "too high", a downlevel VS won't open it. 

First of all, MAKE A BACKUP !

Basically just change that first line in your solution file to be 

Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 10.00


Version 10.00 is VS2008 - Version 9.00 was VS2005.

Now try to open your solution in VS2008 - it might just work (no guarantees, though!!).

Marc
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If all you've done is edit the source files, the best approach is probably to send those back and have your friend re-integrate them into his vs2008 project.

If you've added files, you may still be able to get them integrated okay. What will cause trouble is if there are binary files that VS2008 doesn't know about.

I'm not aware of any tools that will automatically convert projects back into vs2008 so the re-integration may be the way to go.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
why aren't you using windiff between the 2008 sln file and the 2010 sln and see how it was before and what has been changed. It should with small modifications.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
No, because VS stored version number in solution file.

You need two different solution file. Each for VS version. But I think, this isn't good solution. Better is you convince your friend to upgrade, too.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Yes vs2008 can work with vs2010 project files just fine, the problem is with the solution file for some reason. vs2008 refuses to open vs2010 solutions and vs2010 refuses to open vs2008, so you have to make one for each.

After you have run the upgrade wizard in vs2010, close the solution. Now make a copy of it so that you have two and name the new one with a "08" suffix or something. Open that solution file in a text editor and change "11" to "10" on the first line.

Voila! Now you have one solution that will work for vs2008 and one for vs2010 and they are sharing the same projects.

Visual Studio or Eclipse - which IDE is better for Qt on Windows?
Taking into account Eclipse is free I'm especially interested in Express version of VS but I'm open to non-free versions if this would allow much better integration with Qt.

Before posting you might take a look at similar questions on SO to avoid writing what I've already read :)
Looking for in-depth answers.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'll expand on my comment asking why Qt Creator isn't on your list.

I'm experienced with MSVC, and I've used Eclipse for some C++ development on Linux and been impressed with it. Despite my familiarity with these tools, I've pretty much settled on using Qt Creator for Qt based work.

Qt's signals and slots paradigm is effectively a language extension, and one that Qt Creator makes very easy to use: there's great code-completion features while writing connect() statements that intelligently display the available signals and slots on the classes you are connecting.

The help system is well integrated, the integration with the resource editor and the form designer makes it feel a little like Visual Studio too. 

The debugger is adequate for most purposes, but lacks the finesse of debugging with MSVC - for some bugs I've had to drop back to using gdb manually. 

The other thing I'm missing is the ability to impose some virtual organization of my code files. I can't group related classes together in the project view.

But despite those flaws, I'm loving it. Check it out!

Edit: improvements to both Eclipse and MSVC support are on the Qt Roadmap. If Qt Creator really isn't for you, I think MSVC wins, particularly if you are already familiar with it.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Try Qt-Creator instead. It's still in beta but getting better each version. It may not have all the features that VS and eclipse have, but it might have the ones you need. Plus it's very tightly integrated with Qt.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I can't seem to find any of my code behind files in the class view tab. I can see other classes that I have added but none of the code behind files. Is there a reason for this? I am missing a setting or something? It is quite irritating trying to navigate my way through the code all the time.

I can see all the other classes just fine just not my code behind files.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Class View is intended to provide a hierarchical view of the "symbols" defined in your project. For website projects, it will only list the referenced assemblies and any classes defined in App_code. 

So, no, you aren't missing a setting. You're missing the point of the Class View window ! ;-) Maybe you should be looking in the Solution Explorer instead.

BTW, if you're having trouble navigating through code files, you should consider better organizing your files (in folders, for instance).

Edit (after a Bounty has been placed on this question... drool! ) :



Okay, I have VS 2005 SP1. I tried the following cases:

a. Create New Website (VB or C#):

The Class View window is blank until you add an App_Code folder. When added, the Class View window displays any classes added to the App_Code folder and the default Project references (System, System.Web, etc). It does not however display any Page code-behind classes.

b. Create New Project -
Answer 2: 

    
    
Don't be placing classes other than the class backing the page in code-behind.  Place all other code in a separate library project or at the very least in the App_Code folder.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
There should be a drop down menu right above the code. The left on is the classes in your open file and the right are members of the selected class.

Title: Creating Plain .rb Files with Aptana RadRails
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have just bought a MacBook for some ruby development and like the look of Aptana Studio as a really nice IDE.

The question I have, however, is that I want to know (before getting too deep into it, and potentially wasting time) is can I create plain old .rb files without the rails framework attached?  Also, can I execute the ruby file straight from the IDE, or will I have to use Terminal?

As I said, I am only just learning Ruby and I am working through some books I have bought, and while I do wish to get into rails soon, I feel its important to learn the language properly, before asking rails to do a lot of stuff for me.

Any other thoughts on best practices and other potential IDE's would also be appreciated.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'd recommend Netbeans (Ruby Edition obviously) or Jetbrain's RubyMine over Aptana. I've had issues with Aptana and Ruby when I tried it. Rubymine is still in public preview release status, but it will be a paid product when it's released in a month or so. It's developed by the same people who made IntelliJ IDEA. Netbeans actually works very well with ruby and rails and it's free. Both allow you to execute ruby from within the IDE and have rails support.

I've also found irb very useful, Netbeans allows you to run irb from within the IDE as well. Having code completion and inline documentation helpful when starting out.

For just fooling around with Ruby I suggested an editor, the command line, and IRB.  You will have more fun and learn more, quicker.

Answer 3: 

    
    
Yes, you can create plain old ".rb" files inside RadRails or Aptana Studio, and they don't have to be inside a Rails project or "attached to the rails framework". You can also run or debug a ruby script inside the IDE by right-clicking the file or inside the editor and choosing one of the Run As

Description: 
    
    
                    
Need some good suggestions for Cassandra IDEs, which are supported in the Windows operating system with some good documentation. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You could use one of the following:


DbSchema (not free)
DBeaver
RazorSQL
Cassandra GUI Client


All the above tools seem to have pretty good documentation coverage and seem to be live projects.

If you need some more tools and documentation, you could check this curated list of information about Cassandra.

In my opinion, still, the best Cassandra client would be cqlsh.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Visual Studio Code is free, cross platform and has a couple of good full-featured Cassandra plugins:


cql
Cassandra Workbench


You get syntax highlighting, CQL execution, schema browsing and data browsing.

Description: 
    
    
                    
require_once APP . DS . 'controllers' . DS . $this-&gt;controller . '.php';


I'm including controller. It has default value set and it always has to find something. In real world it works, but this inspection is still shinning in my IDE and I would like to solve it somehow.

Inspection says this

Path '/media/matej/space/www/rs/app/controllers/$this-&gt;controller' not found


How can I explain it, that I am aware of what is happening? Is there some comment to solve this issue?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You are using very dynamic code here .. which cannot be evaluated properly in IDE using static analysis alone (as you are using $this-&gt;controller which can be anything during run time).
Two options here:

Suppress warning for this line only -- just place /** @noinspection PhpIncludeInspection */ on a line before that.
This option makes sense only if you have very little of such suppressions in your code, otherwise half of the file will be suppression comments :)

Just turn off such inspection completely -- adding such suppression comments all the time (often) looks ugly and not a desired way in general.
For that: Settings | Editor | Inspections | PHP | General --&gt; Unresolved include. It could be done for whole project or for some custom scope only.

Because of this SO question here, I would like to execute ruby code step-by-step while running rspec or cucumber.  Not only would I like to stop execution, but I would like to then proceed through the code, line by line.  

Is there a best-practice-approach to step into code that is running while RAILS_ENV = 'test' ?  Is there any way to do this currently?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
pry-debugger allows you to step through code line by line:


step: Step execution into the next line or method. Takes an optional numeric argument to step multiple times.
next: Step over to the next line within the same frame. Also takes an optional numeric argument to step multiple lines.
finish: Execute until current stack frame returns.
continue: Continue program execution and end the Pry session

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I use pry, which opens an interpreter in your current console so that you can inspect the variables with their current values.

Just require the gem and put binding.pry inside your tests. The Readme file is quite self-explanatory, so I'll leave you to it :)

Title: How does code coloring work?
Description: 
    
    
                    
How do code coloring engines work, exactly? Do they just generate a parse tree that preserves whitespace, color the leaves, and reconstruct the original program? How does live code coloring manage to be efficient enough to do it on the fly? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Most syntax hightligters I know of do not react to the syntax tree, but just tokenize the source and color text according to which kinds of tokens it forms. The most difficult task such as highlighter has to do is recognizing multi-line comments (and/or strings, if the language allows that); everything else can be kept within a single source line.

Automatic indentation engines are more involved. In theory the best results would come from reconstructing a full syntax tree, but that is slow and raises problems of error handling (because most programs are not even well-formed while they're being edited). Instead they use various kinds of simplified scanning and heuristics, which doesn't always manage to match the true syntax of the language.

(edit: on further thought this is not completely true. For example, Eclipse's Java editor will also change the color of identifiers according to whether they name local variables, instance fields or static variables/methods. This happens in a separate pass from the basic lexical highlighting, after the editor has parsed and typechecked the code for live crossreferencing).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Syntax highlighting usually works at the lexer level, not the parser level.

It's essentially a finite state machine derived from a set of regular expressions, so it's very quick to run.

It may fix some issues, and will in fact make your IDE faster. Worth trying it.

Component issue

Could you uninstall all installed third-party components?

Answer 3: 

    
    
"Invalid pointer operation" means you freed memory that didn't belong to you. One of these three things is the cause:   


Your program freed something that had already been freed once before. 
Your program freed something that was never allocated in the first place.
Your program freed something that had been allocated with a different memory manager.

The reason this doesn't work is because you are trying to attach the disk to a
running domain using IDE architecture.  

Imagine you have a real physical server, can you open it up while it is running
and plug in an IDE drive?  No, the architecture does not support it.  KVM/QEMU,
trying to emulate this architecture, must then present the error you are
seeing: "disk bus 'ide' cannot be hotplugged."

One solution is to attach the disk using SCSI archicture.  SCSI supports hot plugging.  The command you would use would be:

virsh attach-disk --driver file vm2 disk2.qcow2 sdc

The only change is "sdc" instead of "hdc".  This hints to KVM/QEMU that you want SCSI instead of IDE, and it will attach the disk.

Also, when the domain is stopped, you can't use attach-disk because this function is meant for running domains.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Code Editors are done to death so unless you have a genius idea or just want to use it as a professional exercise, I wouldn't waste time. 

Every programmer dreams of writing our own editor and most of use attempt it at one time or the other but most of us give up owing to suprising amount of time such an apparently simple tool takes to produce. Those that don't give up eventually commit seppuku. Actual code editors are handed down from on high by divine beings because they are the only creatures with the eternal patients to get the job done. 

If you want to risk it anyway, I would suggest starting with the Introduction to Text Editing in Cocoa and work you way out from there.

However, since the real killer in Code editors is parsing syntax, you might want to look at MacRuby which will let you create Cocoa apps with Ruby. Using Ruby would help greatly with parsing because large scale parsing in Objective-C is a death march. There are also some public domain parsers written in Ruby for TextMate

Answer 1: 

    
    
See here:
http://www.wingware.com/doc/edit/helping-wing-analyze-code

Your IDE (Wing) doesn't know for sure what type of objects are in cars, but you can tell it what car is with an assert statement and it will do autocompletion exactly how you want it to.  You can view it as casting the type for Wing's eyes only if you like.

class Reader:
    def __init__(self):
        """Constructor"""
    def ReadCarNames(self,cars):
        for counter,car in enumerate(cars):
            assert isinstance(car, Car)        # this trains Wing
            print str(counter) +' '+ car.name  # autocompletion will work here


or if you don't want that assert firing off all the time, you can wrap it in 'if 0' logic that Wing's SourceAssistant picks up but python will not execute.

if 0: assert isinstance(car, Car)


You currently cannot tell Wing that a list/tuple/etc only contains one type of object and what it is, but it is in their plans and will use similar syntax.

The IDE does not know the type that is being returned from enumerate, and therefore cannot perform autocomplete in that situation.  It also does not know that the cars list contains Car. 
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Due to the dynamic nature of Python, it's impossible to know what type an instance is, or even what attributes it has, without running the code. For example, your Car instances don't have a name attribute until they are instantiated, so even if the IDE somehow knew that car was a Car instance, it would have a devil of a time figuring out what attributes it would have statically.

It depends on your IDE, but some IDEs (such as the IDLE that comes with Python) will give better results after you run your script. In this case, though, probably not.

Title: Getting back into C++ (tools, debuggers, environments, compilers)?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm going to be using a subset of C++ (working within some of the ideas in Elements of Programming), but I haven't used C++ in years. I'm going to be writing a highly parallel algorithm on a 100+ nodes system with shared memory. The nodes are Mac OS X, but I have access to *nix and windows machines, too.

Do people have suggestions for editors, debuggers, etc.? (I'm assuming I should use gcc as a compiler?) I'm not sure what sort of environment to put myself in to do this. What's the standard industry environment? Even better, what's the best FOSS conglomeration? (I'm a graduate student.) I'll be calling STL and possibly some third party code, too.

Suggestions from here?

Answer 1: 

    
    
On Mac you could use XCode, it's free.

But if you want a cross-platform IDE (Windows/Linux/Mac OS X) take a look at Eclipse and KDevelop.

GCC (C/C++) is available on all these systems.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Ordinarily I'd recommend either TotalView or DDT for debugging parallel programs.  However, so far as I know neither is implemented for Mac OS X.  Mac fan though I am this is a compelling reason for running Linux on a cluster or supercomputer.

If you had Linux on your cluster I'd also recommend a parallel profiler such as Intel's ThreadAnalyzer or Allinea's OPT (same link as above).  Again, for serious parallel development this sort of tool is a must.  Fiddling around trying to analyse parallel performance or figure out reasons for poor scaling with tools designed for serial programs is a waste of time.

I'm puzzled why a graduate student feels constrained to FOSS.  The universities I know best (only a couple I admit) all have all sorts of commercial compilers and other tools.  I'm not a big fan of GCC.  Even less so am I a fan of having only one compiler; the more compilers you have access to the more you will learn about what they can do.  In my experience the compilers which generate the fastest code are generally not the ones which produce the best diagnostics.  I like to have both at different stages of development.

As for IDE -- I use Emacs.  Nuff said on that.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I want to create applications in windows that has complete portability (within windows OSes of course). I have tried using one application written in Visual C++ but I had a real tough time in making it run in other windows OS (like it required .net framework libraries to be installed). This put me on the back foot because I had to copy a set of DLLs from one machine to another and most of the time something works some does not.

And I am TOTAL amateur in writing windows based applications since my technological forte is mostly Java. Where to kick off? (like which tools/IDEs to begin with since I am seriously into writing my own utilities/tools).

I am open to clarification should you guys feel my question is vague/blunt.

You can use .NET, and if you stay in 2.0, use standard components, it should work fine. You may need to make a few changes to work anywhere, buy very possible.

http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page

You could either use Visual Studio or the free IDE. Sharp develope or Mono Develope.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Visual C++ should be easily able to do what you want.  It sounds like you created a C++/.NET project, which will generate a dependency on the .net libraries. You need to choose a different project type when the wizard starts up.

If you have a paid version of Visual C++, you might try clicking on "MFC Application". A lot of people are down on MFC these days, but it's still a quick way to get a C++ Windows app off the ground.  Make sure you choose the option to statically link the MFC libraries, or you'll have another dependency.

MFC isn't included in the free version of Visual C++, so you'll need to go old-school and work directly with the Windows API or find another package such as QT or Wx to link with.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If you really want it to work on every version of windows your best bet may be to go the route of full cross-compatibility.  Grab the Boost, QT, and possibly ACE libraries and stay away from making OS calls directly.  There's a free version of Visual Studio which is probably what you want for an IDE for personal development, if you're doing commercial stuff then get the full version.  
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Why not use Java. The JVM is on more systems then .NET and now your app will work on any OS not just windows. Plus java is easier for a beginner then C/C++ and less chance that your program will cause BSODs.

Take a look at this blog post I made, which shows you how to write a cpp program in emacs. If you want tab completion you also need to learn to generate and use tags, and the M-/ button. 

When programming using emacs however, you do more than emulate Developer Studio or Eclipse. Learning to use keyboard macros, and program in elisp, will empower you to write little utilities that take a few minutes to write and save many times that in drudge work.

Emacs is an editor, not an IDE.  It has a ton of 'extra' features and is very configurable for an editor - but it's really not meant to be an IDE.  If you want an open-source IDE you might want to check out Eclipse.

Having said that - you can compile from within emacs in a number of ways:
1. Just open a shell in another buffer (M-x shell) and compile from there.
2. Set up a Makefile and use the M-x compile

I'm sure there are complicated ways to get the other behaviors - but you'd probably be better off using a real IDE.

Title: Needed: Light and free HTML editor with source control support
Description: 
    
    
                    
We're not doing real web development. We get our HTMLs from our designers, and have our web app generate those HTMLs (with some specific content). Simply put, we don't use any major web development infrastructure (ASP, PHP, JSP etc). Having that said, we sometimes do need to edit HTML, JavaScript and CSS files, and I'm tired of using rocks and stones and having no proper backup. What I'm looking for is a rather simple editor that would handle those kinds of files, and most importantly - will support source control, and will be free (or very cheep).

I've been looking into Aptana, and it seems to be a bit of an overkill. It has a lot of features we can do without, and this makes it too heavy. VWD express is lighter, but has no source control integration. There are probably a million other HTML editors, but I couldn't find one that satisfies the basic requirements - relatively lightweight, supports source control and is (almost) free. Any suggestions?

Eclipse is pretty good.  It's also very popular among developers and can edit HTML.

Why is supporting source control a requirement?  I find that the place for good source control is not in the editor.  The editor just gets in the way and only implements a subset of functionality.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
NetBeans can edit about anything, is free, cross-platform, and directly supports CVS, Subversion and Mercurial version control systems. It's not exactly lightweight, although it is lighter than any comparably featured competitors I'm aware of.

Title: Why do I need to restart Delphi 7 to get the debugger to work sometimes
Description: 
    
    
                    
At least 4 times a day I need to restart Delphi to get the debugger to stop at breakpoints again. Sometimes I can trick it into working again by attaching to the process after a rebuild of the code. But most of the time I can't and it is costing me a lot of time to go back and re-open all the files that I want.  

Nearly every time this happens I do get some sort of Fatal Error when trying to close Delphi.  Is there any fix for this? I've got the "latest" Delphi 7, running on WinXP with plenty of memory. Most of the other guys in my office get this problem too. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Our experience with Delphi 7 is similar to yours: Fairly constant crashes within the IDE, with abstract errors, invalid pointer references, and exceptions in the VCL library. 

It seems to depend on the complexity of the project you have loaded: Our main project is a 200,000+ line program with multiple MDI forms and third-party libraries. Virtually whenever we'd exit Delphi we'd have to deal with catastrophic fatal errors. We got very adept at using the task manager to hunt down the Delphi32 process and kill it -- virtually the only way to get out sometimes.

We've since upgraded to Delphi 2009 and it has significantly better stability. My feeling is that Delphi 7 has numerous bugs, and you will either have to live with them, or upgrade.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
While you are debugging, do you exit the program normally, or do you use the IDE to force debugging to stop / kill the application?  I have found that using the IDE to force the application down causes problems after a while (resolved by restarting the IDE), while exiting the program from within the application causes no such trouble.

Caveat: my experience is with Delphi 6.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I've had this in D7 too - but really only with one particular project (admittedly very large, many many forms and home-brewed custom components). Other projects (some equally large) were fine.

My feeling was that it was somehow related to using frames and/or forms that were subclassed from other frames/forms, where you would have the descendant form open in the IDE/debugger but not the ancestor form. 

Because, just like you, I felt it was a monstrous pain to shut down and restart the IDE half a dozen times a day, I took the trouble to create a .DSK file for the project, that had all the parent form stuff in it, so that when Delphi started-up that project it opened all those other forms 'automatically'. Once I was sure I'd got the contents of the DSK right, I made the .DSK file read only...!

It meant that the editor would 'forget' which files I had open at the time, but at least it would always automatically open up all the stuff that seemed to make the IDE 'behave'. If I was going to be working on a particular handful of files for a few days, I'd just manually add them to the .DSK file. 

I seem to recall that Delphi would make some passing complaint about the file being read-only, but this method took away about 80% of our daily pain.

And then the other thing I did was to have the Task Manager load up, minimized, as part of my system startup. At least then it was a simple case of ALT-TAB to get to something that could kill the IDE. :-)
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Okay, following on from my pervious response in this question, here's a sample DSK file. I can't post this as a comment to my response otherwise I would. :-)

There's really nothing much to them, they're quite straightforward and a glance through this ought to help you see this. I'd actually advise that you just load up Delphi, switch on the 'autosave desktop' option (it's in Environment or Editor, I forget which), arrange the IDE as you want it (with the various source files open, etc), then save/close the project. You will find a MyProject.dsk (etc) file in the project directory - just make that read-only (or follow the advice in the article you linked to in the comments, and make a backup copy of it somewhere that you can always bring back whenever you need to).

Anyway, here's a sample DSK to give you an idea of what you're playing with. They are just INI-type text files, you can hack them in Notepad if you so wish. :-)

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am currently using Eclipse for Android development and have been for a few years.

The page for Android Studio says "Android Studio is the official IDE for Android application development..."

Another page says, "you should migrate to Android Studio to receive all the latest IDE updates".

What do these statements mean for the ADT plugin for Eclipse and how urgent is it that I migrate to Android Studio?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
For years, Google employees and daredevil programmers were using an "unofficial", beta version of Android Studio that was deemed not ready for the general public. In November 2014, Google launched Lollipop 5.0 on the Nexus 6, and alongside it, a version of Android Studio that is considered stable enough for the average developer, which they refer to as "official".

While the Eclipse SDK manager continues to provide the latest API platform packages, the ADT toolset for Eclipse is no longer being maintained. I believe the last stable release was in July 2014. Only Android Studio will receive the ADT tools updates. It means you can still continue using Eclipse for a year at least. But over time, the ADT tools for Eclipse will get outdated, and only Android Studio will receive new updates.

Over the next few months, the official documentation and examples will also be updated to support Android Studio. Many companies in the US and Europe have been using Android Studio for a long time now, so you can expect your clients to demand all existing as well as new development to be done using the new IDE.

Further considerations:

NDK integration with Android Studio is still pretty painful. Eclipse may be the only viable option for most NDK devs till the NDK integration process with Studio is improved.

It means that going forward, Google will be working primarily on Android Studio, not the ADT plugin. Google will also not be providing much (if any) support for developing apps in Eclipse moving forward.

You can keep using Eclipse for the foreseeable future without any real problems. However, I wouldn't expect new developer tools to become available to you. For example, a lot of the new features in the Android Studio layout designer will not come to Eclipse.

While upgrading isn't urgent, I highly encourage you to try out Android Studio and try migrating so that you can at least see what is available in Studio and find a migration plan that works for you.

I just updated my SDK to 5.0.1 and as i restarted the IDE and then came across this error statement. This comes when i open the activity xml. The UI in it does not load. I tried deleting the SDK folder and then again updating it but still got that error. I am really unable to see the UI in the 5.0.1 api. I tried restarting the PC and again setting the JAVA_HOME but still didn't work. I am using Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit. I am not sure what i am missing. Any help would be appreciated.

If you're using Eclipse, then go to the graphical layout page of an XML layout file and look near the top where you see the dropdown menus of what device you can use or what orientation your app will be in. (landscape or portrait) There should be a dropdown with the Android logo that lets you select the API to use.  Be sure that 19 or lower is selected.

Title: Why won&#39;t Delphi XE2 let me embed a font resource as RCDATA?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I would like to embed a .ttf font resource into my EXE and dynamically load it. This particular method expects the resource to be of type RCDATA. So, I go to Project &gt; Resources and Images... press Add..., and pick my .ttf file. The resource type FONT is automatically selected with an identifier of just 1. I change the type to to RCDATA and type in my own resource name. 

Problem: When I press Ok I get an error that the identifier of a FONT resource must be a numeric value. But it wasn't FONT type anymore, I had changed it to RCDATA.

How do I get past this problem?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
(asking and answering together because I'm sure others have seen this problem)

It seems to be just a small bug in the IDE. When you first select your .ttf file in this resource screen, change the type, press Ok without changing the identifier (leave it 1). Then, open the same screen back up, change the identifier to your own, and press Ok. It only works if you close and re-open the Resources and Images screen.

You could of course also write your own .rc file and do everything manually without this screen.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Unlike Jerry says, you can simply "load" the font file in the Resources and Images... dialog. Once you selected it, you can change the type to RCDATA (combobox an the lower right) and if you have done that, you can change the name to whatever valid name you choose. 

There is no need to close and re-open the dialog. 

I tried this in XE2 and in XE7, and it works as expected. The FONT type is merely the default for, well, font files. That can easily be changed in the dialog.

This doesn't look like a bug to me. Just plain default behaviour when you load a font file. Just like there is default behaviour when you load a .pas file in the editor.



If you want to use an .rc file, it is quite easy to generate one in the editor (new text file with extension .rc) and then you can add it to your project. The IDE will take care of the rest. No need to do anything manually there either, except of course editing the .rc file.

This is command line tool. You need to first create tags for your whole source code and then you can jump to defination of any function or variable.



In eclipce IDE

You can go its defination by using F3 and come back using Alt + &lt;-

If you do not want to use F3 then press Ctrl and move curcer to that place and click on that...you will go to its defination.

How to go to a certain place in the source code is IDE-specific and not related to the programming language, so your question doesn't make any sense. 

Many C compilers support Eclipse. 

In Eclipse, you do what you are asking for by placing the cursor on the item you are interested in, then press F3.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
In addition of the other replies (notably mentionning ctags), and if using a recent GCC compiler (i.e. gcc, g++, preferably version 4.8 or 4.9, etc....) you could use the MELT plugin and DSL.
MELT enables you to work on the internal representations (such as Gimple) of the GCC compiler.
In particular, MELT has powerful pattern matching facilities, and a command line interface to find particular Gimple patterns. So for example you could, with a few command line arguments to gcc, find all the calls to malloc with a constant argument bigger than 30 bytes. This requires working on the compiler internal representations (e.g. because of sizeof operators) and is not possible in a purely textual tool.
For finding occurrences of identifiers, you could use grep  or also the ack perl tool.
The tools mentioned here (ctags, grep, MELT, ack) are command line tools. It is up to you to configure or adapt your IDE (or editor like emacs) and/or your builder (like make) to invoke them.
Remember that compilers are command-line tools, at least on Linux
PS. I am the main author of MELT.
    
    
Title: Eclipse IDE &mdash; how do I put my external .jar files into a lib folder?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Eclipse IDE - Can someone please tell me how I can group my external .jar files into a C:\lib folder? I'd really like have them all in a lib folder and not taking up vertical space in the root of my project (see attachment).

I have read some of the similar posts here and tried them but my projects still are not 'seeing' the needed .jar files! It's very frustrating.

I know how to add a Folder but how do I tell Eclipse my .jar folders are in c:\lib so my projects will execute? I'm not even sure if making a lib folder in my project is even related to the fact that my jar files happen to be in c:\lib.

Thanks...

Answer 1: 

    
    
From your description it sounds to me like you want the jars to stop taking up space in the root of your project. I am not sure how you initially added them but if I am adding external jars this is what I usually do:

Right click on your project, select properties, then Java Build Path, and then click the libraries tab, click on add external jars and then you can select each one individually (which would be a pain) or you can select them all at once if they are in the same folder (hence the c:/lib). Click OK and it should add them into a Referenced Libraries folder like so:



Also, when you open the libraries tab initially, if all of your jars show there, remove them before proceeding as you don't want to import them twice into your application (If that's even posssible, not sure).

Edit

Switch to Package explorer:

Click on Window 
Answer 2: 

    
    
That is just eclipse's way of displaying what libraries are on the build path of the project. It doesn't mean that they are on the root of the project, those are just references to those jars ( that maybe any-where on the system ).

A good practice is to get all the jars required by your project and put them in a folder. Next, you can either declare that folder as a library from eclipse and add that library on your build-path or you can just add the jars directly. But they will still be displayed like you are seeing them already. The true path of where these jars are located will be written next to them (like you can see in the attachment C:\selenium....).

There is a way to do that?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can't use a variable in the Designer, but you can in the code. So set the Color in your code. I think you want to take a look at the TextBox Events, you should change the Color under the desired Event. For Example OnTextChanged:

Private Sub TextBox1_TextChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    'Change color here
End Sub


EDIT:

You could change the TextBox Color in here:

Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    'Change Color here
     TextBox_Game.BackColor = Color.FromArgb(97, 31, 28)
End Sub

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
This should do the trick.

string strCol = "97-31-28";

private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    TextBox_Game.BackColor = Color.FromArgb(Convert.ToInt16(strCol.Split('-')[0]), Convert.ToInt16(strCol.Split('-')[1]), Convert.ToInt16(strCol.Split('-')[2]));
}

Title: Writing C (and variations) on a Mac, and Exporting to Mac AND Windows
Description: 
    
    
                    
So I was just told that it's not the easiest thing to write an Objective C program on a mac using xcode that can also be run in windows (because xcode utilizes mac-exclusive libraries).
I'm not too picky about the language I use because I'm just learning, so is there an easy way to program C/C#/C++/Objective C on a mac that can be (easily) exported and run in Windows?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can compile Objective-C code for Windows on a Mac using MXE. But I assume you're interested in GUI applications, not just pure, standard Objective-C code. In that case, you will need a cross-platform framework. For example Qt (MXE comes with Qt). But that's a C++ framework.

Objective-C for GUI applications is pretty much only used by Apple. If you want better portability of your applications, you should probably use C or C++. Python is another language you can use, if dynamic/scripted languages are your thing. Python also supports Qt, so you can write GUI apps with it.

The reason I recommend Qt over all other frameworks is that it doesn't just give you a GUI library, but it also gives you other classes that make it much easier to write cross-platform applications (for example an easy to use, Unicode string class, and classes for portable file I/O, networking, threading, etc.)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Look into cross-platform GUI libraries.  Objective-C is largely associated with Apple products, so I doubt you'll find much cross-platform there.  

For C#, the Mono project may be a good place to start:
http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page

For C++, you can start by looking at Qt and Wx.

Depending on how much effort it is, you can also try separating out your GUI and trying to use  some GUI scripting languages like Tk.  This has the advantage that you'd have more leeway in your main language.

Title: How to port from C++ Builder?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have this large program written in C++ Builder, relying heavily on the VCL graphics library. For many reasons, I want to abandon this tool. There are a couple of alternative compilers to move to, I'm open for any of them. 

What I wonder is how one would do the actual porting, step by step? Has anyone done this and could share their experience?

I would imagine that step 1 is to separate the GUI/VCL from the application. The program should have been designed like that anyhow, but sadly it isn't. That alone is a major project, but where do I go after that? Should I link up the VCL GUI in .dll files, include them in the new compiler, but maintain them from Builder if needed?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I would start -- as you say -- by separating the presentation layer from the business logic. Start by doing this in the familiar C++ Builder environment: remove the business logic from the application and recreate it as one or more separate modules (DLLs, on Windows), and change the presentation layer so that the program still runs but accesses these modules for all business logic operations.

Then you can rewrite the application without using VCL. You might stick with C++ and use another GUI library (Qt is certainly one of the options, wxWidgets is also worth a look) or you might want to change language (depending on your own skills and preferences) for the presentation layer.

Another attraction to moving the business logic out of the presentation is that it then becomes much more easily testable.

I'd recommend taking a look at Michael Feathers's book Working Effectively with Legacy Code before you start. He gives a good (and very test-based) approach to this sort of refactoring.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I agree you should separate the presentation layer from the business logic. 

If you're looking for an alternative GUI framework to the VCL, you could consider Qt. It also comes with an IDE that has a UI designer (so is comparable to C++ Builder), but with the advantages of being both cross platform and open source.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I had the same situation with MFC once. my advice is start from scratch and reuse whatever you can from old code, and don't mess presentation with logic this time! ;)

Actually, contrary to everything I've seen - mostly the "Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true", which is mentioned in a number of places, it is actually setting it to false that fixed the drawing issues(for me at least).  Go figure.

RDP is optimized for native Windows apps and, regrettably, newer versions of RCP (like Vista/Win7's default RDP) is even more hostile to non-native apps than older (XP/Server 2003) versions.  Here's a good link:

Another is to:


Select "32-bit true color" in your Terminal Services settings

Reduce screen resolution (heck, use 1024x768 if possible)

You should give JavaWIDE a try. It is an IDE designed for access to a JDK without it installed on a system, with a built-in storage system so you just need access to the internet. It's not exactly a program for accessing everything on the computer but it will do a good job with your programming. It may take a while however, as the compiling is done on a separate server.
