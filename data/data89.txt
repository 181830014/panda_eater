Title: How to change formatting options based on solution
Description: 
    
    
                    
My boss set our IDEs up to use non-standard formatting. For example, it adds spaces between the parenthesis and parameters. This is fine for the new stuff that we've started from scratch, but it's super annoying when I go into existing projects and try to format the code with Ctrl-k-d because when I go to compare the file with the latest version before checking in my changes it looks like I've changed almost every single line in the file and it's difficult to pick out the actual changes.

I would like to be able to use his settings in the newer development, but switch to the default settings when working with other projects. Is there a way to accomplish this without having to go into the settings and uncheck/recheck all the appropriate options every time?

EDIT: I understand it might be good to reformat all legacy code to use the new standards. Unfortunately, that's not my decision to make. And even so, I sometimes work from my personal computer which I also use on occasion to do contract work for other companies. I obviously can't reformat their code to fit my bosses standards.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The Rebracer extension stores code formatting options alongside each solution and when you open a solution, Rebracer will automatically apply that solution's settings.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can easily switch between settings, by creating separate .settings files and using a VSIX package to switch between them by loading them into Visual Studio - I use this for switching between Dual and Single monitor settings via menu items in the Tools menu.

Using an extension is annoyingly complex for such a simple operation, and this was a whole lot easier when Visual Studio supported macros. However I've uploaded my homebrew extension to GitHub in case you want to have a look.

The tricky bit is editing the settings files to only contain the ones you're interested in, which I expect are the ones in Text Editor\C#\Formatting\Spacing.
    
    
Title: Android studio 1.x AVD not running?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm a newbie android developer ,since i upgraded to Andoid Studio 1.x from beta ,things became a lot easy , creating the AVD and managing SDK is managed better by the IDE now ,

I used the Default Nexus 5 config to setup an AVD,however can you please tell me how to safely turn it off ,I cant find any poweroff button , i have Intel HAXM set up and working fine, I got an error saying AVD instance aldready running etc asking me to delete the avd from user/android/avd/... which i did ,

WHen i created it i can run it just once, when i close and reopen studio and try to run again i get the following message 

AVD Nexus_5_API_21 is already running.
If that is not the case, delete the files at
   C:\Users\S****\.android\avd/Nexus_5_API_21.avd/*.lock
and try again


And what system image to use for the AVD, whats the difference between the ARM ,ATOM 86,ATOM 64 and googdle API images for the same android version, i use a windows 8.1 PC 64Bit running on a vt-x suported intel core i5 , 4200 u processor , which image should i use ,

Please Note i couldnt find solutons elsewhere and i doubt its an offtopic question as its about setting up a programming tool.
Btw the task manager shows a 32 bit emulator running

Answer 4: 

    
    
make sure sdk and avd manager added to your IDE correctly.
answer of your second question is,when you play your app in IDE a emulator will be run and on emulator toolbox you can turn off or turn on your emulator and  also you can see your app running or not
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I meet this situation today, but the file *.lock was deleted (not by me) when i run this emulater failed with error tips like

AVD Nexus_5_API_21 is already running.
If that is not the case, delete the files at
   C:\Users\S****.android\avd/Nexus_5_API_21.avd/*.lock

so in the end, i duplicated this emulator and located the copy emulator's location and find the .*lock file and then i deleted it and it worked.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes, you can use grunt which is a task runner written in node, grunt has a plugin called grunt-contrib-livereload that reloads the page whenever there are changes in the files/directories that you want to watch. Alternatively, there's a scaffolding tool for client side web applications in AngularJS called yeoman, that has a generator called generator-angular - this generator has an opinionated structure towards AngularJS application development and it comes with a basic setup that you can use for livereloading code changes from any files that you have configured to watch.

You can do this in many ways. Many of the options are already mentioned in this post. All of them are workable. In my experience the most simplistic way to do this by the following way.No configuration , No setting , No need to code anything.
Just add this line in your &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; tag of the html file

&lt;script src="http://livejs.com/live.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Title: How to compile Java code without an IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am a beginning programmer that has been using an IDE to learn to code. However I want to try  using a text editor to see which one I would like more. My question is, once you download a text editor, what tools do you need to compile and run a program and how do you set them up?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You just need the JDK. Installing it (it has an installer) should set it up sufficiently.

When you want to compile something, use the javac tool:


/prepcode/code/ppre
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you want to use a text editor for java programming don't forget to add java to your Environment Variables Path. You can check if java is already added to your path by running java -version in your command line. If you get nothing you have to add  C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0; to your path (your version of the jdk may be different, change it to the name you have). Don’t forget that semi-colon ; at the end.  

Now you are set and ready to compile and run java programs just as explained by @T.J. Crowder in the answer above.

Answer 1: 

    
    
I can suggest you Ctrl-Alt-H in eclipse. This is the closest option to what you need. Press this shortcut on your field and you will see all call hierarchies that Eclipse can see. Then select the root element in hierarchy, right click and choose "Copy Expanded Hierarchy". Paste this into text editor. Now search for method2.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The following is possible (only) in the just released IntelliJ IDEA 16 EAP:


Invoke Call Hierarchy on method2
Browse the hierarchy tree to show all methods you are interested in
Invoke Find Usages on the C.param1 field
Edit the Find Usages Settings to Include overloaded methods and search in the Scope Hierarchy 'Callees of method2'


This will show everywhere in the hierarchy the C.param1 field is used.
    
    
Title: Why does the Eclipse Android IDE get so slow and laggy after only a small amount of use?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using the Eclipse Android IDE, downloaded from the Android site (ADT v22.6.2, Mac, OS X).  

When I first launch the program, it is quick to open new files and make modifications, but very rapidly slows down and becomes quite laggy.  Opening project files becomes so slow that one wonders if the IDE crashed or froze-up.  Editing said project files is equally painful...  

For example, clicking into a non-fucused window/tab to insert the cursor takes a solid 5-10 seconds or more of delay before it appears and modifications can be made, and saving files can take up to 10 seconds or more (for a single file).

Why is this?  Why does it start off nice and quick, but so rapidly degrade in performance?  Restarting ADT will bring the speed up a bit, but each successive launch of it brings the overall performance down to the point where only restarting the computer can bring it back up.

I've had similar issues back when I was coding in MatLab and using their WYSIWYG GUI builder.  Eventually the system got bogged down with all the components being drawn on the screen that it would freeze up and you'd have to restart the software (and sometimes the computer).

Eclipse is very powerful, and I'd be lost without it, but it would be nice to maintain consistent performance from it without multiple software and system restarts.  Is there a fix, or is everyone succumbing to the same problem?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
hmmm... So you can do 


disable the Android Package Builder (right-click on project#Properties#Builders)
use ant for build and deployment of apk.

see android-workaround-for-slow-building-workspace-problem-in-eclipse for details


2.ADT 21 pre-dex all libraries. This means regular compilation only re-dex the output of your  project (faster) and then merges the result with the pre-dexed libraries (pretty quick).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The only way to be sure is to actually look at your system, but I suspect that the cause is that Eclipse's heap is too small.  That will cause two things to happen:


It will run the GC frequently, and that will directly cause it to be laggy.
The fact that Eclipse is short of memory means that it is likely that cached information about (for example) code that you are currently looking at will need to be discarded.  Then when you next need that information, Eclipse will need to reload or recalculate it ... contributing to lagginess.


The cure this is to change Eclipse's heap size.

Answer 1: 

    
    
The color theme is the same as used by the completion method Elpy uses. If you upgraded to the current release of 1.5.1, that would be company-mode. In theory, this should already work correctly with a dark-background Emacs. Try setting frame-background-mode to dark first — maybe Emacs did not detect your background correctly (though it should). If that fails, you can change the colors ("faces") it uses by doing M-x customize-group RET company RET and look for options with "face" in their name.

Changing the order of the completions is a bit more tricky and would require changing some code within Elpy. I created an issue for this request.

I just built a game in Java, and I want to make it so that it can be opened on any other computer without using an IDE or command line or something of the like. Basically, I want it to be like those computer games you download from the internet and start playing.

I'm sorry if this is a stupid question (or an impossible question), but english is my second language and I don't know any other way to put it. Basically, I've gotten pretty good at making video games, and I'm about done with my game, but I don't know how to make it so the game can run without an IDE. Namely, I want my little brother to be able to double click on an icon which will cause the game to start up.

Now, just approaching this logically, I'd assume whatever computer the game will be running on will need to have Java downloaded (like the JDK) or something, and I'm ok with that. I just want to be able to give someone who doesn't speak or read english a simple icon to double click on and play a game.

If this is impossible without some industry grade developers, please let me know, since I know some of the bigger games out their use their own version of a language to make the game work. I just want to know if this is possible for someone like me to do, and if so, how. Thank you for your time!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You're looking for a "runnable jar". When you create the jar, you use a manifest file that says what the main class is (the one with the main method). That looks like this:

So for instance, suppose your game is implemented in the package myniftygame and the class that has the main is GameMain.

The manifest file (here I'm calling it manifest.txt) would be:

Main-Class: myniftygame.GameMain

Then to build the jar, you can use the tools in your IDE or build script, or from a command line in the parent directory of your myniftygame directory:

jar cfm MyNiftyGame.jar manifest.txt myniftygame/*.class

(That slash would be a backslash on Windows.)

Then, in any modern OS with a JRE installed, double-clicking the .jar file or making it the target of a shortcut, etc., will make the runtime open the jar, see the manifest, and call the myniftygame.GameMain.main method.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You need to build an executable jar file. A double-click on this will normally simply kick off the program, provided you have a Java runtime installed.

Note for this solution you will have to package all third party libraries into your jar, such that you have one file. But generally it's the simplest solution.

An alternative is to make the program available via Java web start. In this scenario you can click on a hyperlink, and your installed JRE will download your program and all packaged libraries, and launch that locally. The advantage is that your program updates will be identified and downloaded each time someone runs your program. The downside is that you have to host the Web Start files yourself.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Create a runnable jar or better still use executable wrappers like Launch4j. Executable wrappers do provide features like standard windows installers and will prompt you to install JDK/JRE if not already installed or you can even bundle a JRE.

Title: What is this TFS icon and how does it differ from a folder icon?
Description: 
    
    
                    
What object does the following icon represent in TFS and how does it differ from a standard folder you might create within a team project?



I hate asking such a question but I've read around and honestly can't work it out. I've checked in the directory on my disk I have the project mapped to and it's seemingly no different to a usual folder.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It means that it is a branch and not a regular Tfs folder. Branch folders were introduced in TFS 2010 and provide some additional functionality such as support for visualization. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms181425.aspx
    
    
Title: Can I create C++ and Java projects within the same version of eclipse?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I learnt to program using Java in eclipse. Recently I've wanted to learn C and C++ so I installed the C/C++ version of eclipse. I still have some Java programming to do though and the option to create a new Java project has disappeared.

Is there an easy way to have both C++ and Java projects accessible on eclipse or should I find a new IDE to code Java in? If I was to reinstall the Java version of eclipse would it remove the C++ version?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Eclipse is a platform, you can most certainly use it for C/C++ and Java at the same time. The development tools for each language are actually just plugins. That said, many people prefer to use separate installations for each language, so as to keep their workspaces clean. 

If you want to install the Java tools in your C/C++ IDE you can go to Help &gt; Install New Software..., and search for "Java Development Tools."
    
    
Title: Delphi - how to customize IDE layout
Description: 
    
    
                    
Delphi 2010 - all patches, Win 8.1 64 bit.  Reinstalled EVERYTHING... windows,etc, so functionally a new machine.  Installed D2010, then installed GExperts and CnPack Wizards, as I had used them both before a really liked them.

I have 2 monitors, so I changed my layout to Classic Undocked.  The default is to have the component palette at the top right of the Delphi main window.



In my previous release, I was able to change the HEIGHT of this window to double whatever it is now, and drag the palette UNDERNEATH the glyphs from the File / Edit / Search area, so that way my component palette went across the whole screen.  For whatever reason, I cannot do this now.  When I move my mouse to the BOTTOM of the delphi window area, I get the "expand window up and down" cursor, like I should, but the window refuses to increase in height.  There is some setting preventing me from increasing this windows height, but I can't find it.  What setting am I looking for in order to be able to increase the height, so I can drag/drop my palette to the bottom LEFT corner of this window?

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The size of the main undocked window cannot be modified by resizing it manually. It is sized so that it is exactly large enough to contain its children. So, you can do what you want by moving the component palette to the desired location. When you do so the main window will increase in size so that the component palette fits.

Judging by your screenshot, your toolbars are drawn in a way to indicate that they are locked and cannot be dragged. That's not functionality that is present in the plain vanilla Delphi IDE, so I suspect that you have used functionality from either GExperts or CnPack to lock your toolbars. Obviously you'll need to unlock them in order to move them.

Finally, I should point out that the inability to resize the main window vertically is not new. Classic Delphi versions (e.g. Delphi 7) behaved in exactly the same way. So I think that the fundamental issue is not related to a Delphi version upgrade, but rather is related to you having locked your toolbars.

Description: 
    
    
                    
The "other java proposals" that allows you to use the Ctrl+Space shortcut is missing from my Kempler install.  I have redownloaded and reinstalled fresh from Eclipse and still do not have access to the shortcut from "other java proposals".

When searching here it's been suggested it should be checked in the advanced section of the editor preferences for Java.  I can't find anything about how to enable to disable it here or in the Eclipse help files so I thought I would ask. 

Thanks,

Answer 1: 

    
    
Kepler doesn't have "Other java proposals" but just Java Proposals. 

This option (or Java Proposals (Task-Focused)) is sometimes left unchecked when importing the project to Kepler from a workspace on an older version of eclipse. Hence, your problem might be with workspace than the eclipse dist you are using.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I just thought I would "answer" this question incase someone else had the same problem.  

It turns out that Synergy+ uses the same keystroke to lock screens.  Even when it's closed, and the service is still running it holds on to key binds.  

So, how I fixed it was to go through task manager and kill processes one at a time until I was able to use the shortcut, then went in to Synergy and changed the keybind.

I'm trying to do a find and replace in many php files in aptana. To ease my job i did a regular expression that finds what i need but replacing does not work.

This is what exactly I'm trying to do:

 Replace _e("This is a sentence.");
 with    _e("This is a sentenct.","mydomain");


This is the regex i use for finding matches:

\_e\(\"([\a-z-]+)\"\) --&gt; it works


This is the regex i use for replacing the matches

\_e\(\"([\a-z-]+)\",\"mydomain\")    --&gt; It does not work, 


This is what It replaces with:

_e("([-z-]+)","mydomain");  --&gt; bad result


EDIT: Also, i need my regex to find special characters like ă, ș
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You seems to have not very well understand how replacement strings work. A replacement string is a normal string without regex symbols inside. The only difference with a literal string is that you can add backreferences from your search pattern.

Example:

search:  (_e\("[^"]*")\)
replace: $1,"mydomain")


pattern details:

(          # open the capture group 1
    _e     # literal: _e
    \("    # literal: (" (literal parenthesis must be escaped since it has a
           # special meaning in a pattern (to define groups)) 
    [^"]*  # all that is not a ", zero or more times
    "      # literal "
)          # close the capture group 1
\)         # literal closing parenthesis


$1 in the replacement string is a backreference and refers to the content of the capture group 1 from the search pattern. Note that the closing parenthesis is not escaped since it has no special meaning in a replacement string.

(Don't forget to check the .* checkbox in the search/replace dialog box)

Description: 
    
    
                    
In this example. I'm using Phpstorm Code Editor and I wonder the purpose of this Vertical Bar


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is a visual limiter of the line length.
Usually the code convention in programming languages or in particular project requires to have the line of code to be limited by length.
For example Python's PEP 8 coding convention requires it to be limited to 79 characters. 
So basically this limiter in your text editor or IDE is just made for convenience to help you to control the maximum line length in your code. Usually you can set-up the maximum code line length in the settings.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am aware using 'Find all references' I can find every 'mention' of a variable - but is it possible to refine this search by only showing code that assigns a value to the variable in question?

For example:

var test = 1;
var test2 = test + 3;
test = 123;


Find all references with 'test' as the criteria would show all 3 lines.

The search I am after would show me only lines 1 and 3.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
How about test\s*=\s*.*;? Use the find feature in the IDE and make sure regular expression is checked.

This will search for test followed by any amount of white space followed by = followed by any amount of white space followed by anything followed by ;

It will fail on multiline stuff though; e.g.

test = \
123;


and the rather flashy trigraph sequence:

test = ??/
123;


although I'm not certain C# has either of these constructs.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there any way to add the build number in the code? (i mean the compiler/ide/other itself adds/maintains the build number in the code while compiling)? I want to display this build number for viewing (hence traceability of the code).

Does any one know how it can be achieved in keil software with tortoise svn?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can have your Makefile compute the build number (for example from source control tool) and then pass it from the Makefile to the compiler using -D option (for gcc for example):

gcc -DBUILD_NUMBER=\"$(BUILD_NUMBER)\" -c file.c


and then in your source file have something like this:

static const build_number[] = BUILD_NUMBER; 

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Subversion, through its keyword substitution facility, has the capability to write a build number into a source file when it is checked in.  I expect other source control systems have a similar feature.

I've got a webpage that selects a custom-made Raphael radio button immediately after the page loads. I'm trying to verify that the appropriate id is selected using Selenium IDE 2.0.0 and FireFox 20.0.1.

I've tried the following...

|getEval | javascript{selenium.browserbot.getUserWindow().jQuery('.response-options.selected').prop('id')} | |


...but I simply get null as a result. As a test, I've tried...

|getEval | javascript{selenium.browserbot.getUserWindow().jQuery('#item-responses-A1_1a_No').prop('id')} | |


...but I still get null, even though I can run...

|assertElementPresent | #item-responses-A1_1a_No | |


...and pass. Interestingly, if I run...

|getEval | javascript{selenium.browserbot.getUserWindow().jQuery('.response-options.selected')} | |


...(without the .prop('id')), I get an "object Object".

Does anyone know how to get an element property with a JQuery selector? I've seen solutions posted that involve a user-extensions.js helper function, but it seems like that is really just a convenience function that lets you use JQuery selectors using less text.

Thanks!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
assertEval is what you're looking for.  First though, you'll have to store a reference to the jquery using a store command earlier on.

Here is an example:

&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;store&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;this.browserbot.getUserWindow().jQuery&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;jq&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;assertEval&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${jq}('.response-options.selected').prop('id')&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;**the name of the ID you want to match against**&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Just in case it helps others, I wanted to just run javascript (including jquery statements in my page) and the accepted answer (1000s kudos to you Scottingham !) is the starting point. You just have to redefine $ sign with jQuery from getUserWindow !

Then add a runScript command, with in the target the following :

javascript{var $=this.browserbot.getUserWindow().jQuery; ... your javascript there}


For example

javascript{var $=this.browserbot.getUserWindow().jQuery; $('#myid').click();}


and remember that selenium only sees  what is ctually visible on the page... and so do your jquery selectors in that context

Good test coverage is going to be your best way of making sure you've captured everything when you make changes like this.

Do a search in STS for this field and clean up.  This is better than manual.  Also, read #1.

Yes, you run into undefined behavior:

if(abs(old_x - new_x) &lt; EPS) // if the difference between the last and this iteration is insignificant, return the value as a correct answer;
{
    return new_x;
}
else // if it isn't run the same function (with recursion YAY) with the latest iteration as a starting X;
{
    /*return*/ newton_theorem(new_x); // &lt;&lt;--- HERE!
}


Missing a return on the else branch. 

We could try to explain why Qt works (its compiler automatically puts the result of newton_theorem in the return registry, or shares registries, or whatever), but the fact of the matter is anything can happen. Some compilers might behave the same on subsequent runs, some might crash all the time.

The single most performance improvement I've made with all my projects is to move my toolkit VM onto a Solid State Drive. 

For best results, upgrade your laptop system disk to SSD but if downsizing is out of the question, box a 60G SSD into a external case, hook it up to an ESATA port, and blaze through your compiles. USB 3.0 is a suitable substitute for esata but uSB cannot sustain the same peak throughput.

Title: Drag component to create another one
Description: 
    
    
                    
In all major Java IDEs, there is a GUI designer.
When we select a component (A Jbutton, for example) and move it to a JPanel or JFrame, how is it done?
Is it a copy of the dragged component that is created on the other container?

On a project I'm working on, I have some JButton I would like to be able to drag to a panel. Theses JButton represent some actions, like "copy file", "move file", etc...
When one of those JButton is dragged, some options of the action will be displayed.

Answer 1: 

    
    
It's certainly possible. You'll need to study the Drag and Drop tutorial. In particular, you may want to implement Drop Location Rendering, discussed here, to symbolize the action.

By encapsulating a button's name, icon, listener, etc. in an Action instance, your importData() implementation can easily use setAction() to change the target button's behavior dynamically.

An alternative approach might be to add your buttons to a JToolBar. In normal mode, clicking the button evokes the Action; in editor mode , clicking the button changes the Action, again via setAction(), to one chosen from a list. 
    
    
Title: How to get only some files to the Eclipse &#39;Package Explorer&#39; tree (for Scala)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I find the "Package Explorer" or "Project Explorer" (are they the same?) in Eclipse Juno weird. In IDEs s.a. Visual Studio and XCode, I can select which files are "in the project" and thus shown in the IDE tree view. With Eclipse Juno, I get all the files and folders up there, and many of them are irrelevant.

Here's a picture.

I only want the files within src, src/math and lib to be listed. Specifically, these should go: Makefile, Installing...rtf, build.sbt, test, target, project, bin, _Unused_.

I was expecting there to be an option 'remove from project' (by right click) but all I get is the chance to really delete the file/folder. What's going on here? Or is it just that myself and Eclipse are not compatible? :)



Addendum:

For me, the real reason not to use Eclipse became this:

Before you begin, make sure your Scala sources follow the Java convention for packages. Each package should appear in its own directory with the same name. Eclipse expects this convention to be followed when it looks for classes. 

http://scala-ide.org/docs/user/gettingstarted.html

I don't want that. Scala does not enforce that. Bye-bye Eclipse, see you again in 10 years - maybe (last time I checked you was in 2004).
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use filters to hide these files from the project (they will still exist in the project):


Right click on the project, choose "Properties"
Choose Resource/Resource Filters
"Add..." a filter
Choose f.ex. "Exclude all", "Folders", "Name matches "target" etc.

Title: Generating IDE project files
Description: 
    
    
                    
Here the scenario:

One creates a beautiful software library/module in C/++.

Now one wants to make it easy for new users to use this library/module.

So one wants to provide IDE project files where all the include settings, compiler flags and linker settings are set correctly.

One wants to provide project files for many different IDEs under different platforms such as: Linux (32 bit &amp; 64 bit), Windows (32 bit &amp; 64 bit), Mac (32 bit &amp; 64 bit), CodeBlocks, Eclipse CDT, KDevelop3, CodeLite, Microsoft Visual Studio etc.

(Assume that all the path's to the include files and library files and all the compiler flags are known. E.g. via static paths of a downloadable SDK)

So a user that wants to use this library just has to:


Install the library/module
Choose the right project file (depending on the user's OS and IDE)
Start coding
(all include settings, compiler flags &amp; linker settings are already correctly set in the project file)
(no need for the user to manually set up include settings, compiler flags &amp; linker settings)


How could one easily generate such project files from the known include settings, compiler flags and linker settings.

I have already looked at CMake (which gets very close to the final goal), but it creates an additional CMake folder to the IDE project files and also doesn't copy possible example source into the build directory.
(maybe is it possible to get CMake to generate project files without the CMake folder and with copying the source files into the build folder?)

(all include settings, compiler flags &amp; linker settings are already
correctly set in the project file)
(no need for the user to manually
set up include settings, compiler flags &amp; linker settings)

It's possible only if your project has no dependencies. Otherwise, you can't know where deps' libs and headers are located on the user machine.
CMake have been created exactly for this - finding dependencies and generating project files.

but it creates an additional CMake folder to the IDE project file

If you are talking about the binary dir, then it can be located anywhere, not necessary in project dir.

and also doesn't copy possible example source into the build directory.

It's possible with configure_file function, or by running ${CMAKE_PROGRAM} -E copy.

Answer 1: 

    
    
The Android SDK comes in a version for Windows, and that includes the Eclipse IDE; it includes a device simulator on which you can run the created code. If you add the Android NDK (Native Development Kit), you also get ARM crosscompilers. The Android simulator/emulator is actually a QEMU for ARM, it executes native ARM code.

In short: Get the Android SDK / NDK for Windows, and you'll have all of what you ask for - Eclipse IDE, ARM simulator, ARM crosscompiler/assembler.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Both Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 allow you to write ARM assembly code and interactively debug it on an emulator or device. The only limits are that the emu/device must be Windows CE 4/5/6 and the compilers only support the ARMv4 and ARMv5 instruction sets.

Let's say I make a module called mylib.py. In eclipse I type

import mylib


Then I type mylib. and hit CTRL+SPACE. This should suggest functions/variables in mylib, but it doesn't do anything.

Answer 1: 

    
    
In order to get completion for custom modules, PyDev has to index it (if possible) and introspect the classes, functions, variables and imports defined there. To do so, you should add your module to the eclipse's PYTHONPATH and then reindex your venv (the one defined in PyDev).

Most of the times this is done automatically by the IDE but it doesn't work quite well (at least it is not perfect). 

I really suggest you not to rely at 100% on the IDE completion.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Any way to replace visual studio's usage of msbuild and still get error reporting in the IDE?  I think I might want to compile in VS with NAnt or Rake or PowerShell, or something that is just as smart but uses a scripting language instead of XML.  My build is fairly straight forward -- find all the .cs and compile them and put the dll in a Debug/ or Release/ etc.

I'd like to add a number of other steps that just seem easier from the command line:


Like hit the server to prime certain caches.
Compile with Closure
Minify CSS
Generate some metrics after build (in a certain config)
Run NUnit (or custom) testing framework and send an email
etc....


However, I'd still like to get the "error on line" feed back inside of the IDE.  Is this a possibility?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You could write some extension for Visual Studio (Macro, AddIn, Package, etc.) that can augment Visual Studio to let other build tools run. The simplest form is probably just using "Tools\External Tools.." and add your Build Tool there. As long as you format your "build messages" as described here, the should show up the output window as if they were generated by MSBuild.

However, I don't think it is possible (nor desirable, BTW) to completely replace MSBuild in Visual Studio. 

Visual Studio not just executes MSBuild.exe and parses it's output. The integration is very tight and a lot of GUI aspects rely directly on the content of the MSBuild file. 
For example, when you change some project properties in the Visual Studio UI, the changes are (eventually) written to the MSBuild file of the project.

Also, there are some performance improvements, for example Visual Studio "replaces", so to say, the call of csc.exe (the C# compiler) from an MSBuild file by using an in-process compiler, which safes some compile time, because less external processes need to be launched (also described in the above mentioned document)

While all this, from a architectural point of view, is quit likely wrapped and encapsulated by some "interfaces" inside Visual Studio, I haven't yet found a way to have those "interfaces" implement something else that, for example, uses NAnt behind.

Anyway, I think even if technically possible, it would not be technically feasible.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
For rake, check out Rake Runner extension. You can run the rake tasks from the solution explorer and check the errors and other output in the Output pane. I have little experience developing vs packages so if anyone want to help, the project is open sourced here.

Title: How to speed up sluggish tooltip symbol and expression evaluation in Delphi 6 IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
A project I have been working on for several years apparently has gotten so large that the tooltip evaluation of symbols and expressions when in design mode is very sluggish.  Despite having a quad core with 4GB of RAM (only 3 GB is relevant since it's Windows XP), when I hover the mouse over code items the tooltip look-ups can frequently take 3 to 7 seconds.  Every now and then I hit some part of the code that causes a big hit on the hard drive and those can take up to 15 seconds to complete.  I can only assume that the data structures that Delphi uses for symbol tables and other code items involved in tooltip driven look-ups has gotten unwieldy.

I don't want to turn off tooltip evaluation because it is invaluable to my work.  Is there a technique or IDE plug-in that could help speed up the tooltip evaluation in the Delphi 6 IDE?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The first thing to try is Andreas Hausladen's DelphiSpeedUp. Frankly, if that doesn't do anything for you there's not much else left to try.

Oh, and for what it's worth, your Delphi IDE will only be able to see 2GB of address space since it is a 32 bit process which does not mark itself as LARGEADDRESSAWARE.

A code clean up of unused units could help. It can be done with the free / open source tools  cnWizards (Uses Cleaner wizard) and Icarus. (Icarus also shows which units can be moved from interface to implementation).

It also helps to reduce project build and link time (in one project, it dropped from 30+ seconds to 5).
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
This happens to me too.    A guy I work with has implemented his own custom code-completion system, which I am not at liberty to share, but which is pretty cool.  The closest commercial thing that I have seen to what you're asking for is Castalia, although it focuses on speeding up code-completion, rather than code-insight and tooltips, I believe it does both.

Note that my experience is on much newer versions of Delphi. In my opinion, Delphi 6 and Delphi 7 code completion can't be much improved upon except by abandoning Delphi 6 and Delphi 7.

You might find that adding all your units to your project .dpr file and reducing and eliminating as many folders from your search path, and your library path as possible helps.  Also, you might want to make your component folders all use a common DCU output folder, and keep only that one DCU-based folder in your library path. That always speeds up Delphi 6/Delphi 7 for me.

I'm on OS X 10.7.2 "Lion", and I'm developing a C program that has to use some OpenMP 3.0 specific functionalities. Therefore, gcc 4.2.1 is not enough for me, I need gcc 4.4 or better.

I downloaded MacPorts and easily installed gcc 4.4. Running it from the command line just works fine, and compiles my OpenMP 3.0 C program with no hassle.

But it's quite annoying for me to edit the source in Xcode or TextWrangler and compile it from the command line. So I tried Code::Blocks, which took me 1 hour trying to make it work under OS X, but it crashes anytime for no reason. Then I tried Eclipse, but it sticks on using gcc 4.2.1 even if gcc 4.4 is installed and can be run from the command line. Finally, I tried MonoDevelop, which uses gcc 4.2.1 as well and I just can't see how can I force it to use my favourite gcc version.

What I'm kindly asking you is: is there any decent C/C++ IDE for OS X that I can use which will let me to specifiy what gcc version to use (just like Code::Blocks under Windows) without horrible workarounds and/or breaking gcc 4.2.1 (I need it up and working for Xcode)?

If you want to be more specific, you can edit a specific project's preferences, for instance:

You should be able to use your gcc with Xcode, without breaking the existing gcc toolchain.  Follow these instructions (which describe how to use a custom clang build, but the same principle applies to gcc).

I'd like to run different projects on a single JBoss AS in IntelliJ IDEA (different projects, not different modules). All the projects should support hot deployment.

I know how to do that in Eclipse, but I've got no idea of how to do it in IntelliJ IDEA. Is this even possible?

IntelliJ IDEA module is the same as Eclipse project, see the FAQ. Having multiple modules in one IDEA project allows you to deploy several modules at the same time to the same server.
    
    
Title: Back up MySQL using phpMyAdmin

I have used MySQL for my application written by PHP. After a time its data will be great and I need to make a backup from them. Also, I need I can restore the backup data whenever I need. My question is if phpMyAdmin can make backup and resotore it secure and completely without any data lose?

(I have both MyISAM and innoDB in my database structore)

Also, if you know any other IDE to make backup and restore it without showing the database structures and tables to the end-user, please tell me their names.

Thank you.

If you're running MySQL on your own server you may copy the database folder, but the MySQL server would have to be stopped first. Anyway I'd recommend dumping the databases through phpMyAdmin (export function) or via the command line (mysqldump). Using the latter, you may write a batch script that also compresses and encrypts the content of the dump file.

Using the built in Import and Export? The only data loss would be everything after the backup until the time the backup was imported. 

Securely? That's an entirely different topic. There's too many things to consider to call anything secure but if you're using https or on a trusted LAN, then yes, I guess it's secure.

I think MySQL Workbench can do exports and imports.

If would you wish to backup MySQL database more securely and periodically without loss of data to remote server or local drive (local hard disk or mapped drive), then you can try Vembu StoreGrid http://www.vembu.com/, a leading backup software trusted by more than 2700 service providers world wide. Once you configured single backup by selecting entire database then automatically newly added database will be backedup on upon next backup time. Also, StoreGrid backups only the incremental bytes of changes on next incremental schedule.

Vembu has a solution for almost everyone, just check them  below:

For Service Providers : StoreGrid Service Provider Edition
For Business/Offices : StoreGrid Professional Edition
For Home Users: Vembu Home
For Resellers who don't want to have their own storage : Vembu Pro
For Hosting Providers: StoreGrid Hosting Provider Edition (yet to be released)

For your requirement, we would suggest the Professional Edition http://storegrid.vembu.com/online-backup/network-backup.php of StoreGrid. Try it!!!

Title: PHP IDE upload changed files to remote FTP
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have project on the remote server and a copy of it on my localhost. Each day, when work is done I'm uploading project from localhost to remote server using Dreamveawer's sync function. It defines which files where creared/updated/deleted and updates them on the remote host.

Today I've changed Dreamveawer to more comfortable PHP IDE (phpDesigner) and there is a problem, there is no function to upload only changed files to the remote FTP server.

How can I do this? Maybe with the help of SVN or something else?

P.S. On development machine I use Windows, on remote host - *nix

Might I suggest a different approach? It's not exactly syncing your stuff automatically per se, but it is a good method of keeping everything kosher across the board. Would help with the issue of overwriting something in either direction. It will also give you a history to revert back to should something go wrong after hours of coding, only to find out you just made a mess...

My suggestion would be something like Git, GitHub in particular. Of course GitHub has a open source mentality so anything you put up there will be publicly available unless you are willing to pay for a private account. On the flip side, there is the option to setup your own personal private git server either on your hosting server if you have those type of privileges or even locally on a spare drive. Though setting up git is kinda hairy sometimes depending on which route you go. There's also SVN (Subversion) same concept, different style of doing it.

All around both are good ideas in my book. So many pluses. I believe also there are scripts or APIs with GitHub that you can use to run through something like a cronjob on your hosting server again if your host allows it. that you can just have run every day, week, every 12 hours? whatever. that can check to see if there's anything new, and if so apply it.

I am for that rsync option if you have it accessible. But setting it up on your local machine depending on what OS you have might be tricky in itself. Otherwise, there are some commercial products you could purchase that have the ability to run over your project directory and remote directory that you could purchase and act similar to an FTP. These require SSH I believe though in most cases.

Personally I have tried a few FTP programs in my time that claim syncing, have also attempting to use DreamWeaver's ability. But I don't like them; they cause more headaches than they were worth in most cases. All in all, I would go the git or svn route personally.

Does your host support rsync? That would do the trick very nicely. You also need support on your development machine; this is easily available on Mac and Linux, and can be had on Windows with some fiddling (search for cwRsync for the latter).

If that option is not open to you on your host, do at least switch to SFTP if it is offered. It is more secure than FTP, since the password/data is not sent in plain text.

Edit: yes, you can do this with Subversion - do you know that the host supports the svn command?
