Title: Execute C on a split screen in vim
Description: 
    
    
                    
When I execute a C program in vim using :!./%&lt;, I would like to be able to see my code (on the left side of a split screen), as well as the stdout results from the execution of the program (on the right side of the split screen). At the moment, the output of the program execution is blocking the view of my code until I hit ENTER, but then I can no longer see the program output.

How do I execute a C program in vim so that I can see both of its code and its execution results together on a split screen ?? I tried piping the output using :!./%&lt;|vert copen, but failed. I am using Linux.

Any help will be much appreciated.

IntelliJ sometimes moves the cursor on default positions, like over the Find button when you do a Find in Path.

However recently it is moving my cursor to completely random positions. I suspect this is because of my multi-monitor setup.

A computer/IntelliJ restart doesn't fix the issue.

Title: How to import *.xml code style into Webstorm IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am setting up my local workspace at the moment and I was wondering whether I could use the code styles found here (https://github.com/google/styleguide) inside my Webstorm IDE.

When trying to import code styles Webstorm asks for JSCS config files. I have no idea what they are.

Is there a way to import the *.xml-files as code styles?

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
there is no way to import arbitrary XML as a new code style in WebStorm. WebStorm stores its own code style settings in .xml files, but format is different from the one used in https://github.com/google/styleguide. So no, there is no way to import these style guides in WebStorm.
Starting from version 11, WebStorm supports importing a subset of code style options from JSCS - see http://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2015/08/maintaining-consistent-code-style/
    
    
Title: why dont IDE&#39;s offer built in code timing like break points?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I find timing my code for performance to be a bit of a headache and I have to assume this is a common problem for folks.

Adding in a bunch of code to time my loops is great but often there is more overhead in adding the timing checks than adding a parallel task.
making a loop parallel can take seconds whereas adding in timing chunks requires several lines of code and be dangerous if forgotten.

So... My question is why dont IDE's include this ability to time chunks of code like a break point?
Something like i mark a section of code and tell it to dump the timing output to a console with some options to make it more readable. averages and such.

I know break points can seriously hamper performance but there must be an easier way to time specific chunks of code then to write all my own timing routines for each chunk of code i want to check. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
First, VS 2015 does offer timing indicators while debugging.



But I say don't use it for serious profiling purposes. Use it to get a very rough idea of what's going on.

Timing anything in a debug build yields unreliable figures, because of many factors (disabled compiler optimizations, disabled JIT optimizations, nop instructions everywhere, breakpoints, etc). Garbage in, garbage out.

Just do your profiling properly, it's a hard thing to get right. And use a real profiler for that if you need detailed performance data.
    
    
Title: formatting error with Eclipse Mars
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using Eclipse Mars to write my Java code. When I use Ctrl-/ to comment some lines and then apply Ctrl-Shift-F to format them and then un-comment the lines, it turns out to two lines of code instead of just the original one:

System.out.printf("%s =&gt; Cowz Testing: testing Add a Representative\n",
new Date());

Instead of that, I wish new Date()); to be at the end of first line.

Edit: The right sequence of steps to reproduce my error have been perfectly described in Jonah Graham's answer.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
(I can't see exactly the error you have faced, but I have seen something similar.)

Starting with some code like this:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.printf("%s =&gt; Cowz Testing: testing Add a Representative\n", new Date());
    }


Then, comment out the printf line, so it now looks like this:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
//       System.out.printf("%s =&gt; Cowz Testing: testing Add a Representative\n", new Date());
    }


Apply formatting and the result you have is this:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // System.out.printf("%s =&gt; Cowz Testing: testing Add a
        // Representative\n", new Date());
    }


Uncomment the code and you have an error because the string is not terminated:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.printf("%s =&gt; Cowz Testing: testing Add a
        Representative\n", new Date());
    }


If the above describes your issue, then I recommend disabling Enable line comment formatting in your code style.

How to do it


From the Window menu, select Preferences
Select Java / Code Style / Formatter
Press Edit...
In Comments tab, uncheck Enable line comment formatting (see screenshot)





If you are editing a built-in profile, provide a new name
Press OK twice


Now when you comment out code, it will not edit the contents of comments when you format your code.

You can still use /* */ comments to have reflowed comments, i.e. for "real" comments, not temporarily commented out code.

Finally, I would recommend that you apply the code style to your projects in addition to your workspace to ensure your whole team shares a code style.

I've noticed Eclipse Mars had other bugs in formatting, for example when using tabs for indentation.

Description: 
    
    
                    
These "find any command" dialog in these IDEs/editors makes new features and keyboard shortcuts much more discoverable.

Does Emacs have an equivalent? M-x sort of works, but it's missing a hint of the keybinding annotation and also isn't quite as fluid with the autocomplete compared as these cases.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes - apropos-command, bound to C-h a. From the help page:


  Show commands (interactively callable functions) that match PATTERN.
  PATTERN can be a word, a list of words (separated by spaces),
  or a regexp (using some regexp special characters).  If it is a word,
  search for matches for that word as a substring.  If it is a list of words,
  search for matches for any two (or more) of those words.


The other help commands are also very useful - C-g ? to see them all. Similar to apropos-command are: describe-key C-h k, which describes the function bound to a key sequence; describe-variable C-h v, which should be obvious; and describe-bindings C-h b, which lists all currently defined keys.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
M-x can be nicer with good completion:



You need to install the counsel package from MELPA and bind the command:

(global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'counsel-M-x)


As you can see, the key binding is listed for each bound command. The
query is a regex (hence the initial ^), spaces are wild (i.e. .*).
Additionally, if you install smex package from MELPA, your favorite
commands will be listed ahead of other matching commands; this is
remembered across Emacs sessions (in ~/.smex_items file).

Here are some similar commands:

(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f1&gt; f") 'counsel-describe-function)
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f1&gt; v") 'counsel-describe-variable)
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;f1&gt; l") 'counsel-load-library)


Note also that you need this setting for the extra minibuffer faces:

(setq ivy-display-style 'fancy)

Title: Could ReSharper highlight errors instead of underlining them?
Description: 
    
    
                    
R# has two ways of notifying me of problems in my code. One is highlighting the whole text, which I love and which could be seen from the far end of the room:



And the other is ugly curly underlining:



And so far I haven't found the color which make the second one at least close in its visibility to the first one. It's just invisible on the dark background.

I also know that first one (nice) is called Resharper Error Highlighting and the second one is Resharper Underlined Error Highlighting.

Could R# always be nice and highlight the errors so I could see them?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Unfortunately, you can change the colours for the underlines, but not how it affects the text, because it doesn't touch the text - it only draws the underline.

(And I've kicked off an internal discussion as to why we have two different ways of showing errors.)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Class names are colored as classes, methods as methods, string as strings, and so on — and if some word does not look like any of those, then R# paints it red to indicate that it can't understand the reference. Once the reference is known, it gets colored after to its kind.

If there're further errors, they're wavy-underlined without spoiling the text color. There might be looong highlightings, and usually we don't want the text under them to look all plain red. Also I believe the errors shan't be standing out too much, or they will distract from the text one is trying to correct. Why, if the error is under the caret, you'll see it anyway. And if it's not, you often don't care looking at it until you jump there with Alt+PgDn or Alt+Shift+PgDn or by clicking the error indicator at the top-right corner.

What is the scenario for seeing all the errors?

Making the wavy underline brighter is a viable option though. Should we have an option to make the line thicker? Or maybe make a transparent red overlay?

Description: 
    
    
                    
Which text editor allows to search all files in the project, without a need they to be opened? 

For example: When I'm using Visual Studio and I open project Ctrl+F allows searching into all of the files in the current project. That's for ASP.NET projects.

I want to be able to search in my PHP project. I'm using NotePad++, but when I want to search into all the files, I need to open all of them first, and after entering the phrase to choose Find All in All Opened Documents. But now my project is getting bigger and bigger, and I want to be able to search into all of the files, without need all of them to be opened as a tabs. 

Is there such an option in NotePad++? If not, can you recommend me some text editor or IDE that allows this type of searching in normal PHP project(and how that can be done)?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

the function is just in front of you:
Notepad++ offers the "Find in Files..." Option in the search menu. (It is just the third tab in the usual search dialog. )

Just enter the correct filter (e.g. *.php or *.*) and use the checkboxes on the right. Most useful is "Follow current doc", which preselects the "Directory" selection. Depending on your project layout you want to enter a constant path there and also check the "In all sub-folders" option.

I really miss the ease of this notepad++ function in eclipse. For me this IS  "grep for windows". And you have also replace functionality, so this can be a "sed for windows" replacement, too.

I have started development with Intel XDK.

I was very happy in the provided demos &amp; interesting templates along with the Intel XDK software.

But after a week, most of the built-in templates are missing.

Rich collection of built-in demos is empty.



I have tried a complete re-installing of Intel-XDK. But it didn't work.

What should I do?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The samples distributed by Intel XDK are only available when an active internet connection is used by the tool. Restarting Intel XDK or your machine may resolve the issue. If that doesn't work, I recommend visiting the Github repositories where the samples are maintained and stored at https://github.com/gomobile.
    
    
Title: Good IDE for HTML

I recently started to learn HTML from Code Academy. I have searched around a bit, but I have not been able to find a good IDE that closely resembles the one used in the Code Academy course. If anyone has any suggestions please tell me. I'm just looking for an IDE that resembles the one used in the Code Academy course.

Most devs I know use Sublime Text, me personally I use a variety of tools depending on what I'm working on.

Which are good however are as always with this type of question subject to opinion.

What's good for me, may not suit you where as something I hate may be the perfect tool for you.

One bit of advice I will give you though, learn to code raw before you go looking for an editor that has all the bells and whistles and does stuff for you.

If your just starting out and your learning HTML, one of the worst things IMHO that you can do is to use an editor that writes the code for you.

I've trained a LOT of developers over the years, and by far the ones that always performed the worst, where the ones that used automated tools early in their training.

If you learn to write code, using a very minimalist editor then you'll quickly grow to understand what your writing better rather than thinking, "oh my editor will do this for me, and I can look it up later"

For me personally I have no problems logging into a Linux server at the command line and using something like midnight commander to live edit web pages in real time on a live web site :-)

If I want the bells and whistles, and I'm on windows then Visual Studio is often my tool of choice, if I'm on Linux at a desktop then often Net beans.

Every application has it's pros and cons the best way to find your perfect tool is to just try a few and see how you feel, it's like buying a new pair of shoes, unless you try them you'll never know if their going to fit or not.

Title: Find method or symbol call in hundreds of compiled jars
Description: 
    
    
                    
I spent the last hour looking for an easy way to find symbol and method calls within hundreds of compiled jars. I tried to load them them all in the ide to use the search symbol feature but the ide does only index the ones set on public and not the calls. 
Can you think of an easy way which does not include decompiling one jar after another. I kinda have to do this quite often with different sets of jars each time.

I would appreciate any ideas that could bring me a step further. Thanks for your time.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Run javap against every class in every jar.

I would use the unix "find" command to apply a complex unzip-pipeline-into-javap against every jar file in a given directory:

find -iname \*.jar -execdir bash -c "

  unzip -qql {}       | # -l to list zip contents, and -qq to keep quiet.
    sed 's/  */ /g'   | # convert groups of spaces to a single space
    cut -d ' ' -f 5   | # pull out 5th field of each unzip output line
    grep '.class$'    | # each line must end in ".class"
    sed 's/.class$//' | # convert to java class name: remove trailing ".class"
    tr '/' '.'        | # convert to java class name: convert '/' to '.'
    sort              | # sort classnames
  #
  # And, finally, call 'javap' against each class, with most options enabled:
  #
  xargs /opt/java/jdk1.8.0_25/bin/javap -s -p -v -l -c  -cp {}

" \; | gzip &gt; every-jar-decompiled.txt.gz


The output was so significant in my test (over 1GB for 100MB of jars) that I gzipped it.   Use "zcat" or "zgrep" to examine the results.   

If you're on windows you can probably use cygwin to run this command.

Title: Android Studio IDE color scheme settings cannot revoke to default white background
Description: 
    
    
                    
I just installed the latest Android Studio beta 0.8.
Played with the Settings -
Answer 1: 

    
    

  Only the Editor area background revoked back to white, all other area such as Project explorer, Properties are still dark grey.


this is because the editor and the look and feel are different views. Changing the scheme of the editor in the Android Studio does not change the theme of the other views such as Project explorer, Properties etc.

Whenever the Darcula color scheme is applied to the editor inside File | Settings | Editor | Colors &amp; Fonts, a pop-up window would prompt like below:



Upon choosing Yes, the color scheme of all the other views is changed alongside with the editor.

So, in order to change the scheme of the Look and Feel back to its default white, you need to change the theme from Darcula to IntelliJ inside File | Settings | Appearance.



Finally, don't forget to restart the IDE for the changes to take effect!
    
    
Title: What&#39;s a convenient environment for edit-run-repeat with short Clojure programs?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been hacking away at the 4clojure.com problem set and having a lot of fun. I've done a few dozen of the Elementary and Easy level problems. 

However, my "development" environment for this work leaves something to be desired. Basically, I'm writing one-liners, either in the Leiningen REPL or Sublime Text's "SublimeREPL" for Clojure.

I'd like to be able to unpack those one-liners as I work (few solutions need to be longer than a few lines that I've seen so far, but one line is pretty condensed at least for my newbie eyes).

My desired workflow is, as I implied in the title, is to have a single file for each solution, and to be able to iteratively hack on it, save it, run it and see the output.

I'm on OS X and Ubuntu; my primary editor is Sublime Text, but I do use Emacs as well. CIDER perhaps?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Emacs with, as Charles suggests, either the Emacs Live config or Emacs Prelude (or mine).
Open a file, hack away, and run

Ctrl-cAlt-j to start up a clojure repl through Cider (nrepl's replacement)
Ctrl-cC-k to load the file
Ctrl-cAlt-n to put the repl in that namespace,
and hack away.

And if you're installing Emacs Live you might as well play with Overtone and make some &quot;music&quot;
    
    
Title: How to change multiple entries in config files
Description: 
    
    
                    
I notice in VS2013 that if I highlight text with a view to making a change, the same text is highlighted elsewhere in the file. However, I can't seem to find the option to reflect the change in multiple places when I start typing.

Is this feature just for information only or can I actually do multiple replacements by typing the change once?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is not supported out of the box.

But there is a nice plugin you can use to enable this, called MultiEditing.

H/T to Scott Hanselman :)



Also note that even in standard VS2013, you can edit multiple lines by "box-highlighting".
This is where you create a "box-selection" either by holding down Alt and dragging a box around the text, or by Alt+Shift+ArrowKeys. Then start typing and the same text will appear on multiple lines.

e.g. with the following text:

Some text to demonstrate
Some info to demonstrate
Some more to demonstrate


...if you Alt+drag a box-selection around all 3 occurrences of the word to, and then type which, it will look like this:

Some text which demonstrate
Some info which demonstrate
Some more which demonstrate


This also works with copy/paste - the pasted text gets applied to all lines within the box-selection.

It's pretty hard for me to describe here, so try it yourself!
    
    
Title: Why is method added to .java file not present in .class file after a build, or accessible after package is imported?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a project I am working on in WebSphere Integration Developer 7.0 where I am trying to reference a public method I just wrote from a different package. I have an import statement included for the class my new method is in.

When I create an instance of my class and try to call my new method, I get a standard "method 'x' is undefined for the type 'y'" compiler error, indicating my new method isn't being recognized. 

What's really peculiar to me is that when I press F3 to open the declaration of my class instance, I'm taken to the class declaration in the .class file rather than the .java file. I tried calling several other non-static methods from my class instance, which were recognized and also took me to the .class file when I opened their declarations. I have my .class and .java files for this class in the same directory. 

I have cleaned and rebuilt the project to see if that would have any affect, but still see the same behavior.

So my question is, why would my IDE open the class and method declarations in the .class file rather than the .java file?  I've never seen that before - could that be expected behavior within WID in this case, or does that suggest a problem with my environment?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Why the IDE opens the .class file

Because, that is what the IDE finds listed in the build path.

It is very common behaviour. 

For example, lets say we have 2 projects - project F and project B.

Project `F` - front end
Project `B` - back end


Now, F depends on B for its compilation but B can be compiled independently. 

So, in order to build F, we first build B and then copy the artifacts generated as part of the build in the build path of F or if we don't want to do copy/ paste, we just make F's build path point to the artifact generated by B's build.

Now, we can build F. Here, what F actually points to are a bunch of class files not the source. 

And, now if we try to access any files of B from F - IDE will intelligently open the .class file(s) for us.

Answer 1: 

    
    
To run your program, you have to call a starting or main method. This method as to be public static void and it has to take VarArgs or an Array for your arguments:

public static void main (String[] args) {
    // in here, you can do stuff like calling other functions, or creating objects

    // no checks, just demo how to use the args:
    Perlocation p = new Perlocation(Integer.parseInt(args[0]));
}


Then you can call your program via

java Percolation 5

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You need a main method in your class to be able to run it. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/application/

Then if you want to pass an argument to the main method, you call it via

java Percolation 5

Title: How can I get IntelliJ to ignore formatting with Subversion?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using IntelliJ 12 Ultimate.  Each developer on our team likes to have their own spacing (2 chars, 4 chars, tabs, etc.).

I have this habit of pressing ALT SHIFT F many MANY times as I code.  I like the way it formats the code.  However, I use 4 chars for spacing and other people use 2.

What I would like to do is prevent IntelliJ and/or Subversion (1.7) to ignore that formatting change.  The first thing I do when I open someone else's code is press the ALT SHIFT F so I can read it (habit, I know). 

This marks every line as "changed" in Subversion.

But it's essentially the exact same code.  Just formatted different.

How can I prevent this from happening?  What would be awesome is that when I opened up a file, it would auto-format but not register it as a change.  Only if I actually press the keyboard and change characters should it register as "edit", IMHO.

Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can't. Subversion doesn't understand context or formatting. Changed bytes are changed bytes.

This is why having coding standards - and making sure everyone adheres to them - is so important on any project.

If everyone else is using 2 characters while you use 4, you either need to adapt, or you'll need to configure IntelliJ such that you can revert the formatting back to their preference (CtrlAltShiftF, maybe, to make it easy to remember?) before you commit.
    
    
Title: Can an object referencing itself inside double-brace initialization not give a NPE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have this little piece of code here, which always will throw a NPE:

public class Test1 {
    private final static Object OBJECT = new Object() {{
        System.out.println("OBJECT.toString() = " + OBJECT.toString());
    }};
    public static void main(String[] args) { }
}


Are there ways though that OBJECT can be initialized in the instance initialization block? Or will every possible reference to OBJECT in the instance initialization block always throw a NPE?

For those Fastest-Gun-In-The-Wests, read this: No, I am not asking you to solve my bug. This is a simplified piece of code I've seen somewhere and which to my surprise does not give a null warning in either Eclipse or Netbeans, which I would expect it to give.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Double brace initialisation is just an anonymous inner class with instance initialiser. 
Therefore the rules governing creating objects apply.

NPE is a Runtime Exception so an IDE uses heuristics to find the culprits rather than the rigour and certainty provided by static typing, declared exceptions, and static code analysis. Here it would have to execute the code in order to find runtime issues.

What is happening is this:
a static member is being initialised by assigning to it anonymous inner class. Constructor of the inner class has finished as this is the rule for instance initializers. However the reference is assigned only after initialisers have finished, which they have not by the time you try to dereference OBJECT.

Seems like a very circular explanation, but that's because what is happening is circular referencing ;)

You CANNOT tell IDE to "forget" any specific class ... unless you alter PhpStorm's installation and physically remove stub file for it (which you will have to do for every new version).



You could re-declare the class/functions yourself instead and add @deprecated tag to PHPDoc comments for them -- this will tell IDE to mark them as deprecated and warn you (if corresponding inspection is turned ON -- Settings | Inspections | PHP | General | Deprecated)

Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes, just use the subprocess module.

Getting output in one go

import subprocess

output = subprocess.check_output(['python', filepath])


If you want to capture the standard error out of the called process as well as standard out use this instead:

output = subprocess.check_output(['python', filepath], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)


Or if you want to capture them separately:

p = subprocess.Popen(['python', filepath],
                     stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                     stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
                     )
out, err = p.communicate()


Getting the output as it's produced

This gives you the combined stdout and strerr output, line by line:

p = subprocess.Popen(['python', filepath],
                     stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                     stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
                     )

for line in iter(p.stdout.readline, ''):
    # process the line


Keeping the UI responsive

If you run the above code on the same thread as your GUI, you are essentially blocking the Tk's event loop from running while you are waiting for each line.  This means that though you are getting each line in real-time, and writing it to your GUI, it won't update the display until the event loop gets to run again, and process all your calls to Tk.

You need to run the subprocess code on a new thread, and in your GUI thread, periodically check for new input.

...but the current tab still does not "jump out" at me; I reckon I'll have to live with identifying the bolded tab. I would really prefer an animated gif of a dancing duckbilled platypus or something, though (I'd settle for a bear, pig, or kitty-kat).

If you don't have the Productivity Power Tools for VS 2013 extension installed, I highly recommend that you download &amp; install it.

There are a number of productivity enhancements that it offers, including the ability to "Color tabs by project", or "Color tabs by regular expression". After you've installed the extension, these options are found by selecting:


Tools
Options
Power Productivity Tools
Custom Document Well


Another possibility would be the Theme Editor extension that someone in Microsoft released.

The color theme extension lets you colorize the active tab with a bright color but I can only get it to work when I switch the colorization in productivity power tools off.

For now I'm using only the color theme extension but if I can get the theme options to take priority over the productivity power tools I'll post here.

Looking at Delphi XE, it is stored in the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Embarcadero\BDS\8.0\ToolForm\Mapping(Default), so I guess that for Delphi XE4, it will be HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Embarcadero\BDS\11.0\ToolForm\Mapping(Default).

I am currently working on and on off on multiple projects. (~30)
Some of them go idle for several months.
No matter how hard I tried to be organized, I always end up with multiple subdirectories , containing git repos at different depth levels.

I would like to double-check all my work directories to make sure that I did not leave uncommitted changes or untracked folders by accident.

Is there a tool to do that ?


scan subdirectories for git repo.
list untracked files
list uncommited edits
list directories with no git repo. ( if they contain files)

There is no tool that will do exactly what you want, but you can mix together some command line utilities to get what you want.

Find All Subdirectories that have .git directory.

find . -name `.git` | xargs dirname


Run git status on each one:

for d in `find . -name .git | xargs dirname `; do pushd $d; git status; popd; done;

I want to use AMPL student version. 
also I apply its IDE for mathematical modelling, but when I open it, it pop-up a box showing the following message. 


A valid AMPL license file could not be found for this machine.
For assistance, copy this entire message and send it to licensing@ampl.com.
Details:
License file ampl.lic not found anywhere in $PATH.


What can I do to fix this issue?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The AMPL IDE distribution available for download from http://www.ampl.com/IDE/ includes a full version of ampl which requires a license. To use the student version, you need to replace the ampl and solver binaries in the amplide/ampl directory with their student versions available here.

Alternatively, you can download a demo version of the IDE from one of the following locations:


Linux: http://ampl.com/dl/demo/amplide-demo-linux32.tar.gz
OS X: http://ampl.com/dl/demo/amplide-demo-macosx.tar.gz
Windows: http://ampl.com/dl/demo/amplide-demo-mswin.zip

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Simply place the amplide folder inside the amplcml folder (which is the free student version of AMPL).


    
    
Title: Eclipse Resolve &ldquo;Organize Imports&rdquo; implicit
Description: 
    
    
                    
I can't get it. I have a common problem in Eclipse, when trying to organize Imports for the whole Project. Short example for clearification

package test.somepackage
class A{

    public B getB(){ return new B() }
}

package test.somepackage
class B{} 

package foobar
class B {}

package somewhere.in.code
class ClientUsingAAndB {

    public void someMethod(){

        A a = new A()
        //here Eclipse gets an "Organize Import Conflict"
        B b = a.getB();

    }
}


So if I try to automatically "Organize Imports" Eclipse is asking me If I want to import  test.somepackage.B or foobar.B. For me its very clear which one, and if I tell Eclipse to use foobar.B Eclipse immediatly complains about non matching return types. Thing is: If Eclipse already knows which return type it gets (from class A signature) why it acts like stupid? 
Also if I just type a.getB() hover over it, and tell Eclipse to "Assign Statement to new local variable" (strg+1), It automatically infers the correct type and adds the import.

Whats happening? Is this some kind of the annoying Eclipse bugs noone wants to fix, or do I want too much from my IDE? 

EDIT: 
If there is something not really clear, please comment it, and I'll try to provide nessesary information
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is a long-standing request (going back to 2005). See this Eclipse report that is stagnant. Perhaps you could get involved and help address it. I know the JDT team would welcome contributions for these kinds of small enhancements.

Description: 
    
    
                    
In eclipse, you can put your cursor on a method or a class to show its document. However, in Visual Studio, it only shows the summary, without the parameter info and return value type. And pressing Ctrl+Shift+Space to see the parameter info is so annoying! Is there a way that I can make VS show the complete document just like pressing F12 and seeing the definition? Thanks! :)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Maybe not exactly what you searching but you can activate the Code Definition Window via Menu -&gt; View -&gt; Code Definition Windows

If you're using Visual Studio 2013, you can use the new Peek Definition feature by hitting Alt+F12.

You can modify an existing snippet and create new ones. Here is a step-by-step guide (first result on Google, FYI) 

http://thomas.deuling.org/2011/06/add-or-edit-code-snippets-and-templates-in-aptana-studio-3/

The author does mention just searching for the .rb files though, you can see a better explanation for how to get into them in the updated version of the post he mentions. Basically you want to open a CSS file in the css editor and then use Commands &gt; Bundle Development &gt; Edit this Bundle and it will create a project for you that contains the rules for CSS files (including snippets), which you can then edit. 
    
    
Title: Run node-webkit project in Netbeans 7.4
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am trying to configure Netbeans IDE 7.4 for node-webkit development.

It is excellent IDE but I want to run my projects with F6 button. To do this I added NW.EXE as additional browser (executable is located outside project folder). 

After this I have a problem with execution arguments. NW.EXE expects a folder path to be specified as an argument, but I cannot leave empty field of Start File in project settings  and the Project URL has to start with either http:// or file:// while Node-webkit needs a path like C:/path_to_app

Does any method exist to deal with this feature?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In short, you can work this around by creating a batch program and let it strip the file name down to the path name part, to be fed to nw.exe, as it requires.

Unfortunately, as you said, we don't have full control over the way the main file of the project is passed to the browser, hence some further actions (in addition to the creation of the batch file) are needed.

This is how I got it working after a bit of struggle:


added nw.exe to the system %PATH% variable (optional, just for ease of access)
created nw.bat in the same folder as nw.exe, and filled it with this content:

@echo %1
start nw.exe %~d1%~p1



The first line of this batch file is just to inspect the actual parameter that is getting passed to the batch file.

The second line uses start to invoke nw.exe without having to wait for its return (you may need to specify the full path to nw.exe, if you didn't add it to the system %PATH% variable).

The second line also passes to nw.exe the drive part of the parameter (extracted from %1 by %~d1) concatenating it to the path of the parameter (extracted from %1 by %~p1).

For instance, my last run from within NetBeans gave this output:

D:\node\test\index.html
D:\node\test&gt;start nw.exe D:\node\test\


Then I needed something to tie the NetBeans run button to an arbitrary executable, and luckily I found a perfect fit.

So here is how I went on:


installed the Node.js Projects plugin from Timboudreau Update Center
went to Options &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Node.js and set the Node.js Binary field to point to my nw.bat file


In my project, I've also taken care to put package.json in the same folder of index.html (being that that's the main file of my package, and that's what will be fed to the batch file).

Now pressing F6 on my NetBeans installation happily runs my node-webkit project without any further ado :-)

Are there any refactoring plugins like Resharper or Visual Assist X for VS2012 for D (DMD)?

Feel free to mention any IDEs that have the functionality built-in.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
For a quick answer: no.

Sadly, there's not much tools for D yet. You should refer to this page for the list of IDE and some of their features. It's updated often. As of now, the only VS tool is VisualD.

Mono-D, plugin for MonoDevelop, and DDT, plugin for Eclipse, have very, very basic refactoring capabilities. At the moment of writing this answer there is no tool that is even remotely close to refactoring capabilities of NetBeans/IdeaJ/Eclipse when it comes to Java.
