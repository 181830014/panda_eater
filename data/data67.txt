Title: Ruby editing with intellisense
Description: 
    
    
                    
Currently I am exploring the world of ruby. Playing around in the irb you get nice intellisense for like 5.&lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;. I tried many editors/IDEs (mainly gedit, vim, radrails) with a couple of plugins. I kind of do not like the bloated eclipse-style environment but as far as I found out it is the only one providing intellisense.
All I have found for gedit/vim (never tried emacs, actually I cannot remember anyone using emacs for ruby development) are plugins doing completion based on phrases in the same file.

Is there some intellisenselike feature for an editor? In my job I am developing PHP in Eclipse PDT but I would really like to not use a bloated IDE for ruby :)

Is there an action (menu / shortcut) that I miss or plug-in to add to a basic JavaEE distribution of Eclipse 3.5 that will allow to generate / regenerate files that usualy done from command line call for rmic?

I am aware of the "RMI Plug-in for Eclipse version 2.0" I am looking for a free one.

rmic is no longer needed since java 5:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/rmi/relnotes.html

Sun's RMI was too inconvenient for development and many people came up with 'light weight rmi' replacements. Java5's simplification on RMI didn't make news because haters already moved on to other alternatives.

Title: Are there any layout comparison / vssetting sharing places?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Well, I reinstalled Visual Studio 2008 and did not have a backup of my vssetting file. I did not think it was that important as I had barely customised it, however it just doesn't feel right!

The general windows feel correct but When I switch between views (source code, Windows forms, web editor), all the toolbars get muddled up.

In the past few years, I have seen so many "post your desktop" type items and I could swear there there would be some "post your IDE", but after looking on Google and several other programming sites, I just can't find one!

I don't want this turning in to a post your IDE unless others want to, but can anyone point me to a site where they have done this, or even better - are there any vssetting sharing places where you can download ones made by others?

Title: How can I most effectively use Emacs as an editor alongside XCode?
Description: 
    
    
                    
There are a few tutorials online (For example) having to do with configuring emacs to work with XCode, but they all seem to be for old versions, and I haven't found one that ties neatly to XCode 3.x + Emacs 23.1 in a way that I can unpack.

So, I'm running XCode 3.1.2 and the Mac Cocoa application build of Emacs 23.1.  I have a passing familiarity with elisp, so modifying configurations doesn't scare me, particularly.  I'd like to be editing my Objective-C code in Emacs, because the XCode editor is painful once you've used a real text editor (snark, snark).

What should I do to make this happen?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
For Emacs.app you can adopt a cleaner approach, and it doesn't require you to change configurations (unless you don't like make-frame to be called when a file is opened from XCode, but it's very easy to change).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Well, the customization should be similar to the documentation you pointed to.  With Emacs 23, the server/client code has changed just a little.  Namely, you can start it with the [--daemon][1] option to have Emacs start a server in the background.  Then, have XCode just call Emacs using [emacsclient][2].  There are options you can use with emacsclient to force a new frame (graphical window): -c, and you can even start it off with -a to ensure you get an emacs if you forgot to start it with --daemon.

Does anyone know of a javascript based Rich Text box that behaves a bit like an IDE so that in a management system I can provide a text area for CSS and/or one for HTML to be written into the box and the input is colour coded like it is if you edit in Notepad++, Visual Studio etc Customsiation of the colours would be superb but certainly not essential!

I was sure there must be at least one but I'm struggling to find any through Google searches and instead am getting numerous results for FCKEditor style Rich Text Boxes.

Answer 2: 

    
    
I'm a bit confused about what you need. What I understood is that you are looking for a tool, where you input HTML in one textbox, CSS in another one, and the tool applies the style to the HTML to color the HTML like in Notepad++.

If this is the case, I don't know what you expect as an end result. Is it inline styling, so that you can paste the result on a page and have it displayed? To me all this sounds like it would make things more complicated than you would do it by hand - maintainability, etc. I don't think you'll find such a tool anywhere, it doesn't seem logical to me.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a VS solution that contains 6 library projects and 1 web folder project.

When I try to use the "Find All References" feature on an object or method, it takes more than 6 minutes to finish !

It seems to be refactoring every aspx &amp; ascx file of the web project.

Any idea on how to make it faster ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You didn't mention which version of Visual Studio you are running, but I found a blurb that claims they did some performance improvements between 2005 and 2005SP1


  We made a change in the VS2005 SP1
  (and included it in VS 2008) which
  optimizes performance in web projects
  by first performing a lexical search
  of the element being refactored to
  determine if the page needs to be
  loaded. I apologize for it taking us
  so long to update this issue with the
  resolution; there were several connect
  bugs that were related and while we
  updated most we managed to miss some. 
  
  We expect that in the future we'll do
  even more performance enhancements for
  this scenario (post VS 2008), but
  hopefully the optimizations we have
  done drastically increase performance
  in most cases.


Also, this solution kinda sucks, but MS offered this workaround too:


  With respect to workarounds you can
  increase the performance fairly
  significantly if you open all of the
  web pages prior to performing the
  refactoring. I agree that it isn't a
  particularly good workaround, but for
  VS 2005 we chose to prioritze
  correctness over performance for
  refactoring.

This is my complete answer, according to our exchanges.

Issue #1


  No module named clr


After some checks, it seems there was a kind of mix between the operating system environment, and your project's virtual environment.

Solution: delete and re-create properly virtual environment fixed it



Issue #2


  Unresolved reference 'System'


In this case where corresponding modules are loaded dynamically, your best solution is to disable PyCharm's Inspector on these specific lines; thus you won't loose anything else in your IDE.

You can see How to disable inspection.

In my sandbox, I just had to:


go on corresponding source code lines with warning (one after the other)
use the More actions context menu on the error (System in this case)
use the Ignore unresolved reference 'pythonnet_tests.System' sub-menu
use finally the Suppress for statement


Each time the corresponding source code line, will be preceded by a comment line:

# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences

Title: How do you get the python colour scheme while using sage on VS code?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Currently, I name my files as .py while working on them, and then change them to .sage when I need to execute. Is there a way to get the python colour scheme for sage files on VS code?

There is an extension called SAGE enterprise management that claims to do it, but the instructions are a bit unclear:

It says:

Create a x3-code named folder inside your ~/.vscode/extensions/;
Copy all files in yours recent created folder;
Reload VS Code and enjoy;

I tried both copying my sage files into the folder, and the contents of the x3-extension into the folder, both of which didn't work. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The instructions referred to in the question are for Sage the
accounting software, not for SageMath the Sage mathematics
software system.

In the case of SageMath, we need to tell VS Code to apply Python
formatting not only to files ending in .py, but also to files
ending in .sage. One way to do that is to use the "file to
language association" setting:


https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/vMarch#_file-to-language-association


One would add associations from "*.sage" to "python".

Studio Code's language extension files are located on macOS
and Windows:

Title: No type hovers in Visual Studio Code for Haskell
Description: 
    
    
                    
I can't get my VS Code to show Haskell type hovers. Also, there's no autocompletion. All I see is just a small, empty box just above the element I hover with my mouse (see the small box right about "getArgs" function).


The extension I use is "Haskelly", though I've tried extensions for Atom editor as well and the result was similar.

Has anyone had a similar issue before ?
I use:


VS Code: 1.27.1
ghc: 8.0.2
ghc-mod: 5.8.0.0
haskelly: 0.5.4
Intero: 0.1.32
OS: Linux Mint 19


Disclaimer: I'm quite new to Haskell, so it might be the case that I'm doing something terribly wrong here. Sorry, still learning ;).

EDIT:

As suggested in a comment I've switched to Haskero and managed to make a small progress. There is a type hover, but it contains some garbage.



One thing that might matter: I'm following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7R-2vtPLDM, so I use cabal, not stack. Does it matter at all ?

EDIT 2:

I've tried using stack, but the result was even worse. The VS Code extension crashed with the following code:

The following GHC options are incompatible with GHCi and have not been passed to it: -threaded
Configuring GHCi with the following packages: MyProject

EDIT 3:

Still no good, but a bit closer. For built-in values and within the same package I can see pretty type hovers. However, I see errors for values from my modules when referenced in the other modules (even though they live next to each other and everything compiles just fine):



Any ideas how to help with this ?

As the quickest solution, I decided to install Haskell IDE Engine (HIE: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine) and use it with Atom. Didn't manage to configure it with VS code, though, but that's ok for now.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I know it's been a long time, but I'd like to share my past experience. Maybe someone takes the advantage of it and won't need to go through the same list of problems.

After spending hours reading articles and talking to various people I came up with the conclusion that the best way to get started with Haskell is... just to get started with Haskell. I installed ghc platform and cabal, use the cabal new-style commands and that seems to be enough. At least for now. Also, I decided to use VSCode with just a simple syntax-highlighting extension.

I found out that any attempt to introduce more IDE-like features are unlikely to succeed, as Haskell is a very complex language. "hie" is a nice little idea, but it's missing stability and reliability to me - over the time I learnt how to install it, but for me it works only for simple cases and crashes with more real-life applications.

Recently I've been trying to create a very simple DB + Web API App now and I've been having hard times in making the two monads talk to each other properly. I think there's no IDE that could do this for me anyway. When I find it difficult to write down the correct type of a function, then I use "cabal new-repl", load my module, check the desired type with ":t" and make an attempt to decypher the output. Not a perfect solution, but again - good enough.

Title: How to disable removing unused imports?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I use goimports to automatically reformat my code and make it clean and also keep import in order. But sometimes it works in an incomfortable way together with IDE autosave. Like in this scenario:


I want to add new package to my code.
Then I install it with dep ensure and refresh my IDE cache.
I can comfortably use the package with IDE autocomplete and navigation.


What happens with goimports and IDE?


I add new package
In order to run dep ensure I have to save a file
goimports finds unused package and removes it from imports. Not good.


Workaround:

A. Add new package manually with dep ensure -add %packagename%

B. Disable goimports and move to gofmt - so-so.

C. Do not autoformat code on save - undesirable.

How to setup things more convenient?

P.S. Unsure about tag godeps but DEP is definitly wrong here.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The correct solution would be to invoke dep ensure -add package/name yourself and then just start using the package without manually importing it, the IDE will figure out that you want to use that package and will add the import automatically. The current behavior you are experiencing is exactly what's expected from the IDE since goimports is invoked on save and because the import is not used it will be automatically removed.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I understand that I can open a project in WebStorm from terminal using its shell tools.

At the moment, WebStorm open the current working directory with the command webstorm .

However, if I navigate to a different project (say project2) in my terminal and run the same command webstorm . again. I expect WebStorm to open my project2 in a new window, but for some reason this doesn't happen.

Please let me know if there is a setting which should be enabled to use this feature.

All other editors (VS Code, Atom, Sublime) support this, I'm hoping that WebStorm would also have a similar feature. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It's a little clunky because it only works on a Mac, but I came up with a work around for this issue.
1. Paste this into your .bash_profile:

# Open WebStorm project
ws(){
  for var in "$@"
    do
    open -a /Applications/WebStorm.app "$var"
  done
}


2. To use, open your terminal (make sure it's a new terminal session so it reflects the .bash_profile changes) and run:

$ ws /some/project/directory


or to open multiple projets at the same time:

$ ws /some/project/directory /some/other/project/directory


This will focus the window of the project being opened. Also, if the project is already opened, it will only focus the project's window rather than opening a new session.
    
    
Title: IntelliJ/WebStorm &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; Indenting / Tab on newline
Description: 
    
    
                    
So this seems like quite a trivial question.
At the moment when declaring an object, and assigning values as such:

let object = {
    myValue: "some value" &lt;--- Now typically here I would hit &lt;comma&gt; &lt;enter&gt;
}


What use to happen:

let object = {
    myValue: "some value",
    anotherValue: "some other value"
}


What is happening now:

let object = {
    myValue: "some value",
        anotherValue: "some other value" &lt;--- What is with this additional tabspace?
}


It's driving me nuts, and it's such a weird and specific thing to explain, google to no avail!

Every time I declare object properties I have to &lt;shift&gt; &lt;tab&gt; this additional space or &lt;backspace&gt;. Seriously driving me nuts, completely destroys my grove. This has been included in the new WebStorm update (2017.2).

Where is the setting to change this? What do I call this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I got it sorted.
So it's very specific to the following conditions:


You're editing a file that has x spaces on indents / tabs
Your default indent / tab spacing is y


Webstorm, assumes you want to apply: y indent / tab spaces when hitting your tab key, or creating a newline on a tabbed / indented element. So it applies y indent spaces. But it also recognises that the file has x spaces per indent.

The result is, when you hit tab on a indented element, it will indent by x spaces and when you create a newline on a indented element, it indent by y spaces.

Title: How can I install Armadillo on Windows?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I need to install and use Armadillo library to deal with linear algebra. 

I went to their websites and downloaded .tar.xz file, but I have no idea how to install it.

How can I install Armadillo? (I'm primarily using Dev-C++, but I also sometimes use XCode)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you are using Windows, you might be using Visual Studio for compilation. Extract tarball using 7zip or other extraction software and save it in the directory of your choice. For example your path could be, C:\armadillo.
In the Visual Studio solution, do the following:

Add armadillo directory under Property Manager --&gt; C/C++ --&gt; General --&gt; Additional Include Directories, add semicolon after existing entries, followed by C:\armadillo\include;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)

If you are using 64-bit version to build also do the following:

Property Manager --&gt; Linker --&gt; General --&gt; Additional Library Directories, add semicolon after existing entries, followed by C:\armadillo\examples\lib_win64;%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)
Property Manager --&gt; Linker --&gt; Input --&gt; Additional Dependencies, add semicolon after existing entries, followed by blas_win64_MT.lib;lapack_win64_MT.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)

Ensure that you are modifying the Property Manager in the same Solution Configuration and Solution Platform that you are using for the build. If this was successful, you should be able to use armadillo by simply adding #include &lt;armadillo&gt; in your header file.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
.tar.xz is archive. Try using 7zip for extracting.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Armadillo is a c++ library and does not need "installing". Just extract the archive and point your compiler/linker to the appropriate subfolders. For gcc the options are -L for the library path and -I for the include path. For finally running your program you would do something like LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[path to library folder of armadillo] ./[your program] under linux, not sure what the corresponding command would be under windows.

Sublime text is my favourite text editor. That's why I want to make this as full C or C++ IDE. I have already downloaded MinGW compiler. Using that I can compile and run my program. But I am facing problems in taking input from sublime text console.

Is it possible to use scanf or cin function in Sublime text ??

If possible, please suggest me the exact way.

Answer 1: 

    
    
As mentioned before REPL is a good solution. Another simple workaround is running the program in a new console window. Here's how my build system for running C++ programs on Windows looks like:

{
  "shell_cmd": "g++ -Wall \"${file}\" -o \"${file_path}/${file_base_name}\"",
  "file_regex": "^(..[^:]*):([0-9]+):?([0-9]+)?:? (.*)$",
  "working_dir": "${file_path}",
  "selector": "source.cpp, source.c++",

  "variants":
  [
    { 
      "name": "New window",
      "shell_cmd": "start cmd.exe @cmd /k \"@g++ -Wall \"${file}\" -o \"${file_path}/${file_base_name}\" &amp;&amp; \"${file_path}/${file_base_name}\" &amp; @pause &amp; exit\""
    }

}


You can save it into your sublime user packages catalog with extension .sublime-build.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using Geany IDE and I'm trying to get rid of all the #ifdef's and #ifndef's in my code. There are more than 1000 occurrences, they are nested and it is impossible to do it manually.

Here is an example:

#define EXPLAIN

#ifndef EXPLAIN
...
#endif
...
#ifdef EXPLAIN
...
#else
...
#endif


Somewhere the condition is #ifdef and somewhere it is #ifndef. You got the idea... Is there an easy way to get rid of them with all the corresponding code?

I will download and install any other software if needed.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
A good solution is to run gcc using the -E flag which only runs the preprocessor. The following command:

gcc -E -D EXPLAIN file.cpp -o file.i


Preprocesses file.cpp and outputs file.i which is file.cpp preprocessed with the EXPLAIN macro defined.

Some useful flags if you want to produce an output file that is generally more readable and closer to what an input file would be expected to look like:


-D NAME to define the macro NAME with definition 1.
-fdirectives-only to process directives but not macros.
-C to keep comments.
-P to inhibit line markers.


Even with these flags, #includes will be replaced with the files you are including preprocessed. You can fix this by simply getting rid of the #includes, preprocessing the input file, and then adding the #includes in the output file.

Source: Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC): Preprocessor Options.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can use unifdef to achieve this.


  The unifdef utility selectively processes conditional C preprocessor
  #if and #ifdef directives. It removes from a file both the directives and the additional text that they delimit, while otherwise leaving the
  file alone.

    
    
Title: Running a pip-installed Spyder in virtual environment on Ubuntu without Anaconda?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I just recently started learning Ubuntu (17.04) and have managed to figure out how get plain Python3.5 + Spyder3 running, have created a virtual environment, and gotten the v-env running with Spyder by changing the interpreter setting within Spyder via pointing it to the virtual environment bin. 

However, I saw numerous other ways of installing Spyder, primarily via a pip3 install in the environment itself, but I found nothing as to how to actually RUN the pip-installed Spyder. Running "Spyder3" always runs the default install regardless of location.

Does anyone know how to actually run it?

I was curious because I figured it would allow for a similar functionality that Anaconda provides where you can simply select your virtual environment and run the respective Spyder version for it.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I have JSLint and Atom-beautify (which I believe is a front-end for jsbeautify) installed in Atom. Generally that's pretty dandy, except that they bicker about ternary operators (I think that's the right term). So if I do

  var theWindow = (thisObj instanceof Panel)? thisObj: new Window(&quot;palette&quot;, thisObj.scriptTitle, undefined, {resizeable: true});

JSBeautify will make it look like:
var theWindow = (thisObj instanceof Panel)
  ? thisObj
  : new Window(&quot;palette&quot;, thisObj.scriptTitle, undefined, {resizeable: true});

And then JSLint will complain about bad line breaking.

I had a look at the JSBeautify documentation and the JSLint documentation, but I can't find any option for changing either's behaviour regarding ternary syntax. Can anyone tell me how I can change it so I don't have to manually reformat all my ternary functions every time I beautify my code? I don't mind which one prevails as long as they agree.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Simply add option "preserve_ternary_lines":true in .jsbeautifyrc

You're asking about jslint (“lint”), but the linter in use is actually jshint (“hint”.)
jshint
Create a .jshintrc file and add the following rule to tolerate multi-line strings
{
  &quot;multistr&quot;: true
}

You also might have to set &quot;laxbreak&quot; to true, this tolerates possibly unsafe line breakings. See the example for all available options
jslint
Again, you can create a .jslintrc file to override the default options of JSLint. Use the example as reference.

You have your console view set to the wrong console.

There is a build console and the normal output console. It should switch to the output console when running, automatically (but, any ways, it didn't).

On the console view there is a set of buttons, one of which looks like a little monitor. If you click on the little arrow next to that you can select the output console for your program:

Spyder will run pylint.exe, not pylint.bat, that's why what you tried doesn't work.

Title: PhpStorm refactor local variable to class field
Description: 
    
    
                    
Like in topic, i want to refactor local variable to class field.

I was thinking of two approaches:

A. Quick and simple:
I want to refactor name of variable from $var to $this-&gt;var.

B. Extended version:

from: 

class x {
    function y() {
        $var = new targetClass;
    }
}


to:

class x {
    /** @var targetClass $var */ // version C, optional
    (public|protected|private) $var;
    function y() {
        $this-&gt;var = new targetClass;
    }
}


Can't do any of this, when I try to refactor $var, simply by refactoring it to $this-&gt;var, I end up with a message: 


  Inserted identifier is invalid


Defining $this-&gt;var first doesn't help either.

Only workaround I found is to type $this-&gt;var, loose focus on refactoring variable, type whatever and delete it. Then PhpStorm is cheated and variable is changed. It simple dirty-covers approach A.

Title: Delphi OpenTools API - Editing the project requires clause
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have written an OpenTools wizard for creating a skeleton for a custom project type.  It does work, and the project and units are properly created.  But, how do I edit the .dpk or .dpk file's requires clause?

A call to ModuleServices.CreateModule(MyIOTAProjectCreatorInterface) gives me the .dproj file only.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In my VCL Component Installer (since XE, this is part of the Delphi IDE), I do it this way:

procedure TCompInstallWizard.AddReferenceFiles(InstallProject: IOTAProject;
  const FileNames: array of string);
var
  ReferenceFile: string;
begin
  WriteDebugMessage('AddReferenceFiles');
  for ReferenceFile in FileNames do
    if not ContainsFile(InstallProject, ReferenceFile) then
      InstallProject.AddFile(ReferenceFile, False);
end;


with the help of function IOTAProject.AddFile(FileName, IsUnitOrForm). Note that I call it like this:

if FPersonality = ppCppBuilder then
  AddReferenceFiles(InstallProject,
    ['rtl.bpi', 'designide.bpi', 'vcl.bpi', 'vclactnband.bpi',
     'vclx.bpi', 'xmlrtl.bpi'])
else
  AddReferenceFiles(InstallProject,
    ['rtl.dcp', 'designide.dcp', 'vcl.dcp', 'vclactnband.dcp',
     'vclx.dcp', 'xmlrtl.dcp']);


Note that the docs say:

{ Call this function to add an arbitrary file to the project.  NOTE: some
  files have special meaning to different projects.  For example: adding
  VCL60.DCP will cause a new entry in a package project's "requires" list
  while it will be a raw file to any other project type.  Set IsUnitOrForm
  to true for files that are considered items that the project would
  process directly or indirectly (ie. .pas, .cpp, .rc, etc..) or can be
  opened in the code editor. For all others, including binary files
  (.res, .bpi, .dcp, etc..) set this to False. }
procedure AddFile(const AFileName: string; IsUnitOrForm: Boolean);


This means that if you add a 'bla.dcp' it will automatically land in the requires section, and if you add a 'bla.pas' file, it will land in the contains section. It took me a while to find out.

I'm on a computer that allows the installation of IDEs but not compilers. I want to be able to work on this computer do to ease of access. Is there anything I can do?

Answer 1: 

    
    

  allows the installation of IDEs but not compilers


Neither IDE nor compiler need to be "installed".

As an example, Eclipse can be downloaded as a .zip file and simply unpacked. No installation required.

Java, at least the Sun/Oracle version, only comes as an installer, but it doesn't actually need to be "installed". If you can install on another machine, then just zip/copy the files. You just need to add the bin folder to your PATH.

For Eclipse, you don't even need Java on the PATH, just add the -vm option to the eclipse.ini file.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The short answer is no.
Java code (.java) is compiled into byte code (.class).
This byte code is then interpreted by the JRE.
The step where the byte code is compiled cannot be skipped because that would violate the nature of the language.
Solutions like online compilers may be your only option.
Best of luck!
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I am afraid you won't be able to run python code on such a computer as well. Compiler program(javac.exe) and Interpreter program(python.exe) are both executable files from OS perspective. If you can't install one, same policy/restriction should prevent you to install the other.

One option in this case is to do a ssh (using putty on windows) session to a computer that has java installed. You won't require internet connection in case this other computer/server is in your local LAN/home network.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
for running and developing Java applications you need a JVM installed: there is no escape.
If you are in a restricted environment you can install a "portable JDK" and then "install" eclipse IDE that is as easy as unzip the archive.

I recently switched to QTCreator for C++ from Eclipse background. 

I am looking for these two features in QtCreator... 

(1) I want to open the file a class is written in by typing that class's name. For example Ctrl+Shft+T in Eclipse. 

(2) I want to move back to where my cursor were before the current operation.

To open the file of a class:


If you are in a file that is making use of the class, you can place the cursor on the class then press F2. By default, F2 is bound to the Follow Symbol Under Cursor action.
If you want to get to the class without to find an instance of it, you can use the Locator . By default Press:


ctrl + k to access the locator

To navigate back to where you were, you can use GoBack and GoForward, as mentioned by Roman Zaytsev. These default to alt + left and alt + right.

Title: How do I disable Spring Dashboard on startup on GGTS?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I recently installed GGTS. It's been good so far but it's starting to annoy me how the dashboard (window) keeps showing up on start up. I checked the preferences but there's nothing there that switches it off. I attempted to uninstall the feature, but the GGTS won't allow me.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You are probably running into this bug: STS-3935. The dashboard is supposed to stay closed when you close it, but in some situations in STS 3.6.2 it doesn't.

If you upgrade to a newer version of STS the problem should go away. If you do not want to upgrade your STS, you can also try running with JDK 8 (so you'll get the new dashboard which is not subject to the bug). 

Or, another workaround suggested in the bug-report is to open manually edit the preferences file at workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.springsource.ide.eclipse.dashboard.ui.prefs and add or change the line:

org.springsource.ide.eclipse.dashboard.uidashboard.startup=false

You can configure your TODO patterns here:

Settings &gt; Editor &gt; TODO


If you want to keep using todo for marking tasks, you can change the todo pattern into TODO and mark it as case sensitive (so only upper-case TODO will lead to marking a task).

If you don't want to use it, just delete or change it into something else.

"""


and python-mode highlights those words 'TODO'.

The already mentioned TaskList plugin searches only the current file, and uses a scratch buffer for display. My own GrepTasks plugin basically implements the solution in @hhbcarl's answer, using :vimgrep and the quickfix list.

In the old days, MS/DOS used a special driver ANSI.SYS to emulate ANSI command codes. It looks like this good old driver is usable under Windows XP (but you need do configure it in config.sys), but I found some articles saying it no longer works on Windows 7 and above.

So ANSI (or vt100 or vt220) codes are useful in Linux or Unix terminals, but under Windows, my advice would be to directly use the Windows API Console functions declared in Wincon.h - but you should alway include Windows.h when using Windows API functions.

You will need to use the Windows SDK as a reference, but here is a small program writing foo_bar in position 15,5 :

#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;tchar.h&gt; // compatibility 8/16 bits characters

int _tmain(int argc, const LPSTR *argv) {
    HANDLE hStdOut = ::GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE); // console output handle
    COORD dwCursorPosition;
    DWORD nb;
    dwCursorPosition.X = 15;
    dwCursorPosition.Y = 5;
    ::WriteConsoleOutputCharacter(hStdOut, _T("foo_bar"), 7, dwCursorPosition, &amp;nb);

    return 0;
}

But ... you can list files from another project there (in Project View panel). If that is good enough, then just go to Settings | Directories and add desired folder as an Additional Content Root.

Traceback (most recent call last):

I am not sure what this means.

idlex runs as expected with no obvious errors that I can determine. 

Does idlex need to be installed in a particular location in relation to Python to eliminate this error? (i.e. in the python folder in Lib?)

Thank you.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It looks like you're missing IPython. 

You may do either a pip install ipython or easy_install ipython, refer to here if you need help with that.

The error is a NameError saying that it does not have a definition for the variable channels which is called by the import that relies on IPython in "idlex-1.12/idlex1.12/idlexlib/extension/IPyIDLE.py":

if HAS_IPYTHON:
# IPython
...
import IPython.kernel.channels as channels
...


Where the error occurs is further down the file:

class IdleXSubSocketChannel(SimpleChannel, channels.IOPubChannel):
     channel_name = 'sub'


Once you've got IPython install that error is resolved, however you'll run into another error following that (if you have a base install):

ImportError: IPython.kernel.zmq requires pyzmq &gt;= 2.1.11


Which can be resolved by either pip install pyzmq or easy_install pyzmq, and once you've done that IdleX should run without throwing errors at you.

Title: PostgreSQL step debugging in IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'd like to know if anybody had success with debugging postgres through an IDE (NetBeans or Eclipse) by attaching the debugger to the process and still perform step debugging (stop at breakpoints and watch variables).
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
For most cases, debugging PostgreSQL isn't significantly different to any other server in this regard.

You determine the process ID of the process you wish to examine, then attach the debugger to it and set breakpoints/watchpoints and continue execution. When you hit the break/watch, examine, step, etc as required.

You can SELECT pg_backend_pid() to get the process ID of the current session.

I usually start psql, SELECT pg_backend_pid(), attach gdb, set my breaks/watches, cont, and in my psql session run whatever I expect to trigger my breakpoint/watchpoint. The same principle applies with IDE debuggers (Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, whatever).

See: the PostgreSQL wiki for some instructions.
