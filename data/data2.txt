For CTRL+F11 to work the way you want, you must set (from "Windows/Preferences") the
"Run/debug &gt; Launching : Launch Operation" setting to:


  Always launch the previously launched application




As  Thorbjørn Ravn Andersen mentions in the comment, launching the last app used to be (3.2 or before) the default behavior.
Since 3.3M6 (March 2007), As illustrated by this thread:


  By default, running and debugging applications has been simplified to run or debug the selected file or active editor.
  When the selected resource (or active editor) is not executable, users can opt to launch the associated project or re-launch the previous launch. 
  
  These settings are managed on the Run/Debug &gt; Launching preference page.
  Users can also revert to the 3.2 behavior of always launching the previous application.




Torsten confirms in the comments:


  Pressing F11 only launches the last application in debug mode.

Ctl + F11 did not work for me either (Neon on Lubuntu). I started doing this:
Alt + r + t + 1

One could also use h instead of t to debug: Alt + r + h + #

I know it's a little longer but as long as I do not have to reach for the mouse and I can do it reliably on any Linux machine I am fine. Also, this way I can execute up to 9 previous runs by changing the number

Title: How do I autoindent in Netbeans?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In eclipse you can click Ctrl+I at any line, and it'll automatically indent the line or group of lines according to the indentation scheme you chose in the settings.

I'm really missing this feature in Netbeans. Is there any equivalent feature?

I'm aware of Alt+Shift+F but it's not good enough. I want to indent a group of lines, and not all the file.

Answer 2: 

    
    
Shortcut:

Windows: Alt+Shift+F
Mac OS X: Ctrl+Shift+F (note: it's Ctrl and not ⌘)

On using above shortcut, NetBeans indents your selection. If nothing's selected, it indents the whole file.
You can even format multiple files/folders at a time! In the Projects window/sidebar, if you select one or more folders or files and use the shortcut, NetBeans asks &quot;Recursively format selected files and folders?&quot;. Pressing OK will recursively format all the selected files/folders.
Above shortcuts works on NetBeans from versions 7 to 12.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Shift + Alt + F indents the whole file.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Select the lines you want to reformat (indenting), then hit Alt+Shift+F. Only the selected lines will be reformatted.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Ctrl+Shift+F will do a format of all the code in the page.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Here's the complete procedure to auto-indent a file with Netbeans 8.

First step is to go to Tools -&gt; Options and click on Editor button and Formatting tab as it is shown on the following image.



When you have set your formatting options, click the Apply button and OK. Note that my example is with C++ language, but this also apply for Java as well.

The second step is to CTRL + A on the file where you want to apply your new formatting setting. Then, ALT + SHIFT + F or click on the menu Source -&gt; Format.

Hope this will help.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
If you want auto-indent just like Emacs does it on TAB, i.e. indent the current line and move the cursor to the first non-whitespace character, do this:


Go to Tools -
Answer 8: 

    
    
I have netbeans 6.9.1 open right now and ALT+SHIFT+F indents only the lines you have selected.

If no lines are selected then it will indent the whole document you are in.

1 possibly unintended behavior is that if you have selected ONLY 1 line, it must be selected completely, otherwise it does nothing. But you don't have to completely select the last line of a group nor the first. 

I expected it to indent only one line by just selecting the first couple of chars but didn't work, yea i know i am lazy as hell...
    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
To format all the code in NetBeans, press Alt + Shift + F. If you want to indent lines, select the lines and press Alt + Shift + right arrow key, and to unindent, press Alt + Shift + left arrow key.

for Java NetBeans 7.1 and later, even in NetBeans 8.0 (That i´m currently using) and later, the shortcut is:

I'm not sure if this function is restricted only to phpStorm 9, but there's a simpler solution: if the extension of a file is .php, you can right click on the file in project browsing menu and click "mark as php". That fixed the problem for me.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
The easiest way to fix this is to go to File &gt; Settings on Windows (or PHPStorm &gt; Preferences on MacOS), then search for "FILE TYPES". 

Scroll down to the troublesome filetype (in this case PHP). 

Then look for the expected file extension (in this case .php).



If you see it's missing (as above), then just add it by pressing the + button under "Registered Patterns". Then in the "Add Wildcard" window that opens you would type: *.php



PHPStorm will then tell you that it's mapped to another filetype (the one that's caused this problem), and would you like to move it to this one instead. Simply click "Yes" and it will fix everything. You're all done!

This is much easier than hunting around the other file types for broken one to delete.

Currently using Visual Studio Code and the command to disable tslint is 

/* tslint:disable */

worked for me. Check out this page, about 3/4 of the way down there are some disable commands https://c9.io/lijunle/tslint

Something to note. The disable above disables ALL tslint rules on that page. If you want to disable a specific rule half way down the page there is a list of rules. So you can turn off specific things such as

/* tslint:disable comment-format */

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
In addition to Michael's answer, consider a second way: adding linterOptions.exclude to tslint.json

For example, you may have tslint.json with following lines:

{
  "linterOptions": {
    "exclude": [
      "someDirectory/*.d.ts"
    ]
  }
}

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Starting from tslint v5.8.0 you can set an exclude property under your linterOptions key in your tslint.json file:

{
  "extends": "tslint:latest",
  "linterOptions": {
      "exclude": [
          "bin",
          "**/__test__",
          "lib/*generated.js"
      ]
  }
}

Answer 5: 

    
    
There are others who encountered the problem. Unfortunately, there is only an open issue for excluding files: https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/73

So I'm afraid the answer is no. 
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I had to use the **/* syntax to exclude the files in a folder:

    "linterOptions": {
        "exclude": [
          "src/auto-generated/**/*",
          "src/app/auto-generated/**/*"
        ]
    },

    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
linterOptions is currently only handled by the CLI.
If you're not using CLI then depending on the code base you're using you'll need to set the ignore somewhere else. webpack, tsconfig, etc
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
Can confirm that on version tslint 5.11.0 it works by modifying lint script in package.json by defining exclude argument:

"lint": "ng lint --exclude src/models/** --exclude package.json"

I have found this guide from VP https://knowhow.visual-paradigm.com/technical-support/running-vp-in-android-studio/ created on September 8, 2015. 

Good to know - it is possible to integrate VP into Android studio (in my case 1.5.1) now. Do not forget to backup your Android Studio settings (you can find them in Users%userName/.AndroidStudioX.X on Windows) ahead of installation.

I was trying to make it work, but created vp project did not contain any diagrams. Maybe someone else will have more luck.

  Thank you for your inquiry and I'm very sorry that at the moment we
  only support integrate with the standard IntelliJ IDEA, but
  not integrate with the Android Studio. We may consider to support it in our future release, and I'll keep you post once there
  any update on this topics. Feel free to contact me for any questions

You can use the simple program StarUML. The trial version is unlimited and can do almost anything. 

Onced installed you can use it to generate great number of uml digrams just by pasting the source code. Class diagram is just one type of it. (It understands not only Java language but C#, C++ and other) 

P.S. The program is great for drawing architectural diagrams  before you start to code the program. 
    
    
Title: Emacs Ruby autocomplete almost working
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been updating my emacs config with the use of Rsense to allow for an autocomplete drop down box to appear whilst typing code.  This works well in most files except I've found it doesn't allow me to select an answer from the table when I'm editing some code in my ruby on rails project.

Here is my setup:
https://github.com/map7/simple_emacs

I'm using this under Ubuntu 10.04.

For simple ruby script files it works great. I can open up a new file and type.

"test".up...


Just as I type the 'p' character in up a list of options appear and I can go up and down the list with arrow keys and select one (eg: upcase) with the enter key.

What doesn't work is when I do the exact same test but within a rails project's base directory.

Update:

Found that the problem is with (require 'rails), so it's something in the emacs-rails plugin that the autocomplete doesn't like.

Update: 

It's within emacs-rails -/ppre class="lang-rb prettyprint-override"code/code/prep/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
Here's a thought: The macro binds a flet function (rails-project:root) one time to the value that (rails-project:root) has just before the body executes. (That's how it claims a performance increase: Apparently the outer (rails-project:root) is expensive, so calling once and caching the value seems like a good idea.)

Unfortunately, if there is code inside the body that has a side effect meant intentionally to change the value that (rails-project:root) returns, it's going to have no effect.  That change will be invisible even to other code called within the body because Emacs lisp has dynamic binding of flet names.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Is it possible to set the PHP version value, say 4.0+ and have PHPStorm highlight functions that wouldn't work with the oldest version? For example, for PHP4 this should highlight static function etc. I have a PHP installation on my PC but I don't want to install an older PHP version for every small script I have to produce. 

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
So, you mean to highlight all pieces of code that will not work with the PHP version you are writing it in, right? That can be done here:
Preferences -&gt; Languages &amp; Frameworks &gt; PHP
and the same on Mac:
PhpStorm -&gt; Preferences (⌘,) -&gt; Languages &amp; Frameworks &gt; PHP
Or with newer versions of PhpStorm in Windows:
File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Languages &amp; Frameworks &gt; PHP

then select your PHP version, for example, 7.0
This is very useful when your local system runs PHP 7.0, for example, but production is running PHP 5.5.
That way PhpStorm will warn you which parts will not work in production, show proper hints during writing code according to the selected version, etc.

In case your field is disabled.

Probably your settings "Synchronize IDE settings with composer.json" is enabled

You may change your PHP version in composer.json file

"require": {
    "php": "&gt;=7.1.0",
}


OR disable your settings in this path

File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Languages &amp; Frameworks &gt; PHP &gt; Composer


*If you change your composer.json file - 
As Félix Gagnon-Grenier commented,
   Keep in mind  it has effects on the way packages will be required later
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Open the Settings dialog box by choosing File | Settings, then click PHP under Languages &amp; Frameworks. The PHP page opens.



Now you can do 2 things:


On the PHP page that opens you can set the "PHP Language Level".
You can install the PHP version that you wish locally by, for example, installing packages like wamp or xamp and then set the interpreter of your PHP on the PHP page that you opened. More info here

I created a project in NetBeans, and I would like to clear the NetBeans cache.

I'm running NetBeans 7.0.1 on a Windows 7 machine.

How do I do this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Before 7.2, the cache is at C:\Users\username\.netbeans\7.0\var\cache. Deleting this directory should clear the cache for you.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Close NetBeans before deleting the cache.

NetBeans 7.2+, Windows 7

Cache is located in C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\NetBeans\Cache\.

Clear the cache using the %USERPROFILE% Windows variable:

del /s /q %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\NetBeans\Cache\


If it is set, you can also use the environment variable %LOCALAPPDATA%:

del /s /q %LOCALAPPDATA%\NetBeans\Cache\


NetBeans 7.2+, Linux

Cache is at: ~/.cache/netbeans/${netbeans_version}/index/

Mac OS X

Cache is at: ~/Library/Caches/NetBeans/${netbeans_version}/

Help Menu

On Windows, selecting the Help » About menu will display a dialog that contains the following text:

Product Version: NetBeans IDE 8.0.2 (Build 201411181905)
Java: 1.7.0_80; Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 24.80-b11
Runtime: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 1.7.0_80-b15
System: Windows 7 version 6.1 running on amd64; Cp1252; en_CA (nb)
User directory: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\NetBeans\8.0.2
Cache directory: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\NetBeans\Cache\8.0.2


Regardless of operating system, the About dialog will contain the correct path to the cache directory.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The path of the cache directory is listed in the About window (menu Help/About).  Close NetBeans, then delete (or rename) the directory. NetBeans will rebuild its cache when it starts up.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
On a Mac with NetBeans 8.1,


NetBeans → About
Find  User Directory path in the About screen
rm -fr 8.1 In your case the version could be different; remove the right version folder.
Reopen NetBeans

    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I'll just add that I have tried to resolve reference problems caused by a missing library in the cache, and deleting the cache was not enough to solve the problem.

I closed NetBeans (7.2.1), deleted the cache, then reopened NetBeans, and it regenerated the cache, but the library was still missing (checked by looking in .../Cache/7.2.1/index/archives.properties).

To resolve the problem I had to close my open projects before closing NetBeans and deleting the cache.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
For Netbeans 7.4 and above in Linux, the cache is $HOME/.cache/netbeans/7.4.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
In Window 7 the cache is located at C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/NetBeans/Cache
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
The NetBeans cachedir is a directory consisting of files that may become large, may change frequently, and can be deleted and recreated at any time. For example, the results of the Java classpath scan reside in the cachedir.

NetBeans 7.1 and older
By default the userdir is inside a (hidden) directory called .netbeans stored in the user's home directory. The home directory is ${HOME} on Unix-like systems, and %USERPROFILE% (usually set to C:\Documents and Settings\) on Windows. The cachedir can be found in var/cache subfolder of the userdir.
As the name suggests, the userdir is unique per user. For each version of NetBeans installed, the userdir will be a unique subdirectory such as .netbeans/.
To find out your exact userdir location, go to the IDE's main menu, and choose Help

Just install cache eraser plugin, it is compatible with nb6.9, 7.0,7.1,7.2 and 7.3:
To configure the plugin you have to provide the cache dir which is in netbean's about screen.

Answer 11: 

    
    
tl;dr
You might not need to whack your entire NetBeans cache.



My problem manifested as running a clean build didn't delete the previous build folder or testuserdir folder, while I was using NetBeans 8.0.2.

The first time I had this problem, Ray Slater's answer above helped me immensely. I had two Project Groups, and had to close each project in both groups, close NetBeans, clear the cache, then add my projects back to my groups before it would work again. 

Later, this problem cropped up again with NetBeans 8.1. I closed NetBeans, and ran ant build clean at the command line, and it worked. When I reopened NetBeans, the problem was resolved. It occurs to me that NetBeans was keeping something open and just needed to be closed in order to delete the folders.



Update
I finally figured out what was going on. Somehow, my NetBeans "Module Suite Project" (yellow/orange puzzle pieces icon) had been closed and the "Module Project" (purple puzzle piece icon) having the same exact name as the "Module Suite Project" was open. Building clean cleaned that particular Project  correctly, but did not clean the entire Suite. 

Now that I have the "Module Suite Project" opened correctly again, things work as expected. This explains why ant build clean worked, since it was done on the command line at the right level to clean the whole Suite.

I suspect I didn't strictly need to clean out my NetBeans cache at all though perhaps doing so actually fixed the issue of why it was only showing the "Module Project" instead of the "Module Suite Project", thereby doing the right thing when I clicked build clean... If I had simply realized that the Suite was no longer open and only the Project was, I could have fixed it in three seconds.
    
    
Answer 12: 

    
    
The cache is C:\Users\userName\AppData\Local\NetBeans\Cache\, and then the version name of the folder will specify the correct cache.

You can also do this: Close the IDE. Instead, of deleting files and risking everything, rename this cache folder. Now start the IDE. Once it starts, a new cache folder will be created since the folder is not found. Now you can delete the renamed folder safely.

I have tried this
UserName=radhason
C:\Users\radhason\AppData\Local\NetBeans\Cache

Press Ok button , then cache folder will be shown and delete this cache folder of netbeans.
    
    
Title: How to configure Eclipse build path to use Maven dependencies?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I would like to take advantage of the features that Maven provides for managing dependencies in a project. My brief understanding of how Maven works is that it will aquire the JARs needed and then build the project with these libraries.

Currently I have a simple POM file set up as a test:

&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" 
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd"&gt;
  &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.jamesgoodwin.test&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;com.jamesgoodwin.test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;build&gt;
  &lt;/build&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;3.0.0.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
  &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;


To manage dependencies, I usually add the project or JAR to the build path and then i'll be able to build my project.. 

But when using M2Eclipse the dependencies are not added automatically to the build path. Is there any configuration to let Eclipse know that the Maven is managing the dependencies?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you right-click on your project, there should be an option under "maven" to "enable dependency management". That's it.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
if you execute

mvn eclipse:clean


followed by

I'm assuming you are using m2eclipse as you mentioned it. However it is not clear whether you created your project under Eclipse or not so I'll try to cover all cases.

When m2eclipse is installed properly, it should add dependencies automatically.
However, you should generate the eclipse project files by entering:

mvn eclipse:m2eclipse


or, alternatively if you don't use m2eclipse:

mvn eclipse:eclipse

I had a slight variation that caused some issues - multiple sub projects within one project.

Answer 12: 

    
    
Adding my answers for a couple of reasons: 


Somehow none of the answers listed directly resolved my problem. 
I couldn't find "Enable dependency management" under Maven. I'm using Eclipse 4.4.2 build on Wed, 4 Feb 2015.


What helped me was another option under Maven called as "Update Project" and then when I click it this window opens which has a checkbox that says "Force update of Snapshot/Releases". The real purpose of this checkbox is different I know but somehow it resolved the dependencies issue. 

    
    
Answer 13: 

    
    
None of that solved my problem. but what I did was if click on the pom.xml, there is a tab at the bottom named dependencies. in this tab it is split into 2 section, one called dependencies and one called dependency management. select every thing in the dependency section and click add to be under the dependency management control. close and reopen your project.
    
    
Answer 14: 

    
    
Maybe you could look into maven-eclipse-plugin instead of M2Eclipse.

There you basically add maven-eclipse-plugin configuration to your pom.xml and then execute mvn eclipse:eclipse which will generate the required .project and .classpath files for Eclipse. Then you'll have the correct build path in Eclipse.
    
    
Answer 15: 

    
    
Make sure your POM follows the naming convention, and is named in lowercase lettering as pom.xml and NOT POM.xml.

In my case all was right, but Eclipse still complained when trying to Right-click and Update project configuration - told me that the POM could not be read. Changed the name to lowercase - pom.xml from POM.xml - and it worked.
    
    
Answer 16: 

    
    
I met this issue too. When I add dependencies in the pom.xml, I checked in the local folder /Users/xyz/.m2/ and the jars are already downloaded there, but cann't added the the buildpath of the eclipse.

Title: Sublime text 2 - find and replace globally ( all files and in all directories )
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there any way to find and replace text string automatically in all folder's files?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes, there is Multiple Files search and replace.

Press ctrlshiftF (cmdshiftF on MacOS):



In the Where field you can also add filters to search only folders and files that you need. If nothing is set, the search is made on all files listed in the sidebar.

If you double click on a line of the search result, Sublime will jump to that line.

Notice these icons in the search bar:



The first (show context) toggles context in result format (if enabled, some lines of text are shown before and after the matching line). The second allows to show the result in a new buffer, or in a console.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Press ctrlshiftF (cmdshiftF on  Mac OS X :) and then put *.* in the where: field 

This will open the search up to all files in the project as opposed to only open files or folders.

You can also use this to search only files of a certain type, or with a certain name regardless of type. It's just wildcards for the filename and extension.
    
    
Title: IntelliJ IDEA way of editing multiple lines
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've seen this done in TextMate and I was wondering if there's a way to do it in IDEA.

Say I have the following code:

 leaseLabel = "Lease";
 leaseLabelPlural = "Leases";
 portfolioLabel = "Portfolio";
 portfolioLabelPlural = "Portfolios";
 buildingLabel = "Building";


What is the best way to append '+ "foo"' to every line? Column mode won't work since the lines are not correctly aligned on the right side... unless there is an easy way to right justify the text :P
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Since Idea IntelliJ IDEA 13.1 there is possibility to edit multiple lines. 

Use: 

Alt + Shift + Mouse click

for selection. More about this new improvement in IntelliJ blogpost here. Very useful feature.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I use Column Selection Mode (Cmd+Shift+8 on Mac) which allows to create multiple cursors via Shift+Up or Shift+Down then edit all the lines together. 

Starting from IntelliJ IDEA 14 there is also Clone Caret Above / Below:


Windows: Ctrl, Ctrl+Up/Down
MacOS: Option,Option + Up/Down


(hold the second press of the modifier key, then press the arrow key)
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Another keyboard-only approach. It's possible (since 13.1 version) to use Alt+J / Shift+Alt+J (Ctrl+G for OS X) shortcuts for creating multiple carets. Alt+J selects the next occurrence of the currently selected text and adds another caret. 


Select the first semicolon





Then press Alt+J four times 





Edit what you want to





Press Esc to return to the first line.



    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Place caret at end
Windows: CTRL + CTRL(Hold) + ↑ / ↓
Mac: option + option(Hold) + ↑ / ↓.
To place caret at the end of rows: move caret to top row, clone down to bottom, and click END.
Change Multi-caret Hotkey
To add a custom Keymap, CTRL+SHIFT+A, type keymap and click on the one with Settings as subtext. Search for Clone Caret Above and Clone Caret Below.
I mapped mine to ALT+SHIFT+↑ / ↓ on Windows and ⌘+↑ / ↓ on Mac.
Bonus
Try holding combinations of CTRL, SHIFT, and arrows for improved selection power.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Column mode works just fine: first select all the lines in column mode, then press END: each cursor will jump to the end of respective line.
On Linux (NO MOUSE NEEDED):

ALT + SHIFT + INSERT to enter block-mode


SHIFT + UP or SHIFT + DOWN to select multiple lines


END to jump to the end of each line


now type foo, it will append it to each line:


Now deselect everything with ESCAPE and switch back to normal selection mode with ALT + SHIFT + INSERT.

It took me a while to find out, but on a Mac you can double-press Option (press it once, release, press it again, keep it pressed) and use Up/Down keys to create/remove carets as you wish.

Since WebStorm 2020.2 you can use AltShiftG to add carets at the end of each selected line.

The new action for working with multiple carets (Alt+Shift+G) lets you quickly place carets at the end of each selected line and removes the selection as soon as all carets are added.

What I usually use (NetBeans, but I believe it is simple to use in any IDE) is find&amp;replace.

You just find ;\n and replace it with + $foo;\n then you don't apply to ALL lines but you place cursor on the first line and you just hit "replace" button (depends on your IDE I suppose) 7 times to change 7 lines in no time. Easy and simple and it should be done with the most basic and the most advanced IDE you can find.

All the above answer are great, but if you want multiline edit at the end of lines then you have press &quot;End&quot; key while your multiline selection is active.
For Mac Sequence of command will be:

command right arrow  # go to the end of lines
This will do multiline select at the end of the line and you can edit it as required

You can set multiple carets from the search and replace tool.

Title: Intelli J IDEA takes forever to update indices
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is it normal for Intelli J to take a lot of time (almost 12 hours) to update indices for a project? I just installed Intelli J on my machine and imported a rather large Maven project (13k+ files). 

I understand that the project is large but I let my computer up all night and when I woke up in the morning, Intelli J still  hasn't finished updating the indices for the files yet, which makes it impossible to do anything since the popup with title 'Updating Index' keep hanging there in the middle of the screen.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There are several answers in the Forums for different IntelliJ Versions, here is what I´ve tried (IntelliJ 13).


Give more Memory. Does not help anything with the 'Updating indices'
Delete .idea and iml in project. Does not help.


In the end what resolved my problem with 'Updating indices' was:


delete 'caches' folder in user/.IntellIJIdea13/system/ 

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I tried deleting the cache and it works perfectly. Thanks for the solution friends.

Just:


Open IntelliJ IDEA
Select the File menu
Select the Invalidate Caches / Restart... menu.
Once selected you get a pop-up with a bunch of options.
Select Invalidate and Restart
and before doing that make sure you saved all your changes else it might delete some unsaved changes.


Once you hit that, IntelliJ will restart and then you can see that all the indexing is done really fast.

Answer 4: 

    
    
I had the same problem with IntelliJ 2017.2.3 - i.e. my project would keep updating indexes over and over again.

I discovered that I had gone over my disk quota in my home directory.  By default IntelliJ stores the indexes in the home directory like this:

~/.IdeaIC2017.2/system/index/


The solution for me was to:


Quit IntelliJ
Move the whole .IdeaIC2017.2 directory to another
mount which has more space:

mkdir /space/ideaConfig
mv ~/.IdeaIC2017.2 /space/ideaConfig/IdeaIC

Update bin/idea.properties to point at the new index/config location:

idea.config.path=/space/ideaConfig/IdeaIC/config

It is possible that some of the other answers to this question were due to the same problem and were inadvertently fixed by "deleting caches folder", "invalidating caches" etc which would have potentially freed up enough disk space to build the indexes.

Answer 6: 

    
    
Though the accepted and other answers may fix a particular problem, I have found that the problem with very long indexing times often comes from the fact that a repository contains or links to some directory that contains a large number of files. Often this is done for testing and the directory in question is not actually part of the project, e.g. ignored by the VCS. 

The IDE does not automatically ignore those directories when indexing, but it is possible to "exclude" the directory from the project. This will prevent indexing as well.

I guess Idea is more collecting garbage than doing useful work. Use G1 GC instead of the default. 

Help -- Edit Custom VM Options

-XX:+UseG1GC


instead of 

-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC


and of course restart Idea.

Downside: G1 tries to collect garbage before stopping the process. This is insane, but this is what it does. For a program with 16G of heap, cleaning-up took 27 minutes. So do not configure your Idea to use a 16G heap.

Title: Developing C# on Linux
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'd like to know if there are effective and open source tools to develop C# applications on Linux (Ubuntu). In particular, I have to develop Windows Forms applications.

I know about the Mono project, but I've never used it. What are the best tools (IDE, compiler, etc.) to set up a .NET developing environment on Ubuntu?

Is software developed on Linux runnable on Windows? Are there different behaviors or incompatibilities?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
MonoDevelop, the IDE associated with Mono Project should be enough for C# development on Linux. Now I don't know any good profilers and other tools for C# development on Linux. But then again mind you, that C# is a language more native to windows. You are better developing C# apps for windows than for linux.

EDIT: When you download MonoDevelop from the Ubuntu Software Center, it will contain pretty much everything you need to get started right away (Compiler, Runtime Environment, IDE). If you would like more information, see the following links:

I would suggest using MonoDevelop.

It is pretty much explicitly designed for use with Mono, and all set up to develop in C#.

The simplest way to install it on Ubuntu would be to install the monodevelop package in Ubuntu. (link on Mono on ubuntu.com) (However, if you want to install a more recent version, I am not sure which PPA would be appropriate)

However, I would not recommend developing with the WinForms toolkit - I do not expect it to have the same behavior in Windows and Mono (the implementations are pretty different). For an overview of the UI toolkits that work with Mono, you can go to the information page on Mono-project.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Mono Develop is what you want, if you have used visual studio you should find it simple enough to get started. 

If I recall correctly you should be able to install with sudo apt-get install monodevelop
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Mono is a runtime environment that can run .NET applications and that works on both Windows and Linux. It includes a C# compiler.

As an IDE, you could use MonoDevelop, and I suppose there's something available for Eclipse, too.

Note that WinForms support on Mono is there, but somewhat lacking. Generally, Mono developers seem to prefer different GUI toolkits such as Gtk#.

The standard "Mark Occurrences" functionality included in Eclipse that everyone recommends only highlights identifiers in editors of whatever language. For example, it won't highlight int in C editors, and it won't help at all in the Console pane.

So if you want to highlight ALL occurrences on ANY word in ANY Eclipse pane (kinda like Notepad++ does), try the Glance plug-in for Eclipse.

As of November 2017 Glance works for Eclipse Neon and Oxygen. There was a period of time in which Neon was unsupported, and a fork appeared, but it seems unnecessary now (and abandoned).

There are two ways to highlight all occurences. First is using Eclipse options, which is not very reliable, because in many versions of Eclipse it is not supported.
Second is using a plugin called Glance which is available in Eclipse marketplace. This is supereasy and effective.

First Method

In the toolbar, there is button for Toggling Mark Occurrences. So, once you selected the text/word whose occurences you wish to highlight, then click this toggle button.

Click the word and hold until a popup appears as shown in the figure. 
On the popup, there is a little right arrow, after clicking it, a new icon shows up.
Click that link to open preferences.
Once in preferences, select C/C++ Occurrences (it will be language specific) and select Include in next/previous navigation with Text as Highlighted.


This should enable the feature of highlighting all occurences of the selected word in the opened file.

Answer 1: 

    
    
In Visual Studio 2013 and later, this functionality is built in. ALT + UP/DOWN will move a line up or down.

If you need this functionality in VS2012 (works with VS2010 too), take a look at the MoveLine Visual Studio Extension or the Productivity Power Tools suite.

ReSharper's Ctrl + Shift + Alt + &uarr;/&darr;/&larr;/&rarr; is even more powerful - when on the beginning of the line, it will move the entire line, but can also be used to move entire methods, change the order of parameters, etc.

In Visual Studio 2013 and later, you can move lines up and down using Alt + &uarr; / Alt + &darr;. Unfortunately this will not adjust the indentation if you move between blocks, as of today only ReSharper (and all other IDE's by Jetbrains including Rider) can help you with that.

To move entire blocks of code around you can move the cursor to its head and press Ctrl + m twice fast to collapse it, and then use the command above to move it around.

If you want to run the #'.py' file

For eg. 

import os
os.getcwd()
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
name= 'Python'
# Use print() function
print(a)
print(name)

I am using Windows, so I'm not too sure if this command will work on Linux, or Mac, but it's worth a try.

Title: Where is the visual studio HTML Designer?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Where is the Visual Studio HTML Designer? I see that there are options for the HTML Designer but I can't open it.


So I just want to ask why I can't find the designer and how do I open it. When I create an HTML file it just goes to the HTML code.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The default HTML editor (for static HTML) doesn't have a design view. To set the default editor to the Web forms editor which does have a design view, 


Right click any HTML file in the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio and click on Open with
Select the HTML (web forms) editor
Click on Set as default
Click on the OK button


Once you have done that, all you need to do is click on design or split view as shown below:

Answer 1: 

    
    
In NetBeans model all project files should have the same encoding. The answer is that you can't do that in Netbeans.

If you are working in Netbeans you should consider to convert all files to a single encoding using other tools.

Yes, you can change the encoding of a specific file (or see what it has) with this Encoding Support plugin. With this plugin you will be able to handle the different encodings of your files without problems.

Just try to set the Projects Encoding to "UTF-8" and copy the file (which is encoded in iso) in the same Project (and if you dont need the old file just delete it) - now the copied file will be as UTF-8 - maybe this will help you :)
    
    
Title: Android Studio quick documentation always &ldquo;fetching documentation&rdquo;
Description: 
    
    
                    
I just move to Android studio from eclipse,I found that it always shows "fetching documentation" when I use quick documentation(Ctrl+Q),How to solve this?(I download documentation for API19,still problem)

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The problem is Android Studio does not automatically update the source link of reference even when the documentation is already downloaded.

The default link in jdk.table.xml is http://developer.android.com/reference/ (android studio tries to connect to this online server even if the network is blocked).

To solve the problem, we can just redirect the reference to local source.

MacOS

On MacOS, the config file jdk.table.xml is under 
~/Library/Preferences/AndroidStudio&lt;version&gt;/options/, and the docs are here:
~/Library/Android/sdk/docs/, or the custom path of your Android SDK.

In jdk.table.xml, find all the lines:

&lt;root type="simple" url="http://developer.android.com/reference/"&gt;


and modify them to

&lt;root type="simple" url="file://$USER_HOME$/Library/Android/sdk/docs/reference/"&gt;


Windows

On Windows, the file jdk.table.xml is under 
C:\Users\Name\.AndroidStudio&lt;version&gt;\config\options

In AndroidStudio 3.3, modify to

&lt;root type="simple" url="file://$USER_HOME$/AppData/Local/Android/sdk/docs/reference"  /&gt;


Android Studio (any os)

Then, in File -&gt; Invalidate Caches / Restart… select Invalidate, and retry using Quick Documentation. It should display instantly. If it doesn't, select Invalidate and Restart, and you should be good to go.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Go to: Tools &gt; Android &gt; SDK Manager. Select SDK Tools tab and:


if Documentation for Android SDK is unchecked, check it and click apply
If Documentation for Android SDK is checked, uncheck it and click apply. After uninstall completes check it again and click apply.

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
UPDATE: out-of-date, please check @Htea's answer.

I was having the same issue as you. Here's what fixed it for me:


Make sure you have the Documentation package downloaded in SDK Manager.
Exit Studio if it's running.
Delete the file named "jdk.table.xml" located in ~/.AndroidStudioX.Y/config/options/ (remember to take a backup first!).
Relaunch Android Studio. should work correctly now and it should regenerate the file automatically.


Note:


This worked for me on Ubuntu 14.04 &amp; Android Studio 0.8.11 (EDIT: Several users are reporting this solution also works for newer versions of Android Studio).
If it still doesn't work, try deleting and re-downloading the Documentation package from inside Android SDK Manager then try the above steps.
If you're running Windows, the file is located at "%UserProfile%.AndroidStudio\config\options", and if you're running OS X, it's located at "~/Library/Preferences/AndroidStudio/options" (credits to @Gero and @Alex Lipov).


Hope it helps.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
As other answers said, it's because the Android Studio is trying to fetch the javadoc online (from http://developer.android.com/reference/), which will be very slow if the network not good, especially in China because google is blocked. So we should change this setting and let Android Studio fetch javadoc locally:


Download Android SDK Documentation using the Android SDK Manager.
Open the file ~/Library/Preferences/AndroidStudio2.2/options/jdk.table.xml, see notes below to make sure the correct file is edited.
In the file jdk.table.xml, replace all http://developer.android.com/reference/ to the path to your sdk reference folder. For example file://$USER_HOME$/tools/adt-bundle-mac/sdk/docs/reference on my Mac.


On OS X, if you have used several versions of Android Studio, there may be several configuration folders for each version (under ~/Library/Preferences/), you should change the jdk.table.xml in the right folder, in my case I should edit jdk.table.xml under the folder AndroidStudio2.2.


    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
On Windows

File location of jdk.table.xml

C:\Users\[your windows user name]\.AndroidStudio2.3\config\options\jdk.table.xml


Notes


"." before AndroidStudio directory
version number after ".AndroidStudio". Be sure to edit the version number of Android Studio you're currently using.  Previous versions will still have directories here as well.




Line to edit

Before

&lt;root type="simple" url="http://developer.android.com/reference/" /&gt;


After

&lt;root type="simple" url="file://C:/Android/sdk/docs/reference" /&gt;


Notes


C:/Android/sdk/docs/reference replace with Android SDK location on your machine
if you're copy/pasting location from File Explorer, replace backslashes (\) with forward slashes (/)
Each installed Android SDK version will have its own docs XML entry
Edit the line above in each SDK version found in jdk.table.xml (if you want quick docs when targeting those versions in build.gradle). e.g. If you have Android SDK API 25 installed, you'd find a section to edit under &lt;name value="Android API 25 Platform" /&gt;

Webstorm is correct. My front end code is all in /app but my server serves up files in app on the root, so in the web context /app is actually just /. As a side, this behavior also impacts my angular templates:



and my angular-ui routes (I imagine it would do that for regular angular routes as well).



Is there a way that I can change webstorm to treat /app as the root so this is a useful feature? If not, is there a way I can disable this? I tried going into the inspector, but couldn't find an option for it:

Title: Eclipse syntax highlighting preferences save and restore
Description: 
    
    
                    
I spend some time customizing the colors for syntax highlighting in Eclipse (Java, JSP, HTML, CSS, etc.) but whenever I try to export these settings via File|Export|General|Preferences and reimport them, the settings never completely get imported back. Some colors are restored and others are left unchanged, leaving me in an 'in between' state - very frustrating.

I'm using Eclipse 3.4 Ganymede, by the way.

Has anyone found a reliable way to save and restore Eclipse syntax highlighting settings?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I finally figured out how to do this.

I just wanted to mention beforehand that I did try to start with a fresh Eclipse install, export the preferences to a .epf file, change just one single setting, export again, and compare the files. To my surprise, trying to import settings from a minimal .epf file did not work reliably either.

The solution that worked for me was to copy these files: {Eclipse workspace directory}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/*.prefs

I tried a fresh Eclipse install on another machine and after copying those files over, all my settings were restored perfectly.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The solution was to copy SOME - not all - of the files from {workspace}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/*.prefs into my other workspace. 

In particular (per the https://stackoverflow.com/questions/96981/color-themes-for-eclipse thread):

org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs = Syntax Coloring    
org.eclipse.ui.editors.prefs = Text Editors


Copying other files caused things to break.

There are a couple of notes to add:


 I had to copy the aforementioned pair of files several times before I got the correct syntax coloring.
 Be sure to close the workspace, if it's open in Eclipse, before copying the files.


This worked with Eclipse Helios.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If you want to be a little more fine grained on what you migrate, the syntax highlighting rules are the lines starting with semanticHighlighting on workspace-indigo/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs

Doing this, I was able to migrate my syntax highlighting from Helios to Indigo
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I'm using JBoss Developer Studio 10 with the Eclipse Neon 4.6 engine.

All .prefs files are inside this path:

/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.sett‌​ings



  Update: I found a similar structure on  this path too:
  
  \RedHat\JBossDev\studio\configuration\.settings
  
  It's my IDE folder plus \configuration\.settings


I recommend search for org.eclipse.*ui*.prefs instead *.prefs to refine your result.

The principal config files are:


org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs


Java Syntax Color Settings

org.eclipse.ui.editors.prefs


Text Editor Settings

org.eclipse.cdt.ui.prefs


Formatter Settings

org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.ui.prefs


JavaScript Syntax Color Settings

org.eclipse.jst.jsp.ui.prefs
org.eclipse.wst.css.ui.prefs
org.eclipse.wst.html.ui.prefs
org.eclipse.wst.json.ui.prefs
org.eclipse.wst.dtd.ui.prefs
org.eclipse.wst.xml.ui.prefs
org.eclipse.wst.xsl.ui.prefs




If have a problematic workspace:


Copy the files above
Create a new workspace
Copy and Replace that files in your new workspace


This will recover perfectly your custom editors color settings. For me worked very well.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Eclipse CDT stores 'Syntax coloring' in the file org.eclipse.cdt.ui.prefs

This is located for example here: C:\eclipse\workspace.metadata.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime.settings\

Copy and paste over the top of the one in your new eclipse instance. This worked for me when moving from 3.4 to 3.5
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I would export the preference before modifying the color, and then after.

That way, you would be able to isolate the specific rules of an eclipse preference file into one smaller file and:


check if some colors not restored are indeed represented by a rule
the import of a smaller preference has any effect on the previously unchanged settings.


That kind of strategy can be further refined into several small settings files (one for Java, one for JSP, HTML, CSS, ...), in order to better analyzing the potential side-effects when re-importing those settings.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
I have had success in importing Eclipse Helios's syntax highlighting rules by copying the file:

Answer 8: 

    
    
Once Michael Bosworth's answer helped me to some extend and I voted up. But now I see some obligation to answer it myself, because copying these two files are not enough. Let me explain why.


First, these files contains lines irrevelente to syntax coloring.
Second, syntax coloring for other editors are located elsewhere, for example, those of XML files are in 

org.eclipse.wst.xml.ui.prefs


and those of HTML files:

    org.eclipse.wst.html.ui.prefs


JSP pages? 

    org.eclipse.jst.jsp.ui.prefs


, etc. 


Third, when we change font colors, usually we change background colors, line highlighting colors, etc. to get a clearer view of codes. This involves more files. 


If we search *.pref files in path

/workspace/.metadata/.plugins


we can find all preferences files where we can locate all lines of coloring settings. But by copy-pasting all these files to another workspace can also trigger problems, for they are not exclusively syntax-coloring-related. Moreover, when we are switching between two versions of Eclipse, unexpected problems may arise. 

So, the safest way is:


Create a new workspace if you don't have one.
Open all *.pref files we find in the workspace one by one,
Copy those lines containing color codes,
Find the same file in your new workspace,
Replace the color part by existing one. Or, set the colors in Eclipse, by assuming the corresponding options according to properties' name. All color codes are RGB based.


EDIT: (2017.02.24)

Eclipse Mars has a plugin Oomph, which can record your preference settings to provide seamless transmission of your preferences. When you activate it, every time you change a value, it prompts to ask you if you want to record it in Oomph, providing you the exact line in the corresponding file where your new value is stored. So, when you install Oomph, you can:


Change the settings of your font face, font size, background color, etc.
In the prompt windows of Oomph, take note of the location of your new settings. (Because if you tell Oomph to remember your settings, it will not prompt never again, so you may only see this windows once.)

B. Remove from the recent project panel of Phpstorm 2018.3

Actually you cannot DELETE a project by pressing "delete" or "backspace" (or clicking the "x" in the upper right corner) in the recent projects list. These operations will only remove the project from being listed in the recent projects list.

You can check this out by looking at the project folders in the directory that WebStorm creates under your user name.

By the way I have WebStorm v.10 running on Win 7 x64 and none of the steps listed here by other users allow me to actually delete a project. The only way I have found out is manual.

This would work in at least Windows 7:

Navigate to the "WebstormProjects" directory under your Windows user name, and delete the project directory. This will remove it from the recent projects list the next time you launch WebStorm.

year 2019. PhpStorm v2018.3.5 - can't detach the project after attached. There's no &quot;Close Project&quot; in File menu, and no &quot;Remove from Project View&quot; in context menu as documentation says. Seems like a bug.
Just can't get rid of that extra project I've attached. Only one thing helped: removal of the .idea sub directory.
important note: it's about project Attach when you can't remove it from the Project view.
UPDATE/SOLVED:
Here's how to remove accidentally attached project from the current Project view:

.idea/modules.xml

you can either edit that file (remove that new/added entry, easy to find) or remove that entire file (don't worry, it will be re-created on restart).

Also it could've been added to .idea/vcs.xml (don't remove it, just find the corresponding &lt;mapping ...&gt; entry in it and remove, it's under VscDirectoryMappings)

Also it can be listed in .idea/&lt;projectname&gt;.iml file (find it in module &gt; component &gt; orderEntry, see module-name attribute), remove from there too.

restart the PhpStorm.


you will see no attached projects again.
I didn't find any UI options to do this (Mac OS Catalina, PhpStorm 2020.1, same on previous/older versions).

In my dynamic web project in eclipse, I have jQuery in my js source folder.  For some reason, Eclipse is not handling it correctly and interpreting many lines as errors in the standard jQuery file (even though I have the javascript development tools installed).

It looks like eclipse has changed a bit,
but the following method which worked for me seems very close to the old one.

The solution consists of 2 steps:


First you have to update Eclipse's preferences (Window &gt; Preferences):



Make sure that you check both Manual &amp; Build next to the Validator you need
(in my case - a javascript one).
Last you should change your project's Validators:



Click on Client-side JavaScript Settings (or any other validator you need):



The explanation is clear but basically what you should do is as follows:

Click on Add Exclude Group..., select it and then click on Add rule....
Then pick Folder or file name (note that there are other options), and specify your file/folder.


You should be able to verify that its working by deleting the existing errors/warnings,
and then left-click your project and select the Validate option.

This setting can be committed into source control as well.

Title: LLVM C++ IDE for Windows
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there some C/C++ IDE for Windows, which is integrated with the LLVM compiler (and Clang C/C++ analyzer), just like modern Xcode do.

I have Dev-Cpp (it uses outdated GCC) and Code::Blocks (with some GCC). But GCC gives me very cryptic error messages. I want to get some more user-friendly error messages from the Clang frontend.

Yes, Clang was not able to be used with complex C++ code, but trunk Clang  already can compile LLVM itself. So I wonder if is there any of LLVM IDEs in development or in beta versions.

Yes, I can use Clang as other compiler with GCC-compatible IDEs. But is there any IDE, that are integrated with Clang? Clang have a different output format, so the IDE must parse it. Clang can provide IDE parsing of sources. Clang has an analyze option, which must be supported in an IDE. Take a look, e.g http://iosdevelopertips.com/xcode/static-code-analysis-clang-and-xcode-3-2.html

And the most wanted feature of Clang - is smart auto-completion, so the IDE can suggest only syntaxilly-correct variants, e.g. list only fields of this struct, class.

LLVM is supported in Eclipse CDT via plug-in (llvm4eclipsecdt). It is the only Windows supported IDE supporting LLVM as far as I know. I am the main author of the plug-in so you can ask any questions related to it.

The plug-in offers the basic functionality for Clang and llvm-gcc compilation and support Linux and Windows (w/ Cygwin &amp; MiNGW). LLVM tools such as assembler, archiver, linker, and static compiler (llc) are configured and can be customized via UI. The plug-in offers all the benefits that IDE can offer such as easy configuration and building with one action. 

The only drawback is that it is not ready yet as it lacks of some of the advanced features that LLVM can offer such as Clang analyze and smart auto-completion. The plug-in is also not tested well and may not work perfectly therefore I hope I can get user feedback via mailing list found from Google code development site (listed below). I wish I had time to develop it further. I only develop it in my spare time, which is very limited. I welcome any developers to participate and contribute to the project.

There isn't one for windows. But if you want smart auto-completion, netbeans has one of the best code completions for C++. It parses macros, generic containers, and smart pointers. Plus it provides refactoring, code insertion of constructors and getters and setters. It works really well. However, since it still uses a separate parser for C++, it doesn't catch as many errors as the compiler does.

Netbeans for java is integrated in with the compiler, so it gives errors and warnings as you type, as well as syntactically correct code completion. So, netbeans will very likely in the future integrate with clang to provide the same kind of features for C++.

Not quite an IDE, but kind of a crossover between IDE and plain editor, a usable alternative for those who don't mind writing configs by hand: a combo of Sublime Text 3 editor and EasyClangComplete plugin (plus Clang Format to keep your code neat and tidy). Works well on Windows thanks to recent efforts to make LLVM MSVC-compatible (Clang-cl is also capable of generating compatible .PDBs as of 2018, which is crucial for debugging).

Update: As of 2019, a much better and future-proof alternative to EasyClangComplete is using Clangd via LSP plugin.

I've been using Lisp on and off for a while but I'm starting to get more serious about doing some "real" work in Lisp. I'm a huge Vim fan and was wondering how I can be most productive using Vim as my editor for Lisp development. Plugins, work flow suggestions, etc. are all welcome.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Limp aims to be a fully featured Common Lisp IDE for Vim. It defaults to SBCL, but can be changed to support most other implementations by replacing "sbcl" for your favourite lisp, in the file /usr/local/limp/latest/bin/lisp.sh

When discussing Lisp these days, it is commonly assumed to be Common Lisp, the language standardized by ANSI X3J13 (see the HyperSpec, and Practical Common Lisp for  a good textbook) with implementations such as GNU Clisp, SBCL, CMUCL, AllegroCL, and many others.

Back to Limp.  There are other solutions that are more light-weight, or try to do other things, but I believe in providing an environment that gives you things like bracket matching, highlighting, documentation lookup, i.e. making it a turn-key solution as much as possible.

In the Limp repository you'll find some of the previous work of the SlimVim project, namely the ECL (Embeddable Common Lisp) interface, merged with later releases (7.1); Simon has also made patches to 7.2 available yet to be merged. The ECL interface is documented in if_ecl.txt.

Short-term work is to do said merging with 7.2 and submit a patch to vim_dev to get it merged into the official Vim tree.

Which leads us to the long-term plans: having Lisp directly in Vim will make it convenient to start working on a SWANK front-end (the part of SLIME that runs in your Lisp, with slime.el being the part that runs in the editor - the frontend).

And somewhere in between, it is likely that all of Limp will be rewritten in Common Lisp using the ECL interface, making Limp easier to maintain (VimScript isn't my favourite) and being easier for users to customize.

The official Limp site goes down from time to time, but as pointed out, the download at Vim.org should always work, and the support groups limp-devel and limp-user are hosted with Google Groups.  Don't hesitate to join if you feel you need a question answered, or perhaps even want to join in on development.  Most of the discussion takes place on the limp-devel list. If you're into IRC, I'm in #limp on irc.freenode.net as 'tic'.

SLIME for EMACS is a wonderful tool for LISP programming.  The best part is sending code written in your editor straight to a live LISP session.  You can get similar behavior out of Vim using the tips here:

http://technotales.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/like-slime-for-vim/

I adjusted my own script so that I can send to either a SBCL or Clojure session.  It makes you much more productive and takes advantage of the REPL.

":set lisp"  starts the lisp indentation mode for Vim.  But it won't work with some dialects like Clojure.  For Clojure, use VimClojure.

Title: .classpath and .project - check into version control or not?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm running an open source java project that consists of multiple modules in a tree of dependencies. All those modules are subdirectories in a subversion repository. For newcomers to our project, it's a lot of work to set all that up manually in eclipse. 

Not all our developers use eclipse. Nevertheless, we're considering to just check in the .classpath and .project files to help newcomers to get started. Is this a good idea? Or would that lead to constant conflicts in those files? Is there an alternative way to make the project easy to set up on eclipse?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Definitively yes, as I said in "Do you keep your project files under version control?"


  "Load it up, set it up, go."


But... this is actually true only for recent Eclipse3.5 settings, where build paths support relative paths:





And Eclipse3.6 would be better, as it supports relative paths for path variables in Linked Resources:


(since 3.6M5)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Definitely no - it's generally terrible idea to distribute project files via subversion. Especially since someone might modify them in a some strange manner. A good page in the project's documentation is a much better idea. Our project also has many modules and a complex setup. We've set up a confluence page describing how to get started with the project on each populer IDE - IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans. A README file in Subversion contains the same info.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I vote no, but that's because I would generally generate these files from maven
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
In my experience, excluding the limited cases where purely local settings are involved, everything should be in source control.  The law of source control is that everything pushed in should be expected to work by those who pull out.  Unfortunately, eclipse often causes things like this to be in .classpath:

    &lt;classpathentry kind="con" 
      path="org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER/org.eclipse.jdt.internal.launching.macosx.MacOSXType/Java SE 7"/&gt;


So on my Mac this works, and maybe someone on a Mac has the same JRE, but this will not work for anyone else. 

Also, there's no easy way around this.  Eclipse will always add that in.  I WANT to have the .classpath file in there, because there are some 3rd party JARs in our lib folder where we care about versioning, so we leave them in there so new developers do not have to get them.  We're moving to a managed system, but still have managed+unmanaged dependencies checked in.  This means all the developers just have to ensure two directories are in their .classpaths.  But it's better than having to fix your JRE every single time you pull and have a change in  your .classpath every single time you commit.

Eclipse does some other nice things for you though.  The .project file will usually be the same across instances, so include that.  But the best thing about source control for eclipse is the Run Configurations settings.  Under the "Common" tab in the Run Configurations dialog, save the configurations so they appear for your colleagues under the favorites lists for Debug and Run.  For me, a bunch of .launch files go in the .settings directory, so we can all use them.

So I say: .settings directory goes into source control for launch configs (except *.prefs)

.classpath stays out

.project goes in.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I would check theese files in to make the start for new users as easy as possible. At best the user should check out the project and should be able to run it without extra knowledge. For this files the rules are the same as for other files in the project: handle them with care. You should not place absolute pathes in the source code, neigther you should in the configuration files.

If the files are checked in in a way that the project runs from scratch there should not be much forces to change them.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I would recommend that you check the files into subversion IF they do not contain absolute paths and other data which would tie them directly to a single developer's environment.

If the files do contain absolute paths and the like, a README would be a better choice.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Yes, definitely check them in, but make sure that you document any path dependencies and avoid absolute paths if possible.

If you don't check them in, then anyone checking the project out will need to recreate all of those settings, which is annoying and potentially error prone.

Some complex setups may be better handled by a script to generate these files, but usually it is better to just check them in.
    
    
Title: Managing keyboard shortcut conflicts between IDE and OS (Ubuntu)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using IntelliJ IDEA, but I think this applies to any IDE.

In IDEA, some very useful keyboard shortcuts conflict with Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts. Some examples:


Ctrl+Alt+L : formats the source code (mapped to "Lock Screen" in Ubuntu)
Ctrl+Alt+Left : navigates backward (mapped to "switch to workspace on the left of the current workspace" in Ubuntu)
...


I've been using Ubuntu for a long time, and I'm used to these shortcuts. I use them all the time to switch between workspaces, lock my session... At the same time, I know how useful the IntelliJ shortcuts can be, and I want to avoid using the mouse as much as possible.

Currently, my workaround for "format source code" is Alt+D (opens the "Code" menu), followed by "R" ("Reformat Code"). It works okay, since I don't format code that often, but it could be better. There is no real alternative for Ctrl+Alt+Left, though.

How do you manage these conflicts in your IDE?

Do you simply remap all the conflicting IDE keyboard shortcuts to something else (and then get lost when you are pair programming with a colleague with different shortcuts...)?

Do you remap the Linux keyboard shortcuts (even though you are "used" to them)?

Is there a way to make keyboard shortcuts "contextual"? By this, I mean: hit a key to go into "IDEA mode" when coding (all conflicting Ubuntu shortcuts are temporarily deactivated), hit the key again to go back to "Standard mode" (Ubuntu shortcuts are reactived).

Do you have any other ideas / tips on how to manage this problem?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I use Ubuntu as well and I disabled the native (Ubuntu) command Ctrl + Alt + L because I prefer IntelliJ's format code than this native Ubuntu command. However, in the 2nd case I prefered Ubuntu's shortcut so I didn't change anything. 

So basically, you can choose which option you need more and then act accordingly. 

Of course, until IDEA becomes Ubuntu friendly. 

In the end, Ubuntu will always prefer its shortcuts and so far I haven't found any tool that can disable native shortcuts on request.

There is a feature request to provide Ubuntu friendly keymap.

What to remap, IDEA or Linux keys? Decide yourself depending on what you are using more often. I guess you reformat code more often than lock screen? So remap Linux and leave IDEA default keyboard shortcut.

You can just use the super (aka Windows Key) in combination with your intellijidea shortcut, in order to leave the default shortcuts for Ubuntu.

So, you can just 

Ctrl  + Alt  +  WinKey  + L 
to format the code and

Ctrl  + Alt  +  WinKey  + Left 
for navigating backward

Hope this helps

This works for me in Ubuntu Studio 14.04 (XFCE):


Open Windows Manager: xfwm4-settings
Go to Keyboard tab
Scroll down to conflicting Action
Hit Clear button or change action to different shortcut

From the link to feature request provided by CrazyCoder:


  Actually, there are several bundled schemes: "Default for GNOME", "Default for KDE" created exactly for that purpose.
  I have not checked now particular shortcuts like Ctrl+Alt+L, but these schemes were created to avoid conflicts with GNOME and KDE respectively.


"Default for Gnome" did the trick for me (I'm on ArchLinux, Gnome3, AndroidStudio/InteliJ), it remapped Navigate/Back to Shift+Alt+Left (was Ctrl+Alt+Left from "Default for XWin" and it didn't work).

But now it switches may keyboard layout as well (Shift+Alt), another problem )) Probably I'll remap keypad switcher to something else, it is still simpler then reassigning all the conflicting keys in IDE/OS.

In 'Settings' section 'Keymap' you can choose the keymaps template from XWin, Gnome, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc... This solve any problem in Ubuntu by choosing Gnome.
    
    
Title: PhpStorm very slow and sluggish on netbook, optimize IDE for responsiveness?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I recently upgraded from PhpStorm 6 to PhpStorm 7. Delighted to see all the improvements, but it runs awfully slow on my low-powered netbook. The delay between typing and seeing text appear is often 5-6 seconds and gets worse as line count increases. It is unusable at this stage.

How can I improve the general IDE speed and responsiveness?

Edit 2017: You may first want to try experimenting with allocating PhpStorm some more RAM if available. Do this by


Going to Help -&gt; Edit Custom VM Options
Change -Xms and -Xmx to be something reasonable for your hardware. I have -Xms512m and -Xmx2048m on an 8GB RAM laptop.
Restart PhpStorm.
If you want to see how much RAM PhpStorm is currently using, you can go to File -&gt; Settings and search for and enable show memory indicator.


Original answer: I made some changes to increase the responsiveness of the IDE. I'm sure there are more things one could do, but I found these to improve the performance to well within usable margins. From most effective to least:

Add these to your phpstorm.exe.vmoptions or phpstorm64.exe.vmoptions file, at the bottom:

-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=lcd
-Dawt.java2d.opengl=true


Solid speedup to the point that the editor is now actually usable.

I will for the life of me just never understand why people create editors in Java.

Try removing unnecessary files from your project.
I had 3k+ *.html log files inside my project and that slowed down typing terribly when the 'Project' tab was open. (Hiding the project tab or turning off the PHP Plugin does also speeds up PHPStorm, but obviously those are not viable trade-offs.) (I'm using PHPStorm 2016)

In my case, PhpStorm wasn't slow at all - a bug in my monitor driver introduced severe lag, and it just happened that I dedicated that monitor to PhpStorm. If you've read this far, try PhpStorm on a different monitor, it would've saved me a lot of time.

It is possible that it will help to increase the maximum memory allocation for PhpStorm beyond its default.

For mine, it was capped at 2GB. I know you asked about a windows machine, but for mac users reading this, you can change this by opening PhpStorm without opening a project. Then hit Configure /p/div

I don't know a way to do this en mass, but if you delete all imports from a source file and then right click in the source editor, you can select fix imports. This will import all the classes for you alphabetically, asking when it encounters package ambiguities.

As Soldier.moth pointed out, Netbeans will point out other issues, like casts and override annotations, in line, by use of a light bulb to the left of the source.

Bug 58945: CTabFolder should support multi row and vertical style options, opened since 2004! (other bugs exist on the same topic)
(Update Feb. 2017: it seems to be assigned, with Oxygen 4.7 as target!
Thank you specializt for mentioning that in the comments)
CTRL+F6 is one workaround for now.
Other &quot;workarounds&quot; are listed in this thread:

turn on the &quot;close editors automatically&quot; option (preferences &gt; General &gt; editors), which will close editors automatically when the limit is reached an a new editor is to be opened.
make use of multiple windows each with a set of editors for areas you are editing or browsing or searching
CTRL+Shift+W to close all tabs quickly


As mention by Big Chair in the comments:

Someone made a workaround here: &quot;Eclipse multiple tab rows&quot;

Wes explains:

I've discovered that while it is true that you cannot have multiple rows of tabs for the same code-space, it is possible to have multiple rows of tabs showing on your window at the same time:
To accomplish this, simply drag a tab up to your title bar and release. It will create another row of tabs.
