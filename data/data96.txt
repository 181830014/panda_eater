Title: Is there a technical term for the part of an IDE which maintains a dynamic symbol table as you code?
Description: 
    
    
                    
My context is MSVC 6.

Starting with a successfully compiled program, with browse information built, I can go into a existing function and hover over a variable, and the IDE will show me the data type, and variable name.   One could well imagine that the information is coming from the browse file.

In practice, If I create a new variable.

int z;


and hover over the z, the IDE will show me the data type and variable name.  I have not compiled the program yet, hence the browse file has not been updated.  This seems to say,
that there is a portion of the IDE, which watches as you type, and stays aware of the datatypes and functions as you enter them.   For all I know, it may compile them internally as well.

I have also noticed, that syntax errors can effectively disable this functionality.

I haven't seen this discussed anywhere.   Is there a term for this sort of functionality?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It's probably the lexical analysis and syntactic analysis at work and building up it's own symbol table. It's part of the parsing phase of most compilers.  That would explain why the functionality breaks when you see syntax errors.  The parsing needs to occur successfully to have a reliable symbol table.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
In compilers, its usually called a symbol table.

I'm not sure that there's a term common to all integrated development environments.
    
    
Title: Manipulating Access VBA IDE methods from VBScript
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to write a VBScript that will export and import the code modules from an Access MDB file to text files.

From within the app I can loop through the DAO Container &amp; Documents and use the 'undocumented' Application.SaveAsText method, but can I do it externally?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Basically it is all COM, but the COM interface doesn't expose methods for opening files, using MDWs for security, etc, but minds greater than my own have found a solution to the problem at http://www.mvps.org/access/modules/mdl0036.htm.
Once I've got a reference to the database, I can then use the techniques Remou and HansUp mention as normal.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
It's all COM, so pretty much anything you can do from VBA in the IDE, you can do from a .vbscript file externally.

Set accessApplication = CreateObject("Access.Application")
' then do what you do from the IDE

I'm used to using Idle for Python development, but decided to give Visual Studio 2010 + IronPython a try last week.  It seems to work fine, but I noticed that triple-quoted (multi-line) strings don't highlight correctly in the editor.  See photo:

This is a bug that is already fixed for the next release - I screwed up storing our state while processing line-by-line when fixing another bug.  

If you're really anxious you can actually build the MSI which includes the tools from the sources on CodePlex.  Once you have the VS SDK installed it should be as simple as running Scripts\Bat\Dev.bat to setup the enlistment environment and then msbuild Msi\Installer.proj which will produce an MSI in Bin\Debug.
    
    
Title: How to set up a large and complex Java web project so that &ldquo;trial-and-error&rdquo; isn&#39;t terrible waste of time?
Description: 
    
    
                    
This question is something like a holy grail of project environment setting. Here goes a rationale:

Big projects tends to have poor documentation so there are a lot of trial-and-error cycles. Therefore I often use the reload-without-redeploy feature of some libraries (facelets, webflow, tapestry, jrebel...).

The easiest way to use such feature is to have the same structure in VCS as is in servlet container and point servlet container directly to the development directory.

However big projects are also often divided into some kind of modules to avoid too much complexity. This means that directory structure is very different in VCS and in the web container. Right now I even have a situation where I have two projects sharing the same core project which I need to develop simultaneously.

If the project is small enough, I'm using incremental building with ant that is run by Eclipse on save of any file. But if there are several thousands of files where timestamp needs to be compared or some other time consuming action is run, than even incremental build can be quite annoying.

The only thing that would make incremental builds faster (and therefore makes development MUCH MORE enjoyable) is some kind of IDE save action hooks that would supply ant more information about what is saved so that ant can avoid unnecessary work.

If you have ever though about this, please share your thoughts with me - your favorite project setting, IDE tips, trial-and-error strategy criticism, whatever.

For example I recently noticed the new "Web Deployment Assembly" feature, but I don't know how it can be used to make deployment dir structure synchronized with development dir structure during DEVELOPMENT, not build.

Thanks

I'm not sure about Eclipse, but with IntelliJ IDEA you can set up a project so that the project directories (i.e. "modules") are arranged however you want, and it will keep the output directory in sync with them, updating them as changed, and even doing a hot-deploy automatically.

Title: What is the difference between building C++ Builder project from IDE and command line?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have different behaviour of compiler, when building project from IDE and from command-line, which I can not explain. 

The detailed issue's description is rather big, but it's really simple.

I have a C++ Builder project, which has a PAS-file included (IncludeUnits.pas). This pas-file has several units and inc-files listed. These files are located in separate folders and these folders are listed in library&amp;include paths in project's options.

Folders layout:


  C:\Demo\Bin
  C:\Demo\Project
  C:\Demo\Project\CBuilder5
  C:\Demo\Project\Common
  C:\Demo\Source
  C:\Demo\Source\Common


Bin is output folder, Project/CBuilder5 holds project (bpr-file), Project/Common holds included pas-file (IncludeUnits.pas), Source and Source/Common hold other files (pas&amp;inc). I think that it's pretty usual layout.

C:\Demo\Project\Common\ IncludeUnits.pas :

unit IncludeUnits;

interface

uses
  Test;

implementation

end.


C:\Demo\Source\ Test.pas :

unit Test;

interface

{$I Test.inc}

implementation

end.


C:\Demo\Source\Common\ Test.inc :

// this file is empty


If I compile this project from C++ Builder IDE - it will compile fine. C++ Builder IDE doesn't have any additional paths in IDE settings set.

Now, I want to compile it from command-line. First, I issue


  bpr2mak.exe MyProject.bpr


command.

This command creates MyProject.mak file, where I can see all paths ("....\Source" and "....\Source\Common" are the paths in question):


  ...
  INCLUDEPATH = $(BCB)\include;$(BCB)\include\vcl;..\Common;..\..\Source;..\..\Source\Common
  LIBPATH = $(BCB)\lib\obj;$(BCB)\lib;..\Common;..\..\Source;..\..\Source\Common
  ...


Now, I run make command:


  make.exe -B -f"MyProject.mak"


It gives me the following output:


  C:\PROGRA~1\Borland\CBUILD~2\BIN\dcc32 -N2....\Bin -N0....\Bin -$Y+ -$W -$R -v -JPHNE -M -UC:\PROGRA~1\Borland\CBUILD~2\bin..\include;C:\PROGRA~1\Borland\CBUILD~2\bin..\include\vcl;..\Common;..\..\Source;..\..\Source\Common -D_DEBUG;_RTLDLL;NO_STRICT -OC:\PROGRA~1\Borland\CBUILD~2\bin..\include;C:\PROGRA~1\Borland\CBUILD~2\bin..\include\vcl;..\Common;..\..\Source;..\..\Source\Common --BCB ..\Common\IncludeUnits.PAS
  Borland Delphi  Version 13.0  Copyright (c) 1983,99 Inprise Corporation
  C:\Demo\Project\Common\IncludeUnits.pas(1) C:\Demo\Project\Common\IncludeUnits.pas(1) C:\Demo\Project\Common\IncludeUnits.pas(1) C:\Demo\Project\Common\IncludeUnits.pas(6) C:\Demo\Source\Test.pas(1)                 C:\Demo\Source\Test.pas(5) Fatal: File not found: 'Test.inc'


As you can see - all search path is passed to compiler and the file (Test.inc) is all here - in that Source\Common folder. But still compiler can't find it?

Of course, I run both commands from folder with bpr-file. And changing paths to absolute doesn't help. 

Copying Test.inc from Source\Common to Source will help. Changing {$I Test.inc} to {$I Common\Test.inc} will also help.

Why? It seems that I'm missing something. Remember: project have no problems with compiling from IDE, Test.inc is found without copying or changing declaration. Did I miss some switch to make or dcc32?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I found the reason: command line for dcc32 misses -I switch, which specifies paths for include files. 

For some reason, bpr2mak doesn't respect this option. Fortunately, it allows you to specify alternate template for conversion bpr -/p/div
Title: Visual Studio IDE Customisation - Breakpoint string highlighting
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to make my IDE fonts and colours more visible, but I'm stuck on one last detail: the string highlighting for selected breakpoints.

Given the following example:

Session["mySessionVar"] = someValue;


The text for "mySessionVar" - including the quote marks - has (in my case) yellow text on a bright pink background - almost impossible to read.  My problem is I can't find any way to set the Breakpoint (Enabled) strings, keys or parameters to a more readable setting.

Can it even be done?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'm guessing you've tried changing the various "Breakpoint" settings in Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Environment-&gt;Fonts and Colors, but even those wouldn't leave the string a different color than any other text in the breakpoint.  The intent, for breakpoints, is that the foreground color of everything in the breakpoint is overridden by the breakpoint foreground color.

Do you have an extension installed that changes the formatting for comments, or did you get into this state just from changing around options in Fonts and Colors?
    
    
Title: Tool to Surround or Wrap Highlighted Text
Description: 
    
    
                    
StackOverflow's WYSIWYG has the ability to quickly surround highlighted text through keyboard shortcuts.

For example, when I push Ctrl+B on some highlighted text, it would bold the text or surround it with two stars.

I am looking for a tool that will give me this function but with "custom-input". That is... instead of bolding the word, I could surround it with a &lt;div&gt; tag or... in my case, I need to localize my Wordpress Plug-in, thus __("Surrounded Text").

I am currently using Notepad++ but I can't find any way to create this function.

Can this be done in Notepad++?
If it can not, I would like some suggestion for a IDE that can.

Thank you.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you've never used an "optimized" text editor, Vim would be a sea change, but it does have a great surround.vim plugin.


  Emphasize hello: ysiw&lt;em&gt;
  
  &lt;em&gt;Hello&lt;/em&gt; world!
  
  Finally, let's try out visual mode.
  Press a capital V (for linewise visual
  mode) followed by S&lt;p
  class="important"&gt;.
  
  &lt;p class="important"&gt;
       &lt;em&gt;Hello&lt;/em&gt;&gt; world!
  &lt;/p&gt;




Alternatively, you could probably get a fair bit of the functionality for which you are looking with an AutoHotkey script, but at best I think you'd have to do the highlight-first thing like the StackOverflow WYSIWYG editor.

Still, this would probably allow you to keep using Notepad++.

It doesn't directly awnser your question but I would recommend using http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/ (Xtext).

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It depends on what you want out of an editor/IDE.

Some of the issues with Aptana and PHP are due to the switch from using a custom version of PHP support to PDT between version 1.5 to 2.0. Aptana Studio 3 instead reverts back to a custom plugin for improved integration and support.

For alternatives, many people use Eclipse + PDT.

Alternately, if you want a paid version, then there is Zend Studio, or perhaps PHPStorm.

Coda, TextMate, and others will behave closer to an editor, and will have limited support for things beyond syntax coloring, and perhaps some validation.

From Wikipedia (search Visual Studio 2010):

"Visual Studio supports languages by means of language services, which allow the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists. Built-in languages include C/C++ (via Visual C++), VB.NET (via Visual Basic .NET), C# (via Visual C#), and F# (as of Visual Studio 2010[3]). Support for other languages such as M, Python, and Ruby  among others is available via language services installed separately. It also supports XML/XSLT, HTML/XHTML, JavaScript  and CSS. Language-specific versions of Visual Studio also exist which provide more limited language services to the user. These individual packages are called Microsoft Visual Basic, Visual J#, Visual C#, and Visual C++."

Most Python programmers will have their editors configured to automatically use four spaces for all .py files… Which could, at least initially, cause some minor headaches if they try to edit your source.

But apart from that (given that PEP 666 was rejected), it shouldn't cause any major trouble.

Of course, if you get serious about Python, it would be a good idea to follow PEP 8, as most Python code conforms to it… But, given that this is your first Python project, you've got bigger things to worry about than tabs VS spaces.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If all the world used tab-indented Python source, then everyone would be happy.
If all the world used 4-space indented Python source, then everyone would be happy.

Unhappiness arises when one tries to comingle tab-indented code with 4-space indented code.

The majority of Python code seems to be of the 4-space variety. If you ever wish to rip out some of this code and use it in your project, you will be saved from the minor annoyance of having to run it through a space-to-tab converter (like unexpand) if you stick with the PEP recommendation and use 4-spaces. 

You'll also cause less of a hassle for other developers (who follow the 4-space convention) who may wish to contribute to your project.

PS. Finding a good text editor is especially important when writing code in Python. It should allow you to press [TAB] and insert 4 spaces instead of 1 tab.
It should also allow you to be able to shift blocks of code by 1 level of indention to the left or right easily. Once you find the right editor (e.g. emacs or vim), working with the 4-space convention is a breeze.

Take a look at ctags, and e.g. vim.  In reality, "ctags" is a gross understatement, as you can generate an index of function and variable "tags" for almost any language.

I prefer to use PHPDesigner which does have a free edition.   What you appear to be asking about is called "code completition" which this editor does, along with the ability to right click a custom function and "Go to definition" or hit F1 to view the PHP Manual on that function.

May be Komodo edit ? It's close to Eclipse and Netbeans, but much more simpler. You can go to declaration of function or variable by a custom shortcut key or just CTRL + Click on the desired var/func.

I am trying to delete a user from a table. At first I was getting a timeout error but used the BeatnicClick() as described here:
Selenium IDE click() timeout
That solved the timeout error but I'm still getting the unexpected confirmation error. Here's part of the source code:

selenium.Click(&quot;ctl00_btnAddressBook&quot;);
selenium.WaitForPageToLoad(&quot;30000&quot;);
// selenium.BeatnicClick(&quot;ctl00_page_content_ExistingEmployees_ctl03_btnDeleteEmployee&quot;);

the selected item? =
selenium.GetConfirmation();

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
To handle the confirmation your code should look like

selenium.Click("ctl00_btnAddressBook"); 
selenium.WaitForPageToLoad("30000");
//the IDE code is to get around the IDE bug that it waits on click but it works in Se:RC
selenium.Click("ctl00_page_content_ExistingEmployees_ctl03_btnDeleteEmployee");
//handle the confirmation that appears after the click
string confirmMessage = selenium.GetConfirmation();
//Assert its the correct message
Assert.IsTrue(Regex.IsMatch(confirmMessage,"Are you sure you want to delete the selected item?"));


This should click on the delete element and then get the confirm and if you want it can assert its the correct message

Cheers,
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is really only a part1 answer, and I also suggest splitting this into 2 questions.

The key to using different IDEs is to make sure none of your build/code is IDE dependent. The most typical problem is that you check in the file containing the application's classpath (the .classpath file in eclipse for example). Instead, you should use an external dependency management system such as maven or ivy (ivy works if you use ant, but maven is both a build tool AND a dependency management system so I would recommend maven if you can). Any IDE worth its weight will have plugins to support ant, ivy and maven, so as long as the developers have the plugin, they just point to the appropriate ant or maven build files. Maven's website is http://maven.apache.org/ and Ivy's website is http://ant.apache.org/ivy/.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
part2:
for the second part, consider you can only gain about 4-5 seconds when switching from tomcat to jetty.
typically the startup of a servlet container takes 30-60 seconds. for a real speed improvement consider using JRebel. this allows you to see most changes in code instantly.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    

Use maven for the build (and everything else maven can do) and the IDE of choice for coding. Eclipse, IDEA, Netbeans, they all integrate with Maven.
AFAIK, there is still no server plugin in Netbeans for Jetty (see Issue 153500). But it should be possible to start Jetty in debug mode and to attach a remote debugger from Netbeans. Or you could use maven and the maven jetty plugin :)

Per the docs, all threads that are running Python code are stopped (by default, i.e., unless you're going out of the way to achieve a different effect).

You could stick a meta refresh in your head, but that will get ugly if you have a lot of php parse errors. You could put the page you want to test inside a frame and have some javascript refresh that frame every few seconds too. Then you could use any IDE and browser you want!

Zend will do this. But be forewarned that seeing a bunch of unfinished PHP code is very ugly. I'd suggest sticking with refreshing your browser.

If your project is connected to source control netbeans will show added lines with a green block at the beginning of the line, modified lines with a blue block, and deleted lines with a red arrow. It also marks these in the right margin/gutter. This is based off of compared to last commit, not last save however.

Title: What are the benefits of sticking with maven&#39;s default project directory structure?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Simply put, if you're using maven, should you treat the maven layout as the gold standard, or should you convert your layout to fit your tooling (WASD, myEclipse, RAD, etc.)?  

Realizing that maven is configurable and you can override the defaults in the Super POM, I'm attempting to determine if I should change the layout to support specific tools that are in house, or attempt to make those tools recognize the maven layout.  One thing to consider is the eventual integration of continuous build tools, as well as the different IDEs in play.  MyEclipse is currently being used, but word is that they are not going to renew licenses in 6 months.

The first question I asked regarding this sort of thing was a bit too specific and one-sided. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Maven is following the "Convention over Configuration" principle, which means that if you are following their conventions, then you do not need to redefine basic information, such as your project structure.

As far as I am concerned, I prefer to have the shortest pom.xml I can write, and I don't like to define the information like where to find the sources, the resources, and so on.

In addition to that, having the same structure for several projects is a evident benefit, especially if you have many applications to manage. It also helps new developers to understand the application if it follows some conventions...
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Like all "best practices," take it for what it's worth. As you point out, IDEs may have a particular project structure that they like - since most of your development is actually done in the IDE, that's how developers will actually think about problems.

If you standardize your shop around a standard project structure, you can always define that common structure in a company wide parent POM file.

The default project structure works, so don't waste time debating and deciding on a different project structure and then configuring maven to use it.

What are the service oriented architecture/webservices features available in IDE.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
A lot of IDE's simply let you enter the URL of a webservice and autogenerate clientside proxies at the click of a button. This means you also get intellisense for the web services - but this will normally be the case even if you generate the service in other ways.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you are talking about Java web services I suggest checking out the Eclipse web tools platform.  http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/

There are web services wizards that will generate a service top-down (from a wsdl file) bottom up (from a java bean) and can also generate client proxies from a WSDL.  There is also the "Web Services Explorer" which will let you test a web service without generating a client, and will also let you search and publish to UDDI registries.

Description: 
    
    
                    
In Visual Studio, there is a handy IDE shortcut for directly jumping to a file, i.e.

Ctrl + / (to select the Find combo-box)
Then type in &gt;open myclass.cs

This is much quicker than navigating through the Solution explorer to open the specified class.

However, if you try and open the code part of a form (not the designer part) in this way then Visual Studio simply returns:


  The operation could not be completed


... which means that I have to go through the Solution explorer to open them.

Is there any way to get this shortcut to work for forms, or is there some other shortcut?

Update: the problem seems to be with intellisense...

If I type &gt;open form1.cs then this works...

But if I type &gt;open form and then use the up and down keys to select from the intellisense, so that the combo reads &gt;open "Form1.cs (OpenShortcutTest)" then that operation will fail.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Remember the old class hierarchy posters that used to come w/Delphi?

I'm wanting a full class hierarchy browser for ALL my Delphi classes, including the custom ones I've built and installed on the palette, plus third-party components.  Ideally easily searchable by class name (including "whole word only" searches, so partial matches don't count).

I've only seen two things that come close: 

1) GExpets Class Browser - Works great, BUT doesn't automatically load ALL installed components / classes, which is what I want.  You have to import all the source units manually, as far as I can tell.... which can be quite a hassle.  It also doesn't allow "whole word only" searches, so sometimes searching for a class w/a common "sub name" takes forever.

2) Eagle / DevExpress CDK -  It loads the full class list automatically, and seems to work brilliantly, but it's only usable in D7 and prior, and it's not really focused on being a class browser per se, so much as an "inherit from" chooser.

Is there anything out there which does this already?  If not, how difficult would it be to write an app that, at bare minimum, builds a self-referencing class-name table, so I could at least throw it into a database / treeview component to easily view inheritance / ancestry, etc.?

Answer 1: 

    
    
I'm assuming you are running your code from within the IDE?

Your IDE is probably blocking while running your code. Look for a setting of some sort which might control that behaviour, otherwise I think your only choice would be to change IDE. (Or, run your code from outside the IDE)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Can you configure to run your script externally? I don't know about the specific IDEs, but I would try to spawn a different process for the debugged script and not run them under the IDE. If that doesn't help, then it is a problem of the IDEs.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The problem is your IDE not python. I don't use sleep that often, I've just tried it on the Eric IDE and you can use your IDE while your code is running, and sleeping. If can't set your IDE to do so and you need it then consider to change IDE or to run your code from console.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Personally, I think you should never ever ever execute code in the same loop as your IDE. Since most IDEs run a GUI mainloop, blocking this will cause complete freeze of the user interface. It is just asking for trouble, and I would take out bug reports against both those IDEs.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I suspect the problem the IDE is sitting in a loop waiting for the script to finish. 

That in itself is not a problem, provided any user generated messages are still processed while the IDE is in this loop. 

But what I suspect is going wrong in this case is the IDE is just running the loop without processing and messages and hence the user interface appears to be locked.

The IDE would need to be changed to either process GUI messages while in the loop or alternatively it needs to create a thread to run the the script. The thread would then run in the background and the GUI would remain responsive.

For example the Zeus for Windows IDE uses the background thread approach and it does not have this problem.

For the developer side of silverlight Visual Studio is all you need. For the designer side Expression Blend is what you will want.

Title: Spyder &ldquo;Git Command Line Tools&rdquo; Issue
Description: 
    
    
                    
Despite my trials to install the command line developer tools, it keeps providing me with an error message that says &quot;Can't install the software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server&quot;. I am on a new mac and am up to date on software.
Does anyone have suggestions on how to install these tools. Another fix would include how I could hide the message pop up from coming up everytime I do anything on the Spyder IDE. I also will include that I installed this IDE through Anaconda.
Thank you!

I was able to figure it out- on the current Mac OS system you must download XCode in order to fix the issue with command line tools within Spyder.
I'll leave the question and answer here in case it is useful for anyone else.
    
    
Title: Intellij does not show any errors in the syntax/does not give any suggestions
Description: 
    
    
                    
There's a couple of similar threads, but none seems to contain the answer to my issue.
My IDE does not show any error, does not give any suggestions, does not import anything. Example:
public static String createInversion(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; splitName) {
        splitName.removeIf(n -&gt; List.of(&quot;Lord&quot;, &quot;Lady&quot;).contains(n));
        ArrayList&lt;String&gt; reverted = List.newArrayList(splitName.stream()
        .collect(Collector.toCollection(LinkedList::new))
        .descendingIterator());
        return String.format(&quot;%s, %s&quot;, splitName.get(1), splitName.get(0));
        gyugyuihu
                dsfsdf
                rewfewr
    }

You can clearly see that the last three lines are random chains of letters without any context. My IDE does not highlight them, does not report any problems. I don't even know if I should use Collector or Collectors class, because I am given zero suggestions, it's like writing in a Word Document.
I am only given errors the moment I try to compile, but also just in the terminal. The code remains untouched by Intellij.
I do not have the Power Safe Mode on, SDK is set correctly, language level in Modules is set correctly, Settings -&gt; Build, Execution, Deployment -&gt; Java Compiler -&gt; Target Bytecode Version is set correctly, the main folder is marked as the Source Root.
I am out of ideas. Please help.

Have you tried to invalidate the caches? That usually clears up issues like this. It's easy to do too: From the main menu, select File | Invalidate Caches / Restart.

I'm not sure how it happened but a whole bunch of settings in my Eclipse java ide are messed up. I am assuming that this is also the reason why changing code while its running doesn't work anymore for me. When I run it in debug mode, change something and save it the changes are not happening in the program. I also dont get any warm messages if I do something that can't be changed while the code is running like adding a method or a field. Does anyone know what the problem is? I could probably reset all my settings but I also have some settings that I want to keep.

Two things to check:

Ensure that Build Automatically is selected under the Project menu; and
Make sure you're using Java version 1.4 or greater (Window menu &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Installed JREs.

Eclipse requires both of these conditions in order to perform hotswap debugging.
    
    
Title: Correct Cursor indentation on the new line after the semicolon in Javascript
Description: 
    
    
                    
I wish the cursor to be indented properly when I press enter after the semicolon. How can I achieve this in VS Code?

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can turn off wrappingIndent, or set it back to default same, and then ensure formatOnType is set to true:
&quot;[javascript]&quot;: {
    &quot;editor.wrappingIndent&quot;: &quot;same&quot;,
    &quot;editor.formatOnType&quot;: true
},

This will put all the new lines the same as the previous, as you type it will automatically indent, where applicable:
cy.visit('/admin/settings/categories/add')
  .get('[data-cy=name]').type('category')


As shown you would have to explicitly press 'Enter'; it doesn't work if you use shortcuts like CTRL + Enter.
One thing none of these wrapper-like settings will take into account is context; say you want to deep indent after the first .get(), arbitrarily for illustration:
cy.visit('/admin/settings/categories/add')
    .get('[data-cy=name]').type('category')
        .checkDb('Category', { name: 'Category 2' })
    .get('[data-cy=submit]').click();

The native formatter will automatically put it back in line with the other children.
This would ultimately need native extension/onEnter support

The structure should be valid even for html 4.01 . however i get the invalid location tag warning on eclipse for the nested/inner list.
Any idea why? And how to fix it without making eclipse just ignore that element

According to W3.org markup check &lt;ol&gt; does not allow to be within the &lt;ul&gt; element directly.
So you have to wrap your &lt;ol&gt; element inside a &lt;li&gt;, so do this like this:


&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;level one item one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;level two item one&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;level two item two&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;level one item two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;




If in any case, you wanted to hide the list style element from &lt;ol&gt; part you can do it by CSS styles like this:


ul &gt; li:nth-child(2) {
  list-style: none;
}
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;level one item one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;level two item one&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;level two item two&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;level one item two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Why do we have so many cells in jupyter notebook?
 To execute a piece of code, normally we have one large space like in eclipse, net beans or any other IDE.I want to know what all we can do with the cells in jupyter notebook?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The idea of Jupyter Notebook is that you can interleave code with explanatory text. This is why Jupyter offers two kinds of cells: code and markdown.

As an example, this is very useful for exploratory data analysis where you might want to write some prose in a markdown cell about where the dataset came from and what assumptions were made, then apply an algorithm in a code cell, plot the results in another code cell, and explain what it all means in another markdown cell. 

Another advantage of cells is that you can execute them individually. Some algorithms might take a very long time (think machine learning) and don't have to be executed every time you make a change to another part of the notebook (e.g. plotting).

Cells let you save states. Imagine you need to read a large dataset and perform some machine learning on it. You can use one cell to read the dataset–only once–and you can continue your data explorations down in the notebook. It saves a lot of time.

Just saying, it's not that bad since you can click on the method and it expands it.

Title: For Typescript intersection type (type C = A &amp; B), how to see resulting type signature instead of components in IDE hints?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Typescript, when inspecting types defined by intersection, I see a hint identical to original definition:

what is a quick / efficient way to do this? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't think there's any way to ask your IDE to do this automatically, but you can make a type function that calculates the type you're looking for.  From the answer to the question is duplicates, I would write Expand:

type Expand&lt;T&gt; = T extends infer U ? { [K in keyof U]: U[K] } : never;


which takes a type (or union of types) and walks through all of its properties, even if they come from multiple intersections, and packages it (or each union member) into a single object type.  Then you could either write Expand&lt;C&gt; or you could define C to be Expand&lt;A &amp; B&gt;:

type ExpandedC = Expand&lt;A &amp; B&gt;;
/*
type ExpandedC = {
    a: number;
    b: string;
    c: boolean;
    d: Date;
}
*/


which is what you wanted.  Okay, hope that helps; good luck!
