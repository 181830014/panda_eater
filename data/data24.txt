Title: Delphi-IDE: how to change the way class-completion works?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Class completion in Delphi is a big time-saver, but I haven't found a way to customize it.


I would like a getter and setter for a property to be grouped together instead of being thrown all over my unit; The interface part is generated properly, but the implementation section becomes a mess if you leave things up to the IDE. I want methods to be ordered like this by default:


  function TAaa.getAaa();
  
  procedure TAaa.setAaa();
  
  procedure TAaa.Baa();
  
  function TAaa.getCow();
  
  procedure TAaa.setCow();
  
  procedure TBbb.getAaa()

I want the implementation section to be in the same order as the interface; 
I want the body of a generated method to look something like this:


.

 procedure TMyClass.MyProc;
 begin
   { TODO -oWouter -cimplement autogenerated stuff : implement Procedure MyProc() }
   raise Exception.create('procedure TMyClass.MyProc() is not yet implemented');
 end;


Are there tools around to do this, or is it needed to dive into the opentools API to get something like this done?

Answer 1: 

    
    

  Question 1: I would like a getter and setter for a property to be grouped together.


The Modelmaker Code Explorer (MMX) has a sorting tool. The tool sorts class members in the interface and the implementation. The 4.05 version, I'm using, does not support your kind of sorting. However, the Modelmaker website contains a page that shows the most up to date sorting functionality and it appears they extended the sort functionality with many new options. Maybe you can group your getter/setter methods with their latest MMX tool.
Handy functionality:


Drag and Drop sorting in the MMX class explorer: you drag the method to the new location and modelmaker moves the code
Sorting hints: MMX will inform you if a method is not sorted according to your default sorting template



  Question 2: I want the implementation section to be in the same order as the interface.


The MMX sort functionality will do that. After you execute the sort, the interface and implementation will be in the same order.


  Question 3: I want the body of a generated method to look something like this...


The MMX [add new method] will automatically add a customizable code stub to your method's body. Parameters are supported in the code stub, but I have not seen the list of supported parameters. Here is a sample

procedure TForm1.NewMethod;

begin

// TODO TForm1.NewMethod default body inserted

end;

ModelMaker Code Explorer can do it. See http://www.modelmakertools.com/articles/sort-rearrange-code.html#sorting-scheme
    
    
Title: How do you handle different Java IDEs and svn?
Description: 
    
    
                    
How do you ensure, that you can checkout the code into Eclipse or NetBeans and work there with it?

Edit: If you not checking in ide-related files, you have to reconfigure buildpath, includes and all this stuff, each time you checkout the project. I don't know, if ant (especially an ant buildfile which is created/exported from eclipse) will work with an other ide seamlessly.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The smart ass answer is "by doing so" - unless you aren't working with multiple IDEs you don't know if you are really prepared for working with multiple IDEs. Honest. :)

I always have seen multiple platforms as more cumbersome, as they may use different encoding standards (e.g. Windows may default to ISO-8859-1, Linux to UTF-8) - for me encoding has caused way more issues than IDEs.

Some more pointers:


You might want to go with Maven (http://maven.apache.org), let it generate IDE specific files and never commit them to source control.
In order to be sure that you are generating the correct artefacts, you should have a dedicated server build your deliverables (e.g. cruisecontrol), either with the help of ant, maven or any other tool. These deliverables are the ones that are tested outside of development machines. Great way to make people aware that there is another world outside their own machine.
Prohibit any machine specific path to be contained in any IDE specific file found in source control. Always reference external libraries by logical path names, preferable containing their version (if you don't use maven)

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
We actually maintain a Netbeans and an Eclipse project for our code in SVN right now with no troubles at all.  The Netbeans files don't step on the Eclipse files.  We have our projects structured like this:

sample-project   
+ bin
+ launches  
+ lib  
+ logs
+ nbproject  
+ src  
  + java
.classpath
.project
build.xml


The biggest points seem to be:


Prohibit any absolute paths in the
project files for either IDE. 
Set the project files to output the
class files to the same directory.
svn:ignore the private
directory in the .nbproject
directory.
svn:ignore the directory used for
class file output from the IDEs and any other runtime generated directories like the logs directory above.
Have people using both consistently
so that differences get resolved
quickly.
Also maintain a build system
independent of the IDEs such as
cruisecontrol.
Use UTF-8 and correct any encoding issues
immediately.


We are developing on Fedora 9 32-bit and 64-bit, Vista, and WindowsXP and about half of the developers use one IDE or the other.  A few use both and switch back and forth regularly.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The best thing is probably to not commit any IDE related file (such as Eclipse's .project), that way everyone can checkout the project and do his thing as he wants. 

That being said, I guess most IDEs have their own config file scheme, so maybe you can commit it all without having any conflict, but it feels messy imo.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
For the most part I'd agree with seldaek, but I'm also inclined to say that you should at least give a file that says what the dependencies are, what Java version to use to compile, etc, and anything extra that a NetBeans/Eclipse developer might need to compile in their IDE.

We currently only use Eclipse and so we commit all the Eclipse .classpath .project files to svn which I think is the better solution because then everyone is able too reproduce errors and what-not easily instead of faffing about with IDE specifics.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I'm of the philosophy that the build should be done with a "lowest common denominator" approach.  What goes into source control is what is required to do the build.  While I develop exclusively in with Eclipse, my build is with ant at the command line.  

With respect to source control, I only check in files that are essential to the build from the command line.  No Eclipse files.  When I setup a new development machine (seems like twice a year), it takes a little effort to get Eclipse to import the project from an ant build file but nothing scary.  (In theory, this should work the same for other IDEs, no?  Surly they must be able to import from ant?)

I've also documented how to setup a bare minimum build environment.  
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I use maven, and check in just the pom &amp; source.
After checking out a project, I run mvn eclipse:eclipse
I tell svn to ignore the generated .project, etc.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Here's what i do:


Only maintain in source control your ant build script and associated classpath. Classpath could either be explicit in the ant script, a property file or managed by ivy.
write an ant target to generate the Eclipse .classpath file from the ant classpath
Netbeans will use your build script and classpath, just configure it to do so through a free form project.


This way you get IDE independent build scripts and happy developers :)

There's a blog on netbeans site on how to do 3. but i can't find it right now. I've put some notes on how to do the above on my site - link text (quick and ugly though, sorry)

Note that if you're using Ivy (a good idea) and eclipse you might be tempted to use the eclipse ivy plugin. I've used it and found it to be horribly buggy and unreliable. Better to use 2. above.
    
    
Title: Glide 4.7.1 listener not working for onResourceReady method and Exception listener
Description: 
    
    
                    
there!
I'm using glide to load images in my app. Previously I used Picasso and it worked but after migrating to the Glide (v4.7.1) I'm not able to use listener to get state of the resource. I attached code below please help me in this matter.

Glide.with(SlideImageActivity.this)
                    .load(Constant.arrayList.get(position)
                            .getImage())
                    .apply(new RequestOptions()
                            .placeholder(R.color.colorPrimary)
                            .dontAnimate().skipMemoryCache(true))
                    .listener(new RequestListener&lt;String, DrawableResource&gt;() {
                public boolean onException(Exception e, String model, Target&lt;DrawableResource&gt; target, boolean isFirstResource) {
                    spinner.setVisibility(View.GONE);
                    return false;
                }

                public boolean onResourceReady(DrawableResource resource, String model, Target&lt;DrawableResource&gt; target, boolean isFromMemoryCache, boolean isFirstResource) {
                    spinner.setVisibility(View.GONE);
                    return false;

            })
                    .into((ImageView) imageLayout.findViewById(R.id.image));


Error line shows under this 

new RequestListener&lt;String, DrawableResource&gt;()

If I try to build apk with this then following error shows


  error: wrong number of type arguments; required 1


IDE shows following


  Class anonymous class derived from RequestListener must be declard either abstract or implement methods.

Where is the Empty Project option within VS 2015? 

There is no longer a "General" or "Other templates" category &amp; is not visible under the basic list of C#/C++ options.

The "Empty Project" template (if it can be called that) is now located under:

Installed → Visual (C#/C++/etc) → Windows → Classic Desktop

Empty Project will show up as a standard item within the alphabetically ordered list.

This is assuming you installed basic language templates when installing VS - otherwise, just pick your language &amp; follow the prompts to install the necessary tools (+templates).

Title: Geany vs Eclipse for C development on large projects
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to find an IDE for C that will give me the same level of comfort I got used to from programming in Java. I heard good things about Geany (from related questions here on Stack Overflow), and am familiar with Eclipse from my work with Java, and I was wondering which would be better suited for Linux development (kernel space stuff). 

In particular I'm interested in an objective opinion of which one has a better (straightforward) integration with the terminal, and which one gets the closest to IDE features for OO languages like Java with the minimal amount of hassle. Any other relevant comparisons will be welcomed of course. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Use the Eclipse, Luke...

I supposed that I'd never give such advice, but Eclipse with CDT is a very good IDE, one of the most advanced. You should understand that Geany is only a text editor with some IDE features. And Eclipse is an IDE, yes - not so lightware like Geany, but it has lots of truly IDE features: refactoring, code analysis, error detection, and in-code hints. Also, it has easy integration with many popular profilers.

Simply try CDT - you'll like it.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The real question is: How much do you want your IDE to do for you? Eclipse will do much more than Geany, which can make you more productive, or can make it more fragile.

Eclipse will impose its own project structure, including putting metadata files in your directories. It will also require that it be able to successfully build your project(s) before many of its features will work, so you need to make sure that it can find all of your dependencies, etc. Basically, it may take more time &amp; effort to get started. However, it has a ton of features.

Geany is much less intrusive, much faster startup, with excellent text-editing abilities - perhaps better text-editing than Eclipse - but a more modest set of programming tools. It works well when you want your builds to be external, eg launching 'make' or Maven.

I use Eclipse for launching automated tests, and for interactions with SVN (Geany has a plugin for Version Control integration, but it's limited &amp; seems to be buggy). For most things, I prefer Geany.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I personally like Geany because it is so lightweight. But as Evgeny points out it is not a fully fledged IDE. Its built in terminal is a standard Linux shell (sh, no fancy bash here). If you don't need all the advanced features of Eclipse, Geany might be possible alternative, but if not, go with Eclipse.
    
    
Title: Creating a separate Folder in the same package&hellip; [ECLIPSE]
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is it possible in Eclipse to create a separate Folder in a package? When select "new --/pp/pp/pp/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
What you might want to do, if you aren't putting code in that folder, is remove the folder from the build path.  Right-click on the offending folder in eclipse and choose 'exclude from build path.'

Or, you may want a different effect:

Right click on your project and choose add new source folder.
Then in that folder, add the correct package folder structure.

You can have files in the same package located in different folders.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You need to exclude the folder from the source path
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
In a source folder, all 'new' folders will be considered a new package. It's part of the Java spec that makes all folders from a root to be part of the package structure.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
As others have said, this is standard java behaviour and shouldn't really be worked around.
You are probably better off creating another folder outside of the source folder.

However there is a way to do it in Eclipse, be warned that this might come back to haunt you if you later try to build outside Eclipse as other tools won't honour these settings.

You can exclude a folder from the source path by opening the project properties.

Selecting Java Build Path-strong/strongstrong/strongstrong/strongstrong/strongstrong/strong/pp/p/div
Answer 5: 

    
    
You want to create a new child package (bar) of the existing package. (com.foo)

Select new package and name it "com.foo.bar".  Eclipse will correctly place it under com.foo.

FYI: Folders under any "source" folder are shown as packages.  There is no physical difference except that they appear on the build path.  As shown elsewhere you can exclude them but it's easier to just not put them under /src/... to begin with.

I'm a c# developer but have a job that involves some jsp code. 
I've been using notepad++ which does a great job in highlighting but I'm missing the intellisense and find it difficult to find the methods I need.

What is a good jsp IDE for someone coming for C# that has intellisense?

Update

I tried eclipse and idea but both interfaces were really different and unfamiliar. So I ended up finishing it in notepad++. 

Update - Netbeans did the job

Thanks Kibbee. I had some more time and I tried netbeans and it works great with JSP. It was really easy to get it working.

You might want to check out Netbeans.  From what I remember for Java applications, it had pretty good intellisense support. Although I've never used it for JSP.

This wouldn't be an answer to your question, but don't expec VS-like functionality in the Java world. I'm not saying there are no good systems, I'm saying once you're used to VS, it is very hard to change your thinking about what an IDE should do. Just try out different IDEs and see what suits you best - it's always a personal choice.

Title: Debugging an exception in an empty catch block
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm debugging a production application that has a rash of empty catch blocks sigh:

try {*SOME CODE*}
catch{}


Is there a way of seeing what the exception is when the debugger hits the catch in the IDE?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In VS, if you look in the Locals area of your IDE while inside the catch block, you will have something to the effect of $EXCEPTION which will have all of the information for the exception that was just caught.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
In Visual Studio - Debug -
Answer 3: 

    
    
You can write

catch (Exception ex) { }


Then when an exception is thrown and caught here, you can inspect ex.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
No it is impossible, because that code block says "I don't care about the exception".  You could do a global find and replace with the following code to see the exception.

catch {}


with the following

catch (Exception exc) {
#IF DEBUG
    object o = exc;
#ENDIF
}


What this will do is keep your current do nothing catch for Production code, but when running in DEBUG it will allow you to set break points on object o.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
If you're using Visual Studio, there's the option to break whenever an exception is thrown, regardless of whether it's unhandled or not.  When the exception is thrown, the exception helper (maybe only VS 2005 and later) will tell you what kind of exception it is.

Hit Ctrl+Alt+E to bring up the exception options dialog and turn this on.

Can't you just add an Exception at that point and inspect it?

That doesn't work because the compiler ignores the Exception ex value if there is nothing using it.

Title: IntelliJ IDEA 12 not finding CodeIgniter classes, throwing errors
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using IntelliJ IDEA 12 to develop a PHP web application using the CodeIgniter framework. Due to the way CI instantiates objects and methods, IDEA thinks they don't exist when they're called:



As you can see, I get those annoying orange squigglies under every single CodeIgniter class/method I try to use.

Here's the code for the CI_Controller class, giving some insight into how they're creating the objects:

class CI_Controller {

    private static $instance;

    /**
     * Constructor
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        self::$instance =&amp; $this;

        // Assign all the class objects that were instantiated by the
        // bootstrap file (CodeIgniter.php) to local class variables
        // so that CI can run as one big super object.
        foreach (is_loaded() as $var =&gt; $class)
        {
            $this-&gt;$var =&amp; load_class($class);
        }

        $this-&gt;load =&amp; load_class('Loader', 'core');

        $this-&gt;load-&gt;initialize();

        log_message('debug', "Controller Class Initialized");
    }

    public static function &amp;get_instance()
    {
        return self::$instance;
    }
}


Is there any way I can get IntelliJ IDEA to either ignore these errors (but not other errors), or get it to find the objects on its own?

Note: I used to use PHPStorm, a PHP IDE build on the IntelliJ IDEA platform, and it did the same thing when it came to CodeIgniter.

I solved this by following this guide. It was meant for PHPStorm but works for IntelliJ IDEA as well (probably WebStorm too!). It was very simple, actually. A basic recap:


Saved the following PHP code in my project root. It's basically just a PHPDoc comment:



    &lt;?php  die('This file is not really here!');

    /**
     * ------------- DO NOT UPLOAD THIS FILE TO LIVE SERVER ---------------------
     *
     * Implements code completion for CodeIgniter in phpStorm
     * phpStorm indexes all class constructs, so if this file is in the project it will be loaded.
     * -------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Drop the following file into a CI project in phpStorm
     * You can put it in the project root and phpStorm will load it.
     * (If phpStorm doesn't load it, try closing the project and re-opening it)
     * 
     * Under system/core/
     * Right click on Controller.php and set Mark as Plain Text
     * Do the same for Model.php
     * -------------------------------------------------------------------
     * This way there is no editing of CI core files for this simple layer of code completion.

This is the solution that worked for me: https://github.com/Stunt/Codeigniter-autocomplete/

I'm using phpStorm but I imagine it would work with IDEA.

No need to mark files as plain text. Just drop the autocomplete.php file into the application/config folder and it works. I doubt the link at github will go bad but just in case here is the content of the file.

Answer 2: 

    
    
You can use Alt + - to open the context menu for the active tab. Once you have the context menu open, you can use the arrow keys to select e.g. Close All But Pinned.

Some options on the context menu have underscores for faster access, such as e.g. Close All But This, which can be accessed with a, so that the entire sequence for Close All But This becomes Alt + -, a.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Are you referring to "Close All but this"; right click on tab and you can get that. Don't know whats a pinned tab in VS.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
The only way to do it without changing standard keyboard mapping is to right-click on any tab and select "Close all but pinned".

PS. The pinned windows functionality is part of visual studio productivity power tools.

Title: Eclipse 2020-06 Javascript - Syntax Hightlighting not working
Description: 
    
    
                    
after updating my Eclipse IDE to the actual 2020-06 version the syntax highlighting for JavaScript does not work any more.
Is this a known/common problem and how can I fix this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
After spending most of a day futzing with it, including installing a new instance of Eclipse PDT, I found that I could fix it simply by adding *.js to the file associations and setting the default to &quot;Generic Text Editor&quot;.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Per the Eclipse Bugzilla Report:

Standalone JS Editor is not provided anymore.
To work with JavaScript/TypeScript projects users may install JS [1] or JEE [2] EPP packages, WildWebDeveloper [3] or other products.
[1] https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-06/r/eclipse-ide-web-and-javascript-developers
[2] https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-06/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-developers
[3] https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-wild-web-developer-html-css-javascript-typescript-nodejs-angular-json-yaml

Basically this means that the Eclipse JavaScript Development Tools (JSDT) is no longer supported.
It could just be me, but [1] seems to be a pretty stripped-down version of Eclipse. It doesn't even include Package Explorer, which baffles me. [2] is a bit better in my opinion, at least having Package Explorer. (I do love Package Explorer 😜) However, I'm not really interested in installing a new version of Eclipse when the way [1] and [2] implement JavaScript support is through [3] Wild Web Developer (&quot;WWD&quot;) anyway. (You don't have to follow that link for [3]; you can find it in the Eclipse Marketplace just fine. Also, you'll have to reopen any JavaScript files you have open for the update to work.)
I added WWD through the Eclipse Marketplace on my Windows x64 version of Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, 2020-06. I guess it works, but it sure doesn't integrate like JSDT did.
I'm not thrilled with WWD since the first thing I tried to do is comment a line in JavaScript using Ctrl+/ and it summons a dropdown of keyword and available function choices. Ctrl+. does the same thing, and feels more appropriate, so what's the deal? 🤨 Want to change the keyboard shortcuts? Too bad. There's nothing under the Keys preference that has anything to do with TextMate/WWD actions.
Want to change the syntax coloring? Better love what you're given. There is no Syntax Coloring section or anything like it. There's a TextMate set of preferences, but it seems like anything regarding Theme doesn't actually work. Is it because I use DevStyle and the Darkest Dark theme? Who knows.
There's only one WWD preference (XML), which does nothing but tell you &quot;See 'XML Catalogs' for XML catalogs preferences&quot;. Thanks? It's also version 0.10.0.etc, which feels like we're being forced to test it. Overall I'm pretty disappointed, especially since Eclipse just automatically upgraded itself from 2020-03 to 2020-06 and now I'm stuck with this. Boo to you on this move, Eclipse 😞
    
    
Title: why does the delphi ide increase the windows platform timer resolution?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have noticed that my battery life is significantly worse on my laptop whenever I have the delphi 2010 ide open. When I powercfg /energy trace, it shows (among other things) that bds.exe has requested a smaller timer resolution than the default of 15.6ms. 

Current Timer Resolution (100ns units) 10006 
Maximum Timer Period (100ns units) 156250 


Requested Period 10000 
Requesting Process ID 7996 
Requesting Process Path \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\RAD Studio\7.0\bin\bds.exe 


Does delphi have a good reason to alter the platform timer resolution? Also do the latest versions of the ide have the same behavior?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The IDE uses a very old version of VirtualTrees.pas for the ProjectManager, StructureView and Log-Window. This version calls timeBeginPeriod in its InitializeGlobalStructures function and sets the timer resolution to the minimum (1). It is reset in the unit's finalization block.

VirtualTrees changed this behavior with this commit:

2013-09-20 21:40:21: No longer changing timer resolution globally (#365)


But the IDE still uses a very old version that isn't even using UnicodeString but WideString. So it wasn't updated since Delphi 2007.
    
    
Title: Setting up Cloud9 IDE to compile and run Java?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have tried posting this request in Cloud9's forums, but since it never posts, I am hoping someone here could give me a hand. (The forum keeps saying my question is being submitted for review, but then never shows up).

I can't get Java code to compile and run. I've Googled the issue and read other posts in their limited forums, but I can't get it to compile and run a simple Hello World! program. My .java filename matches the class and the code is fine.

I have tried putting my .java files in the following directories:

test/java/

test/src/


I just get this:

bash: src/HelloWorld.java: No such file or directory


I tried this: http://www.programmingforliving.com/2014/09/java-coding-with-cloud9-ide.html

But I just get:

Running HelloWorld.java                                                                                                                                          

Error: Could not find or load main class HelloWorld  


Any suggestions? Given I'm essentially a Java noob I am hoping the solution is fairly simple. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Without you pasting in your code it's tough to tell but make sure your class and filename are both titled HelloWorld. Make sure your src folder is in your main workspace folder so your file should be at /home/ubuntu/workspace/src/HelloWorld.java.

Also, this documentation looks pretty similar to the blog you referenced but still worth a look https://docs.c9.io/docs/custom-runners.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I think that Codenvy is much better in java than Cloud9. It provides easy build &amp; run configuration, code completion, project sharing with permissions or factory (creates clone of your project with one click in minutes).
Take a look at official java spring factory. This link opens temporary(personal) java project ready to code, build &amp; run. 
Also Codenvy has project wizard that has a lot of project types including java console app (uses maven).
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Ok, decided to screw around with it and figured it out... (then saw that Brady Dowling had posted a link that explained in better detail what needed to be changed).

At any rate, I noticed a few things in Cloud9.


Even after making the changes and saving, it would still not compile correctly. I had to close my session of C9 and go back in. Then it would work.
After compiling, and trying to run the program, it wasn't automatically picking the Java runner I made. So if you are running into issues, make sure the Java (or whatever you decided to name it) runner is selected in the console.
You have to compile and run separately. Kind of annoying, but at least it works. Unlike C/C++ in C9, it won't compile and run by simply hitting 'Run'. If you do, it creates an error saying the .class doesn't exist. Simple as pressing F7 to build, then F5 to run.


Anyway, I took screenshots of what I had to change to get it working. Essentially, just the directories it looks for the .java file in (the right arrows) and the directory it looks for/compiles the .class file to (the left arrows). Since I was putting the .java and .class in the same directory (java), I just changed both to 'java'. In the links Brady and myself posted, they used .bin (for .class) and src for (.java).

1st picture is the Builder file (I called it javac) and the 2nd picture is the Runner file (I called it Java).




Anyway, I hope this helps someone out. I am really liking C9 and it perfectly suits my novice needs at the moment. I like the ability to dabble in multiple languages to see what I like without having to switch applications. The real-time live preview HTML/CSS like Brackets is another huge plus for me. 

Regards
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
For what I understand, C9 workspaces don't come with jdk installed. But I always use these commands:


sudo apt-get update


(wait a while for it to finish processing. Then)


sudo apt-get install default-jdk


(Then It will ask you for some permission. Type "Y")

And then it compiles and runs normally using the terminal.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Sometimes you will also need to install a package to get javac.

Example: 

sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
The java command works right of the box. You may java -version to see that it is Ubuntu running. You can also locate the java binary and see that it is amd64. That is all you need to know to download jdk manually from Oracle.com, like 

wget --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie"  http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u92-b14/jdk-8u92-linux-i586.tar.gz

tar xf jdk-8u92-linux-i586.tar.gz


and voila, jdk-1.8.0_92/bin/java(c) can be executed! It allows you to compile java files.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Yes, I know there is MonoDevelop.  But what if I want to use Textmate instead?

So my question here is aimed at the .Net developer who has developed some C# applications using Textmate.  I'm curious as to what their process/workflow is with this setup.


What is the best C# bundle out there for syntax/language grammar?
How do you build your project? (easy to build app for 2.0, 3.0, and/or 3.5 framework?)
Can you easily start a C# application in Visual Studio, and then continue to use TextMate in it's place?


Are there too many pitfalls here in thinking I could do this, and am I just taking crazy pills?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
To be honest I still do my actual C# building through a Virtual Machine running Windows, but I edit anything that I can through Textmate.
I use the ASP.Net VB.Net tmbundle and I actually just discovered a C# tmbundle.

I am planning on switching to building in MonoDevelop if I can, but right now I work with teams that only use Windows so to be safe I'm still stuck building in Visual Studio.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I know this is an old question, but I found it along the way when trying to find a C# bundle for TextMate. 

The C# bundle has moved from the macromoates svn repos into github at https://github.com/wintermi/csharp-tmbundle.

Hopefully this helps other people looking for the bundle.

Reinstall from scratch is usually the best way to go. Your netbeans installation is probably slowed down by all the plugins, settings, files, cache, old files, and other stuff that its trying to load at startup. Backup your .netbeans profile folder, delete the old one, download a new netbeans installation (netbeans itself might of collected old files), and restore your settings.

If that doesn't speed things up, then really the only thing you can do is upgrade the computer

If your problem has seemingly got worse over time you can delete the .netbeans folder that is placed in your user home directory, this should speed things up in that case.

As a precursor to deleting the .netbeans folder i would run netbeans with a custom home directory 


  netbeans.exe --userdir
  c:\temp\myTestHome\


And see if that fixes the problem... If it does then delete your .netbeans folder, but be warned that it will behave as a new installation after that - ie no settings/plugins that you defined will be present anymore.

Are there any IDE's for developing HLSL code?  The three key features I want are:
1) syntax highlighting
2) auto-complete
3) interaction debugging

Visual Studio doesn't do any of these things, and it doesn't seem that RenderMonkey or FX Composer do either.

Is there some IDE that I'm not aware of, or does one of these three IDE's actually support these features and I'm too clueless to figure out how to use them properly?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Have you actually tried ATI's RenderMoney or NVidia's FX Composer?

Both actually provide syntax highlighting. Futher more, NVidia's Cg toolkits actually allows you to enable syntaxhightling in Visual Studio with some custom setting.

As for auto-completion, I don't think it's much needed as compare to our normal programming. It's because you won't be writing a very long code for your shader programming. Shader is quite critical in that it is run on every frame generated, and every instruction require 1 to a few clock cycle to execute, thus there's always a physical limit to how long you can afford to write.

Interactive debugging is currently the limitation of GPU hardware. To actually do that, the GPU has to be emulated with our CPU, which is quite impossible considering that the REF (software rendering) device can never cop up with even obsolete GPU, what more to say about emulating shader.

If you press "Enter" it just pastes in the autocomplete, if you press "Tab" it replaces it. I would guess you are always pressing "Tab", so try "Enter" and see if you like how that works.

Full Documentation from JetBrains

Here's the TLDR;


Use Enter to insert the selected string at the insertion point.
Use Tab to replace the string next to the caret with the selected one.
Use Ctrl+Shift+Enter to make the current code construct syntactically correct (balance parentheses, add missing braces and semicolons, etc.)

Delphi stores breakpoints in the [Breakpoints] section of your project's .dsk file. Make sure that file is writable, and make sure your source-control system isn't accidentally clobbering it.

Title: IDE / setup for package development with C++ code integrated
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to get a grip on C++/Rcpp as an extension to R for heavy computational tasks. Ultimately, these C++ libs should be integrated in a package, and therefor I'm looking for a setup / combination of tools / IDE that I would need to work easily. I know much is taste dependent, but still it would be nice to know my options before choosing.

So : when you develop R packages with C++ libs, what is the setup you work with?


do you use the same editor / IDE for R and C++ and which one (or which ones) ?
are there extra tools (apart from Rtools) that are important to get ?
are there tweaks in the general setup that are important to know or speed up the process considerably?


Sorry if this question has been asked before. I found a list of all editors for R, but nothing specifically directed towards developing of packages including C++ code. Any hints or tips are really appreciated.

Edit : platform is Windows, but I can move to Linux without problems (dual boot, only thing keeping me from using ubuntu is the lack of a decent driver for my old card/old screen combination)

Answer 2: 

    
    
I'm of course fully in favour of more Rcpp work :)  

As for your questions, and in order:


same editor (Emacs) which makes for nice consistency on either platform I use (mostly Linux, occassionally Windows); for the record I have also spoke out in favour of the qtcreator IDE which is pretty nice on Linux and Windows (but doesn't do R).
no, on Linux it all comes ready made (and yes, on Windows you do need Rtools) ...
not really -- you probably already know about inline which is good for testing R/C++ code snippets.


Edit: So in a way, this is really no different from normal R / C / C++ / Fortran development.  And in that case I usually refer to R FAQ Section 6 which is devoted entirely to R and Emacs :)
With that said, setting Emacs up for C++ work is not obvious and there are a number of questions and posts here.  I do not use any particular class browser but there are some, as well as approaches to auto-completion of types etc.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You will want an editor that can handle multiple languages, R, C+, maybe Makefiles, etc.  Since you mention Rtools it sounds like you are on Windows.  I would suggest Notepad++ it handles R, C++, and a whole lot of other languages.  Plus you can setup custom command through NppExec to build the package more easily.  I have developed a few packages that make heavy use of C/C++ using Notepad++.

I want to write a library for my Arduino(header and class files), but I don't know what tools to use for this job and how to test and debug them.

The Arduino IDE just helps in writing plain programs for direct bootloading, not full project management thing (correct me if I am wrong and guide appropriately with relevant references).

Please help.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The compiler supports the #include directive, you can write your library, then #include it. This is expanded on in this tutorial about writing libraries for the Arduino.

For testing you can use ArduinoUnit. This itself is a library - so take a look at the source code (in the download) if you need inspiration.

Just take any Arduino library and look inside. You'll find all what it needs to make one – the class, public and private variables and methods, maybe getters, setters...

Issue:
The Eclipse marketplace client has gone missing from the drop down help menu in Eclipse:

Although, the plugin is installed and up to date. I can see this in the installed software section:

I've tried reinstalling the plugin and running -clean but no change, any ideas?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It is possible for the plugin to have class loading issues that were not detected by p2 when it installed it. 

In this case you will see the plugin as installed because it is present in the p2 metadata of your Eclipse. However the OSGi framework might not be able to resolve the dependencies of the plugin/bundle at runtime. Such discrepancies happen because the p2 engine and the OSGi framework use different ways to resolve dependencies. The p2 engine is less accurate in the presence of multiple versions and can allow you to install plugins that can not run. It is even possible to break existing plugins by installing something completely unrelated that brings additional versions of third party libraries like logging. Typically OSGi detects that the plugin/bundle needs to load two versions of the same java package. This versioning conflict is called a "uses constraint violation".

Open the 'Error log view' from Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Error log. Look for logs with "FrameworkEvent ERROR" in the title related to the "org.eclipse.epp.mpc.*" plugins.

Here is an example of a versioning conflict caused by the need for org.eclipse.epp.mpc.ui to load simultaneously two versions of the org.apache.commons.logging package. I was able to resolve this by deleting the jcl.over.slf4j jar from the "plugins" directory. This leaves Eclipse/p2 thinking the deleted jar is still installed since p2 has a record about it in it's metadata. In reality we only load at runtime one version of the package - the one exported by the org.apache.commons.logging plugin.

Title: Python: how to batch rename mixed case to lower case with underscores
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've written a fair bit of my first significant Python script. I just finished reading PEP 8, and I learned that lower_case_with_underscores is preferred for instance variable names. I've been using mixedCase for variable names throughout, and I'd like my code to be make more Pythonic by changing those to lower_case_with_underscores if that's how we do things around here.

I could probably write some script that searches for mixedCase and tries to smartly replace it, but before I potentially reinvent the wheel, my question is whether a solution for that already exists, either within a Python-savvy editor or as a standalone application; or whether there's another approach that would accomplish the task of converting all mixedCase variable names to lower_case_with_underscores. I have searched a fair bit for a solution but didn't turn up anything. Any technique that specifically would yield this result would be appreciated.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I was able to accomplish what I wanted using GNU sed:

sed -i -e :loop -re 's/(^|[^A-Za-z_])([a-z0-9_]+)([A-Z])([A-Za-z0-9_]*)'\
'([^A-Za-z0-9_]|$)/\1\2_\l\3\4\5/' -e 't loop' myFile.py


It finds every instance of mixedCase -- but not CapitalWords, so class names are left intact -- and replaces it with lower_case_with_underscores; e.g. myVariable becomes my_variable, but MyClass remains MyClass.

(On an unrelated note, now that I've done it, I think I prefer the appearance of mixedCase over lower_case_with_underscores. The appearance of so many underscores all over my code is weird. But I'll do things the Python Way and see if I get used to it, particularly if I intend for my code to be seen or worked with by others; or maybe I'll do it the way I like and I've now got a simple way of converting it to the PEP 8 way if I intend to make the code public.)

That is not true. A project in IDEA is not like a workspace. 
Think about this: you set the minSDK, target and maxSDK to the project, it has some configuration for the project. But the workspace dont have any configuration.

The project is just a project, but can have multiple packages like in eclipse. That's all.

Yes you can open Multiple Projects in a single Environment

It isn't possible, android studio is based on intelij and intelij open one and only one project or multi-module project.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Yes.

According to the Eclipse to Intellij FAQ: 
- Projects in intellij = workspaces in eclipse.
- Modules in intellij = projects in eclipse.

There seems to be somethings wrong with the new module wizards in Android Studio; at least I find them creating different types of projects, depending on what options I use (export/import creates different projects than if you build them from scratch). Migrating multiple projects to this currently looks as if it is going to be a serious pain.
    
    
Title: Refactoring - How to prevent refactorings tab showing?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Delphi XE, I use the rename variable refactoring (Ctrl+Shift+E) a lot of the time to make my code easier to understand by giving more meaningful variable names, for example:



That is all good but I have one slight issue regarding workspace when I use this. I like to keep the code messages etc pinned to the bottom, they only appear when I hover my mouse over them - this is my preference to allow more space for the editor.

Now, when I use the rename variable refactoring, the dialog has the checkbox: View references before refactoring as shown from the image above. I have this unchecked as I generally don't need to oversee what is been changed etc, if needs be I just undo it.

Here is my issue, with that unchecked I would of hoped for the refactoring to of performed silently, but no I still get the refactorings window showing up underneath:



It might not be considered a major issue but every time I have to manually close the refactorings window is just wasting time and is becoming a nuisance.

I noticed if you click on the refactorings tab in the editor there is an option to hide, but this is not permanent as it will come back the next time you refactor anyway.

Is there an option I may have missed somewhere to prevent the refactorings window from displaying in the code editor?

jEdit + Buildr + JavaRebel (for the shell) == an excellent workflow.  I don't get the compile-on-save behavior offered by the Scala Plugin, but I can live without that.  Compiling Scala on save is tricky anyway due to the complexity of the type system.

I am amazed no one has pointed this out yet.

Windows includes a Javascript engine that can be used from the command line.  

All versions of Windows, since Windows 98, have included something called "The Windows Script Host". It's a windows-standard way to support script "engines".  Since the first release, WSH supports JScript, Microsoft's version of Javascript. Among other things, this means that, from a windows command line, you can just invoke the name of any *.js file, and it will run in the JScript engine. (via either wscript.exe or cscript.exe)


  You can see this question:  What is the ProgId or CLSID for IE9&#39;s Javascript engine (code-named &quot;Chakra&quot;) to learn how to invoke the higher-performance IE9 Javascript engine from cscript.exe. 


I use cscript.exe to run jslint from within emacs, on any .js module I'm editing.  (via flymake-for-js)  Lots of people use .js modules to do system maintenance or administration.

On top of that, you can take a look at jslib http://code.google.com/p/jslibs/ which uses spidermonkey, the core of javascript engine in firefox.

Java 6 has support for executing JavaScript within Java code. You can load any arbitrary JS file and execute (eval) it. 

Here's a simple code example for the same:

Might as well throw Google's V8 engine into the ring

Please see JasonMP85's answer for a few more options as well.

There are tons of independent, js engines, adding to previous post


JSDB, http://www.jsdb.org/
Narwhaljs, http://narwhaljs.org/


There are tons of standalone JS engines and framework built on top of them (Node.js, ringojs, etc.)

Well, all you need is to choose based on what you need.
    
    
Title: A feature rich JavaScript IDE environment?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm currently using Visual Studio 2008 to edit .js files with, and it has decent support but I want more... 

I like the VS syntax highlighting and auto-indentation features but additionally would like advanced features like: contextual info and help, collapsible JavaScript blocks, implicit symbol understanding for searching, refactoring and that kind of thing; also warnings and errors for the js code.

Suggestions?

Edit: ooops... for the Windows platform. I see some Eclipse answers already and that's fine as I'll install Eclipse on Windows.

Purpose: I want the tool to be feature rich to aid my understanding of what's happening because JavaScript can get quite obtuse when jQuery is being used. Actually, it can be quite obtuse to understand regardless. Plus the additional (non-jQuery) branching for different browsers and tweaks. It can take a long time to wade through.
