In Eclipse there is a shortcut key CRTL+Q will take me to the last modified location. 

Does Delphi also has such a shortcut key? Thanks in advance.
    

        
Title: how to make the custom repositories maven in Android studio appear in IDE project structure dependencies
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a private maven server in google cloud.
in the main gradle I add the maven reference.

allprojects {
    repositories {
       ...
       ...
        maven {
            credentials {
                username 'xxxx'
                password 'xxxx'
            }
            url "https://xxxxx-xxxxx-maven.appspot.com"
        }
    }
}


If I add the reference directly to the gradle of the app, it works perfectly.

compile'xxx.xxxx.xxxx:example:1.0'
OR
implementation 'xxx.xxxx.xxxx:example:1.0'


The problem is that the number of references is increasing, and if I try to use the option "Project Structure / Dependencies" it does not show me results when searching.



How do I get my own private references to appear to me, to somehow take my credentials and show them?

thanks

Title: Is there a way to select multiple cursors between different groups in VSCode?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In VS Code we can split the screen into different groups. Is there a way to select multiple cursors between these groups? This would be useful to do scrolling between different files, for example
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
No, cursors can only be active in a single editor. I believe that https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/38893 tracks this feature request
    
    
Title: Python: cross referencing files from another project without hard directory reference
Description: 
    
    
                    
I mostly work on Java/c# before and like the feature these IDEs provide to import the whole project into a workspace tree without messing up all the references (Underlying linker seems to handle them). Is there anything equivalent in python?

I now works on a few different projects in python and realized that referencing each other becomes a nightmare. Either I have to write the absolute path when I do import or I have to copy files / make symlinks (not easily portable to Windows hence platform dependent).

I definitely know symlinking / hard directory links (put the whole directory in import) works but when I have to move files around / switch OS they all break.

Does such thing exist in the Python world? What's the intended way when I have to modularize things into projects and cross-reference something?

(I have read Python: Referencing another project but it doesn't help, any method there brokes when modules are moved to a different place. Really want an automatic solution.)

I am trying to tweak my IDE settings for VS2017 Community Mac. I have download a theme and everything looks good except for the fact that the line numbers &amp; column they are in are white (see below). Is there a way to change this? 


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You did not specify what type of theme you are using (.json, .vssettings, textmate(?)), so add/update your theme with following and adjust the colors to your preference:

.vssettings:

&lt;Item Name="Line Number" Foreground="0x00494E3F" Background="0x00343129" BoldFont="No"/&gt;


.json:

{"name": "Line Numbers", "fore":"#BDBDBD", "back":"#2A2A25" },


textmate (not really sure this is even supported any more):

&lt;Style name="linenumber" color="#AAAAAA" bgColor="#FDFDFD" /&gt;

I work under Visual Studio 2015 community edition.

Recently I moved the solution to another directory.
It works as before, but now, I have a warning in in the top position of every source code tap: it is in German, but translated it says: 

 The directory specified in the option -current directory is no

But how can I change the current directory? I found no place where to do that...


    

        
Title: Dynamically publishing to multiple MQTT topics with Ardrino Sketch
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've got all the the code working reading the temperatures and humidity values but I' having great difficulties trying to get it to compile and publish correctly. i have two arrays declared where the readings are stored. - Working. I have successfully connected to my MQTT broker - working. I can print to the console - working. Bu for the life of me, I cannot seem to get the code correct for publishing the data using #include  and #include . This is the publishing loop where I print the data to the console and wish to use this to publish to my 8 different MQTT Topics.

// MQTT Setup MQTT: ID, server IP, port, username and password
#include &lt;SPI.h&gt;
#include &lt;Ethernet.h&gt;
#include &lt;PubSubClient.h&gt;
#include &lt;ArduinoJson.h&gt;

float pubtemp;

//This is the array for the topics
String station[8] ={

//Initialize the Temperature and Humidity Values
int Ch[8][2] = {{2120,00},{2120,00},{2120,00},{2120,00},{2120,00},{2120,00},
{2120,00},{2120,00}};
//This is the array for the low battery flag on the sensors
int Batt[8] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}; // added 2/2/18 for battery status


here is the code that does the publishing

if (now - lastSampleTime &gt;= fiveMinutes)
 {
lastSampleTime += fiveMinutes;
 // Serial.print (lastSampleTime);
 // Serial.println("***");
if (!client.connected()) {
 reconnect();

   JsonObject&amp; payload = jsonBuffer.createObject();
   payload["temperature"] = pubtemp;
   payload["humidity"] = Ch[m][1];

   /This formats the json for the data and is working
   sPayload = "";
   payload.printTo(sPayload);
   cPayload = &amp;sPayload[0u];
   Serial.println (cPayload);    

   This is where I'm having difficulties with the variable topics
   sTopic="";

I am coming from IntelliJ IDEA background and used the "Introduce local variable" feature a lot by clicking Alt+Enter on a non-declared-yet identifier.

Now when I am using PyCharm I can't find that functionality in Alt+Enter menu. How can I enable this feature in in PyCharm?

I know that Python isn't a strictly-typed language but the initial value of the variable can be i.e. None.
