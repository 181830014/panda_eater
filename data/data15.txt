Title: Apple iOS IDE for linux?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am interested in getting to know whether there is an IDE to develop for Apple iOS? I am currently learning Objective-C, but I don't have a Macbook or something like that.

So actually I am looking for an "all around" IDE, including:


Objective-C compiler
Objective-C debugger
Possibilities to test developed apps (like an iPhone emulator)


What else would I need to develop iPhone apps on Ubuntu (if that's possible)?

Thank you for any suggestions.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
What you are asking for is neigh impossible. The only solution I could think of to develop on Linux would be to use GCC or Clang to compile Objective-C. There are no Apple Frameworks or simulators, save GnuStep, and that isn't 100% compatible.

There are a few problems. 


The iOS SDK libraries don't exist for Linux. 
The simulator does not exist for Linux. 
How do you plan to sign your app from Linux?


You could technically use a VM, but that is against the Mac OS X EULA. Another sketchy option is to compile against GNUStep and test on a jailbroken device. 

Honestly, your best bet is to break the bank and get a Mac (Mini or Air, now that the MacBook is discontinued. That said, you might consider spending a bit more on a larger screen. It's really hard to write code on just 11 inches of screen.) A few moths of developing may make back your initial investment. 

Good luck!

While probably not producing native looking apps, there are a couple cross-platform multimedia  tool-stacks, like the Kivy Project - which supports packaging for iOS - http://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-ios.html - This project does use Python as the programming language, not objective C.

Take a look here for info on this. Basically, running a virtual machine with an OSX image is likely to be the best approach if you'd like to distribute your app through the Apple store.
    
    
Title: Free alternative to MPLAB (PIC development)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I started using MPLAB recently, but for someone that works with Eclipse and VS the IDE it's very limited. Do you know any free IDE or how to configure Ecplise or Netbeans to PIC development?

Thanks all
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The underlying toolchain (compiler/linker etc.) can be used from any environment including Eclipse and Visual Studio, though Eclipse is probably the more flexible in this respect.  

MPLAB has a feature to export a project as a makefile that can be used with GNU make, although you may rather generate your own makefile, or use the project management provided by Eclipse.  In Visual Studio, create a Makefile Project, despite its name, you can specify any build command line, so invoke a batch file or makefile as necessary. Eclipse can use makefile projects also.

In Visual Studio, add all your project and compiler Include paths to teh project manually to get all the Intellisense navigation features to work.

There is a version of MPLAB X that is based on Netbeans.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    

  Do you know any free IDE or how to configure Ecplise or Netbeans to PIC development?


No, but I'd write a US$100 check of my own money in a heartbeat, if Eclipse were available for PICs. The poor quality of MPLAB has been my one and only reason why I don't use Microchip processors anymore. TI's Code Composer is Eclipse-based and it is hugely easier to use and much more reliable than MPLAB.

You could run Eclipse CDT and presumably configure it to use the Microchip compiler (caveat: I've never done this myself). But you wouldn't get any debugging capability, which is 90%+ of the value of an IDE.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Some Options:

Piklab (this is a fork of pikdev and better IMO, has a windows version)

Pikdev

You'll probably need gputils which is a set of open source PIC utilities for various things and integrate into the above IDEs.

There is also PIC C builder for Eclipse that would let you build with the C30 compiler, don't think it supports C18 but maybe.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
You should definitely switch to MPLAB X. Be warned though that it is a beta release.

Nonetheless it promises to rid us of both windows and the very buggy MPLAB 8.x (I'm not sure about the latter, though). It is a welcome step. I was sifting through their "Getting Started With MPLAB X" slides a little while earlier. In one of the slide it says that they chose NetBeans based IDE over an Eclipse based one because "NetBeans is acknowledged by many as
being: More advanced, Less bloated, Faster and More intuitive". I have worked with both of these and I think Eclipse is far superior in about every arena.

MonoDevelop has now released a installer for Windows. You no longer need to build it from source. It is available from the MonoDevelop website

However on windows it runs on the .NET Framework, not Mono - it uses the .NET debugger instead of the Mono one.

Answer 1: 

    
    
So I'm a little late to the game here...4 years late, but this solution should work.

So this issue is arising because another program has that file open and could change its contents at any time (theoretically) and so your Operating System won't let you try to make changes too. This is typical to all OS's. You wouldn't want multiple copies of the same file open with different programs, because then you wouldn't really know which copy is the file of truth, or how to merge the changes properly, etc. Essentially you need to stop the program that is currently using that file so that you can read/write to it.

Anyways. If anyone looking for an answer here is using a Linux/Unix based OS, refer to this post.

If you're running into this issue on a Mac, the post above may work for you also since OSX is Unix based.

SOLUTION

If you're on Windows 10 (might work for older versions), you can just go to the file location in the file explorer, and try to move it to another folder. Don't try to delete it because it might actually work, but moving it should bring up a popup saying "File In Use" looking like this:



So the popup here says "the file is open in Java(TM) Platform SE Binary". That's your ticket.

Now go into Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + ESC in Windows), and find and select the program has the file open, and click 'End Task'. Now you should be free to use/alter/run the file that you couldn't before.

Also, in the end restarting your computer will do the same thing generally. But this is faster IMO.

Hope this helps some people. Cheers.

For me, copying the contents of the file into a new file, and then deleting the original file, works to resolve these kinds of errors. After you've deleted the file, create a new one with the same name, and paste back in the content.

If the file is auto-generated (for example, Typescript output) then just deleting the file works.

TO find out which process is locking this file/folder under Windows 10:

Use resmon.exe included in Windows (exec resmon.exe from the start menu):


Open Resource Monitor, which can be found By searching for Resource Monitor or resmon.exe in the start menu, or As a button on the Performance tab in your Task Manager
Go to the CPU tab
Use the search field in the Associated Handles section See blue arrow in screen shot below When you've found the handle, you can identify the process by looking at the Image and/or PID column.
You can then try to close the application as you normally would, or, if that's not possible, just right-click the handle and kill the process directly from there. Easy peasy!

Title: Move default config folder of eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
When Eclipse first start, it creates some config files and folders on my hard drive (contains information about work-space ...etc...). I don't like the position it creates config files because config files are all put in my C:\Users\Long folder and that's ugly. I want to put all those config files somewhere else (C:\Eclipse\ for example). This happens in Linux too.

Do you know how to put those files in somewhere else?

Just add the following to your eclipse.ini file (found at the root eclipse installation folder):

-Dosgi.configuration.area=file:/C:/Workspace/.eclipse 

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
To change the default .eclipse folder location, go to ${eclipse.home}, open your eclipse.ini with a text editor and insert there one line more:

-Dosgi.configuration.area=/path_to_new_folder_location/.eclipse/
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Eclipse has some command line arguments you can use. One of those arguments is the flag -data which tells Eclipse where the workspace of Eclipse should be located.

So when I create a new workspace, I normally create a shortcut under Windows (or script file under Linux) with the following contents:

eclipse.exe -vm &lt;JDK&gt;\bin\javaw.exe" -data ws -nl en


This defines which JDK should be used, that the workspace is located under ws and that the english locale should be used.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
As other said, adding the property -Dosgi.configuration.area in the eclipse.ini file does the trick. 

But in my opinion it would be better to rely on the user.home variable and set the destination like for the other variables.

Example with -Dosgi.instance.area.default: 

-Dosgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/eclipse-workspace


In my case I just wanted another destination than the default @user.home/.eclipse which was used by the Eclipse Mars I still uses for old project and I defined: 

-Dosgi.configuration.area=@user.home/.eclipse-oygen-3


to have a specific destination for Eclipse Oxygen 3 installation.

Note that syntax works for both Windows and Linux (I did not tested on OSX, but I guess it should). 
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
IMHO parameter -configuration does the trick. It must point to a subdirectory named "config". Eclipse will fill this and the upper directory itself with files, e.g. for a JBoss server installation.

If you have more than one eclipse installation, then you should use a different directory for each eclipse installation. 

Example how to keep everything in defined places:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\eclipse\eclipse48jee\eclipse.exe" -nl en_US -vm "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_212\bin" -configuration C:\EclipseData\eclipse48jee\config -data C:\Workspaces\SomeProject
    
    
Title: In Intellij IDEA how to compare 2 text files that are not part of an open project
Description: 
    
    
                    
I would like to compare 2 files in intellij. Both files are not part of a specific project.

Answer 1: 

    
    
The following works for me in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 14.1.7 on Windows:


Open the first file in the IDE (either by dragging from Windows Explorer into the window, or by File / Open).
In the view menu, choose "Compare With…"
In the "Select Path" dialog that appears, select the second file (either directly, or by dragging from Windows Explorer into the dialog).


It then opens up in the traditional file comparison pane. If you try to edit one of the files, it presents the usual "Are you sure you want to edit a file that's not in your project" dialog, which one can accept if that's what one is trying to do.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can use the "compare with clipboard" feature.

From https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/comparing-files.html#clipboard:

Open the desired file in the editor.

Title: How do I navigate through a method call hierarchy in Xcode 4?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I come from Eclipse, I would like to know if there is a way in Xcode 4 to navigate through method calls like there.
I know I can jump to the definition of a method, but I want to know who is calling that method/function.
The only way I've found is doing a regular text search, but that's not very helpful.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Since Xcode 4.4 the feature to look up the immediate caller and/or callees of a method has been available. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a handy hierarchy view as there is in Eclipse.

What's New in Xcode 4.4


  Xcode can show the callers and callees of the current function or method. This function is accessed from the Show Related Items menu, or by using the Assistant editor and selecting Callers or Callees in the jump bar pop-up menu.

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
here is a visual how to find the caller(s).  Look for the little image i've highlighted in pink.


    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Doing a search is indeed the only way to check where in the code certain messages are being sent. Xcode doesn't have such a functionality. Keep in mind that even if it had, it couldn't be perfect because messages can be composed and sent dynamically at runtime.

Title: eclipse for chrome?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I use eclipse IDE for developing my GWT and android apps.  I would like to transition to a chromebook for my main development computer, but I can't figure out how I would get eclipse "installed".  There is no chrome app version of eclipse, at least not that I can find.  I do see that there are other IDEs in the chrome store, but I don't think they would have all the nifty helper plugins that eclipse has for google developers.  Anybody know if a chrome version of eclipse is coming?  Do others share my desire to develop on a chrome book?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Eclipse is not coming for Chrome OS. You need a JVM to run it and one of the compatible desktops for the UI widgets. So you would have to escape from Chrome OS desktop into base Linux and somehow launch a regular Linux desktop (like GTK) to have any hope of running Eclipse. Also, a typical chromebook is far too underpowered to run a full IDE. 

Here are some options to consider:


Project Orion - A web based IDE from many of the same people who develop Eclipse. One of the goals is to enable Eclipse-like capabilities for platforms like iOS, Android, Chrome OS, etc. It has quite a few base IDE capabilities already, but not a lot of plugins just yet. Probably not going to see something as sophisticated as ADT for a while if ever. Google would have to implement Android emulators in JavaScript. Not an easy task.
Run Eclipse on another machine and use a remote desktop from your chromebook.
Run Eclipse Che on another machine or cloud server and use Chrome 

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The most straightforward and transparent way I was able to do so was to do a combination of things (some of which was mentioned in previous answers):


install crouton (alongside an ubuntu chroot) - this is not dual booting but running Ubuntu side by side with Chrome OS just alternating between both windowing systems.
install crouton chrome extension &amp; xiwi - this enables running the X11 windows in the ubuntu chroot as native Chrome OS windows that can be easily alternated into.
install a JDK inside the ubuntu chroot.
download, mount and execute eclipse-installer.
once the eclipse distribution of choice is installed, for ease I symlinked the main eclipse executable to /usr/local/bin/eclipse and am able to run it from Chrome OS via crouton/xiwi: sudo startxiwi eclipse


Here's a screenshot of what it looks like when done:


    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Eclipse requires a JVM (maybe even a full-blown JDK), so there's no way to make it into a Chrome app. You could enable developer mode and try to install a Linux JDK since Chrome seems to be running Linux under the hood.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Do others share my desire to develop on a chrome book? 

The solution is to load a normal linux distribution and run IDE from there. I'm using a netbook with intel n260, 1G ram, 1.6G Hz. NetBeans runs quite well. A chromebook runs more than twice faster, I'm sure it will be good enough. 

As to how to load a linux, there is the Ubuntu on Cr-48 page that explains how to do it in depth. And also this very user friendly blog on arstechnica, or this blog on liliputting.

Yes! I share your desire to program on a Chromebook! While I am still a high-schooler, I am an amateur Java and Python programmer. My school provides with a class set of about 30 Chromebooks per classroom, and I didn't know how to run my code on them. I had Eclipse on my Windows desktop at home.

When I looked around online, I found something called codenvy.io. It is basically an Eclipse Che IDE that runs online. It uses Docker images to start up a workspace, runs all in the cloud, and a free account has 3 GB of RAM. 

It suited my needs, and I loved it! You should check it out.
    
    
Title: Python correctness (i.e., lint) analyzing for Notepad++
Description: 
    
    
                    
Does anyone know of anything like pylint or pychecker for notepad++? Or perhaps how to use pylint in notepad++.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you install the Python Script plugin, then you can add a new script with the following lines to get pretty good results:

console.show()
console.clear()
console.run('cmd.exe /c '
            + 'C:\\Python26\\Scripts\\pylint.bat --reports=n -f parseable '
            + '"%s"' % notepad.getCurrentFilename())


The output will include hyperlinks to the lines with the errors/warnings (if the filenames don't have spaces in them...)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The option "-f parseable" is deprecated in the current version of Pylint.

The current equivalent alternative is:

console.run('cmd.exe /c '
        + 'C:\\Python26\\Scripts\\pylint.bat --reports=n '
        + '--msg-template="%s" %s' 
        % ( '{path}:{line}: {msg_id}({symbol}), {obj} {msg}', notepad.getCurrentFilename()))


Note: python path can be different e.g. C:\\Python27.

Note2: double quotes in --msg-template="..." are important
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You could install PyLint using C:\Python34\Scripts&gt;pip install pylint and use it via Notepad++'s Run... command (F5):

C:\Python34\Scripts\pylint.bat "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
None of the other answers worked for me, but this does:


Install PyLint using C:\Python34\Scripts\pip.exe install pylint
Install NppExec via the Plugin Manager, press F6, and save this script as "PyLint 3.4":

NPP_SAVE
cd "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"
//env_set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-16-le
env_set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
C:\Python34\Scripts\pylint.exe --reports=n -f parseable "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"

You can link those paths using NppExec's Console Output Filters. Press Shift+F6 and enable this filter with Red set to FF:

%FILE%:%LINE%:*


Then double clicking a red line focuses the specified location in the editor.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
You should use the Executable instead of the Batch if you want to use Pylint within NotePad++.

Go to the Configuration from Python Script and create a new .py File to run Pylint from that. (i called my file npphelper.py)
(Add that npphelper.py to Menu-items and Toolbar-icons, then you can execute it by pressing a Button.)

This will run Pylint into Notepad++, i splitted the Command into 2 Parts:

pyLint = 'C:\\PROGRA~1\\Python35\\Scripts\\pylint.exe --reports=n'
console.show()
console.clear()
console.run('%s "%s"' % (pyLint, notepad.getCurrentFilename()))



Path to pylint.exe (i used a Shortname instead of Doublequotes)
The File you want to check with Pylint (actualy returns the Path from active Tab)


(You have to change the Paths so that it fits to your Installation...)

All you have to do now is saving this npphelper.py, open the Tab with your Project-File and run the npphelper.py you created for pylint. (e.g. via button)



If you don't want to use the default Configuration then generate a pylintrc Template (save them where you want). I've done it via CMD with the following Command:

pylint.exe --generate-rcfile&gt;&gt;myfilename.pylintrc


Then you need to change some lines into the npphelper.py:

rcfile = 'C:\\PROGRA~1\\Python35\\Scripts\\myrcfile.pylintrc'
pyLint = 'C:\\PROGRA~1\\Python35\\Scripts\\pylint.exe --reports=n --rcfile="%s"' % rcfile
console.show()
console.clear()
console.run('%s "%s"' % (pyLint, notepad.getCurrentFilename()))




I've installed Python Script 1.0.8.0 with all the Extras using the .msi File here.
(Using the PluginManager in Notepad++ gives you version 1.0.6.0 instead of 1.0.8.0)

I use Windows 7 with Notepad++ 6.9.1, Python 3.5.1 and Pylint 1.5.5.

Title: How do you disable the CPU window in Delphi 7
Description: 
    
    
                    
When stepping a program in Delphi 7, the CPU window sometimes pops up and then steps through that instructions. I find this an annoyance as I wish to only step Pascal Code. 

Does anyone know how to disable this CPU pop-up? 

I would not be sorry if this window never ever shows. 

It did not happen on Delphi 5 which was my previous IDE that I used for Delphi. I do use the Step-Over button mostly and only step-into when wanting to get into detail of a used (pascal) unit.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Delphi does not, by default, step into the CPU window. So the answer to your question is not that it can not be done. Maybe the question should be: What did I do that causes this.

EDIT:
From the comments I understand that it happens when you press pause to break in the debugger.
It is not strange that it stops on the exact place where it was executing when you hit pause.
This could very well be in some Windows code for which you do not have the source.
By choosing Run -&gt; Run to Next Source Line or Shift-F7 your program will execute a bit further until it hits some code for which it does have source code.   

This is the answer to your problem, but remember that you could have breaked in a spot where you never reach a next source line.

You can use /** &lt;Enter&gt;.
I have found a way to do it. I personally use Doxygen for documentation.
CLion plans to integrate it.
You have to write all of it at this time. But when you have documented your code, you can build it with CMake (and then it appears in your build target on CLion).  

Here's an example:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2)
project(doxygen_test)

find_package(Doxygen)

set(SOURCE_FILES main.cc)

if(DOXYGEN_FOUND)

  set(DOXYGEN_INPUT ${SOURCE_FILES})
  set(DOXYGEN_OUTPUT ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile)

  add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT ${DOXYGEN_OUTPUT}
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo_append "Building API Documentation..."
    COMMAND ${DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE} ${DOXYGEN_INPUT}
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Done."
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
    DEPENDS ${DOXYGEN_INPUT}
  )

  add_custom_target(apidoc ALL DEPENDS ${DOXYGEN_OUTPUT})

  add_custom_target(apidoc_forced
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo_append "Building API Documentation..."
    COMMAND ${DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE} ${DOXYGEN_INPUT}
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Done."
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
  )

endif(DOXYGEN_FOUND)

set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")


add_executable(doxygen_test ${SOURCE_FILES})

Starting from 2016.2 EAP CLion supports Doxygen (http://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2016/05/keep-your-code-documented/). Start with typing “/**” or “/*!” and then press Enter. In case your function has parameters, returns a value or throws an exception, you’ll get a stub to fill with the documentation text

Answer 1: 

    
    
I will share some of the feelings from using it for quite a while now. Things that are roughly the same quality as in Eclipse+Pydev+mercurial:


editor, code-completion
debugger features


Things that are better:


autoimport
color schemes (Norway today rocks)
Mercurial support (though it is getting better and better in Eclipse)


Things that are worse:


zipped egg packages are not recognized for either code completion or the autoimport
libdyn packages (e.g. datetime) are not recognized
debugger is having trouble with multiprocessing package
you cannot choose file from outside of the project (/usr/bin/paster) to be the main file (this is what I use to debug Pylons applications)


Does anyone have something to add to the list?
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
BraveSirFoobar, it would be nice to know more about what problems you found -- the very, very slow part, as well as the crash. The first time you run the IDE it will index information about your Python platform and project and libraries - such that it can do quick code completion, go to declaration etc. later - but once that's done it's not supposed to be slow - but there might be bugs.

Mercurial should definitely be supported well, since the NetBeans project itself (and Solaris and Java) are all hosted in Mercurial repositories.

We plan to have really deep support for Python, much in the style of our Ruby support. One of the things which really helped in our Ruby work was the feedback from our early adopters, so if you try Python and have issues with it, please let us know so we can fix it.

Having worked with PyDev and PyDev extension for Eclipse for the past few months, the move to NetBeans has been a very pleasurable one.

Without having to hunt all the different plug-ins for PyDev and Eclipse, NetBeans had everything I needed out of the box:
auto completion, super fast index search, style control import control, you name it.
And it seemed LESS bug prone than Eclipse (which is pretty stable).
Also, the built-in Vim like auto code snippets it uses are just fantastic.
IMO, it beats Eclipse hands down.

Title: Why is the Eclipse IDE getting slower?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have downloaded the latest Eclipse IDE, Galileo, and tested it to see if it good for developing web applications in Java. I have also tried the Ganymede version of Eclipse and find that is it also good.

My Problem is that sometimes it hangs and stops responding while I am developing. Sometimes when I open a file, Eclipse hangs and does not respond for awhile. It seems that Eclipse is going slower and my job is getting slower because of the time that I am spending waiting for the response of Eclipse.

When I went to NetBeans 6.7, it was good and the performance was good. The loading is faster and the IDE responds well during my development testing.

My computer has 1 GB of RAM and a 1.6 GHz CPU.

What can you say about this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'm using Eclipse PDT 2.1 (also based on Galileo) for PHP development, and I've been using Eclipse-based IDE for 3 years now ; my observation is that 1 GB of RAM is generally not enough to run Eclipse + some kind of web server + DB server + browser + other stuff :-(

I'm currently working with a 1GB of RAM machine, and it's slow as hell... Few months ago, I had a 2GB of RAM machine, and things were going really fine -- and I'm having less software running on the "new machine" than I had on the other one !


Other things that seem to affect Eclipse's responsivness is :


opening a project that's on a network drive (accessing the sources that are on a development server via samba, for instance)
sometimes, using an SVN-plugin like SUbversive seems to freeze Eclipse for a couple of seconds/minutes


A nice to do with languages like PHP (might not be OK for JAVA projects, though) is to disable "automatically build" in "project"'s menu.

Answer 4: 

    
    
Our machines are bigger : 2GB ram, and faster CPU.

I'm sure that, as all software, Eclipse gets bigger and slower when upgrading version, due to all new functionnalities included. The good news is that from time to time, a release also brings some notable performance improvement. But in my experience, each time I tried using a ten-year old software on my current machine, it was lightning fast, so I'm sure the tendency is to get slower. I agree that this is a sad for us, when we don't get a better machine.

Netbeans sped up quite a bit in the last few years, perhaps your comparison is relative to the speed of netbeans?

Lately I had to up the size of my eclipse -Xmx from 64mb and decided I might as well go to 512, and it got a bit chunkier.  at 64 I never saw the slightest pause, when it actually NEEDS a collection at 512 because of a long-running process that's not letting the background GC thread run, it can get a little pausey

Suppose I have a server that runs on Linux on which I would like to develop software (mainly OCaml, C/C++ and Java).

Is there a way to "remote develop" these things? I mean an IDE that allows me to modify files remotely (they are then uploaded when modified and saved) and to compile through SSH (basically invoking make or omake).

I was looking for something that makes this process transparent to the developer, without caring of doing things by hand. I'm used to use Eclipse so I wonder if a plugin to achieve this exists or if are there other choices?

Mind that it may happen that the local machine it not able to build software I intend to (for example for OCaml) so it should rely just on remote connection.

Thanks in advance
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I think your answer is IDE-centric.

KDE's ioslaves support access over both SFTP and SSH (using fish, which uses a Perl script uploaded to the remote machine). I believe Gnome also has a virtual file system (gvfs) which supports remote filesystem access.

My recommendation, therefore, is to choose an IDE which supports a virtual filesystem that can operate over SSH/SFTP and allows you to specify the build command. You would then only need to specify the build command which would get its output from the remote make command (for example, vim has a makeprg option which can be set to any arbitrary command).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can use X11 forwarding. Even if you are connecting from a Windows machine.

Answer 3: 

    
    
Well the simplest idea I can think of, though it is rather brute force would be to just open up a file share to the server and then edit the file directly through Eclipse.

If that doesn't work for Java at least you could make use of Maven to do some of those tasks. I am less certain about invoking Make though.

Using a build tool (Hudson for example) you could put a build agent on your remote server, check your changes into your repository as normal, and have it do a build when you check in changes (it will either do a repository hook or poll for changes, probably). Your build process will be the same, it will simply be automated. :-)

emacs has tramp, which lets you both open and save remote files, and open a shell on a remote system. Working with tramp is almost exactly like working with local files, except for the filename.

If building is the problem, have you thought about simply using an automated build system where you commit to svn and the system then automatically builds the software? I've heard many good things about these sorts of systems, although I haven't quite tried any out myself.

As for remote development, a SVnDAV solution might be reasonable. It basically commits your every save and is completely transparent to the text editor you're using. However a probably much nicer solution would simply be to use a networked drive/directory and edit files remotely. On all unix-based systems this should work completely transparently to both the developer and the text editor.

If you already have a linux server then I would suggest setting up a simple VPN server.  I have done this in the past and it works pretty well. This way you can connect and modify/build your files with any "local" OS.  I did this cause I use mac, pc and linux through various parts of the day and in multiple locations, so the VPN allowed me to edit files remotely w/out having to allow file sharing over the internet.

There are plenty of tutorials about how to achieve this even if you are newer to linux.  I use ubuntu server on my linux box and here are the tutorial I have used.

Title: Eclipse - change order for Open Declaration / Implementation / Return Type
Description: 
    
    
                    
If I press Ctrl and the mouse is over a method call, a menu is opened:


  Open Declaration
  
  Open Implementation
  
  Open Return Type


If I hit Ctrl + click on the method call, the first option will be considered (Open Declaration).

I want to change the order of these options to:


  Open Implementation
  
  Open Declaration
  
  Open Return Type


Is it possible to achieve the second order? ( or to let them in the same order but change "the default" for Ctrl + click to be Open Implementation )

I know that I can uncheck the "Open Declaration" from Window 
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't think you can re-order the priorities, but as a workaround you can change the modifier keys for Open Implementation so that you can invoke it directly without the other options getting in the way. In the Preferences dialog, search for "hyper" in the search box (without the quotes), select Hyperlinking and then select the Open Implementation entry. At the bottom of the list, you can change the modifiers (for example, I set it to Ctrl + Alt).

Title: How do I know which Eclipse M2E connectors I have installed?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I understand that the new M2E within Eclipse has pluggable connectors which help configure the Eclipse project based on what they see in the POM when the project is imported.

I also believe that (for the most part) these connectors are automatically installed when they are needed (on demand).  I've been using them with some success.  Recently I manually installed the M2E-WTP connector because I wanted to try it out.

I installed it via  Eclipse-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Maven-&gt;Discovery where I also found a bunch of additional connectors.  But the discovery window seems to only show you ones that you DON'T have installed.

Description: 
    
    
                    
What are the steps necessary to configure jEdit to be an IDE?  I basically want to compile and debug Java programs.  There are so many Java plug-ins.  I'm not sure which ones are best.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You'll need the ProjectViewer and Sidekick plug-ins at a minimum.  You'll probably also want one of the various support plug-ins like:


AntFarm for dealing with Apache Ant.
Any of the beautifier plug-ins (which one depends on your tastes and which languages you want to support).
BufferTabs if you want to see all your opened files listed at once.
Console for running apps, builds, etc.
CTagsSidekick (make sure you get Exuberant Tags too!) to make the sidekicks more useful.
JavaSidekick for obvious reasons.
Maven if that's your cup of poison.
XML because you can't do Java programming without a steaming brown heap of XML.  :)


You'll need to explore other possible plug-ins later, of course, but this should get you started.



Edited to add:

As requested, debugging options.  I don't use debuggers often, so I can't vouch for any of these.


The JSwat plug-in integrates, surprisingly, JSwat into jEdit.
JavaDebugger (creative naming that!) integrates another debugger.

    
    
Title: Visual Studio 2015 - User tasks gone?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've recently switched from Visual Studio 2013 to 2015 and converted all of my old projects. However, now I can't seem to find my user tasks anymore? There used to be a drop-down menu in the task list, but it looks like that's gone in the new version, unless I'm missing something.

Have user tasks been removed? If so, is there a way I can still retrieve them from my project?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The documentation on MSDN has been updated with this paragraph:


  The user task feature has been removed in Visual Studio 2015. When you open a solution which has user task data from Visual Studio 2013 and earlier in Visual Studio 2015, the user task data in your .suo file will not be affected, but the user tasks will not be displayed in the task list.  
  
  If you wish to continue to access and update your user task data, you should open the project in Visual Studio 2013 and copy the content of any user tasks into your preferred project management tool (such as Team Foundation Server).

Title: An alternative IDE for Sybase Powerbuilder
Description: 
    
    
                    
Does anyone know of an alternative IDE for Sybase Powerbuilder?  It feels pretty clunky, after working with VS2008 and Eclipse.

If not, has anyone successfully worked with this language outside the IDE? I'm not against using a simple text editor, but I find edit-import-regenerate-test-export-edit is clunkier than simply using the Powerbuilder editor.

To date, the only tools I have had any success with are:


PowerGen, for builds (with NUnit and CruiseControl.NET)
ConTEXT, which has syntax highlighting for Powerbuilder 
PBL Peeper, which has some interesting features not present in the IDE


EDIT: I added a bounty to draw some wider attention to the question.  It would be a very nice thing to have, if it exists.

EDIT: Well that was disappointing.  The bounty apparently did not cause even 1 new person to look at the question.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
None that I'm aware of, although you could probably use a source control tool, edit in your source control repository, and Get Latest Version from the PB IDE to shorten your text editor cycle. Be warned that there are hacks required to edit anything over 128 ASCII. (My guess is that this is to allow everything Unicode to be source controlled in the most restrictive source control tools.)

As Paul said, PB12 is coming with based on the Visual Studio shell, and will include things like collapsible code blocks, Intellisense, etc.... However, for PB12, this will only be used for WPF targets and a few .NET-type targets (like assemblies), last I heard. Win32 targets will continue to use the "classic" IDE.

Good luck,

Terry.

Answer 2: 

    
    
The PowerBuilder IDE is clunky, but I don't think developing completely outside the PowerBuilder IDE is a good idea.  I think there are just too many dependencies right now.

However, the IDE for PowerBuilder 12 will be built using Microsoft's Visual Studio Isolated Shell so it ought to be much better when that is released.  Also, I believe they'll be doing away with the PBL format which ought to make source control much easier to work with.

Certainly something to watch.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
What I do is right-click the object and edit source. Then I copy the text and paste it into Notepad++ to edit. I copy and paste back to PowerBuilder, then I can save and see any errors. I've got a fairly decent User Defined Language for PowerScript if anyone's interested.

Added:
Please be aware that I've seen the PB Source editor corrupt DataWindows. They were all large DataWindows. To be safe always export DataWindows to edit.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
One tool that will most probably make your PB experience way better is Visual Expert, which provides a good source browser. Such a tool should have been integrated into the PB IDE a long time ago, IMHO. Only problem is that it's not free, as opposed to the other tools you mention.

Regarding using external source editors, you can probably take advantage of OrcaScript, which is a scripting language that lets you perform actions such as export and import of PB objects from outside of the IDE. It will require some effort, but you can setup a basic dev env using batch files with ORCA scripts and some additional external tools. However, this setup will lack any visual editing capabilities, which means no (feasible) GUI or DW work. If you're mostly into NVOs, it could work. But then if that's the case, why use PB in the first place?...

I too have heard PB12's use of VS will be limited to some .NET stuff, which will probably benefit only a very small portion of the PB programmers community. I'm afraid the rest of us are stuck with the awful IDE for years to come.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Other than exporting the source and editing it I don't know of another IDE for PB. One problem you may have is that the exported source contains a lot of syntax that is not documented in the manuals.  The PB IDE generates this code but there is no support for creating it by hand.  I think you are stuck with the PB IDE

In my modest five Years of experiences starting with Powerbuilder 5/6, now using PB 10, I tempt to :


build my own browser from the classdefinition object based on Powerbuilder
tried to use autohotkey in order to open datawindows comfortable (we have several thousands in the project and i am two-finger-driven)
truly investigated in the idea using an external editor/IDE suppoted by an autohotkey script which is undermined by sybase allowing only mouse-click-usage of PB
using Visual Expert which is neither a truly integration in the IDE, nor is really worth in analyzing datwindow/powerscript interaction
ending by build hopes on PB12 Visual Studio, which lacks - depending on compatibility issues - ...


... i came to the conclusion that there will be no chance in improving Powerbuilder to an state-of-the-art language

In my philosophy - I obtained during those years - I distinguish between two types of OOP-oriented languages:


the one that award using object-orientation like C#, Python, Ruby (C++) etc. and very much the Java-Eclipse/Netbeans-Universe does
the other one that punish using object-orientation like Powerbuilder and the old Visual Basic, for example (which is causative the OOP-Idea comes afterwards and is "plugged in").
Especially the demand that all object should always be compiled (regenerated) and that you could't work with ancestors and descandants concurrently makes it painful to use real OOP.

I know this post is over a year old, but I thought I'd throw this out if you are interested.  Adobe is developing a product now that may fit what you are looking for.  If you have the creative cloud, there is a preview of the program.  It is called Edge Code in the creative cloud, but it is being developed as a standalone, open source, platform independent code editor as well.  I'm not sure why, but outside of the creative cloud, it is called Brackets.  It doesn't do a live view in the program itself, but it does automatically open the document in Chrome, and updates as you make changes.  The really interesting thing is that the program itself is written in html, css, and JS, so that it should be easy to customize to your liking.  It is currently in beta, and can be downloaded at

I made my own open source coding playground called kodeWeave (which saves and retrieves your weaves as a Github Gist). It's available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android and Online (I also plan on releasing it for iOS and Windows Phone too).




Some other good coding playgrounds to tryout are CodePen, CSSDeck, Plunker, JSBin, jsFiddle, Liveweave.

There is also Brackets which is an open source project created by Adobe (It's basically the open source version of Edge Code). The nice thing about Brackets is it runs off it's own server locally on your device so if you're using a library like JSZip it works right away. In addition whenever you save a change made in a file in Brackets your app will reload in Chrome's Debugger (launched from Brackets) So debugging is very fast and easy, not to mention there's lots of plugins that are made to increase productivity. It's really tremendous!

Title: Compile C# on a (not for) Windows 8 ARM Tablet
Description: 
    
    
                    
Would it be possible to code and compile C#, on a Windows 8 Tablet (WinRT) (the ARM processor edition)?

Basically it comes down to this:


Is there a C# compiler that runs on ARM?
Is there and IDE that can run in WinRT?


If the above is true, I don't see any issue, but I currently can't find if the C# compiler runs on ARM (only a lot of posts about compiling for ARM). I've also looked at SharpDevelop, and found that their source code compiles for "Any CPU", which according to this post: Windows RT and c#, means that it'll run on ARM. 

Sharpdevelop however requires .NET 4.0 "Full" runtime, which I couldn't find if WinRT has or not. I'm betting it doesn't, as WinRT is supposed to be a really lightweight edition of Windows.

As a sidenote, I know that Windows tablets will come in two editions, one for ARM and one for classic processors. The classic processors will run a normal Windows 8 edition, which means it can run all the native applications. Compiling C# wouldn't be an issue here - so the question is rather, can I do the same on ARM?



This would be awesome for travelling and trying out new ideas quickly. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Currently:  no, and no.

It would certainly be possible to build a Windows Store app that contains an IDE and a C# compiler.  However, you would not be able to run any programs built using such an app.  Windows Store apps run with reduced privileges in a sandbox.  In this sandbox, the CLR will only load system assemblies and assemblies contained in the app package. The app package is immutable and cannot be modified at runtime.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Actually, the .Net framework on the surface includes csc.exe, the Csharp compiler.
I've gotten code to compile, but WinRt doesn't seem to like it being run without proper signing. 

The IDE won't happen for a while, not yet at least. I'm sure that with proper signing, it is possible to run a compiled executable.

Or the other guy might be right and it isn't just an issue of signing.

Title: Import errors with Pycharm
Description: 
    
    
                    
Edit: the problem is Pycharm is not loading LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. Everything works if I add this into Pychar's environment. Why isn't it loading it?

I'm having trouble importing modules for gnuradio. First, everything works if I just run the python file from the command line, and everything loads just fine in the interpreter. There is only a problem using pycharm. Furthermore, GNU Radio is installed correctly.

PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages


I added the python interpreter, and since the module loads fine from the interpreter I'm not sure why I had to add the path to pycharm. Anyways, I added the location where the the gnuradio module is: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gnuradio; however, it was wrong. The correct path to load was the parent directory: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages. I'm wondering why this is.

More importantly, after loading the library I get this compiler error:

File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gnuradio/gr/runtime_swig.py", line 24, in swig_import_helper
    _mod = imp.load_module('_runtime_swig', fp, pathname, description)
ImportError: libgnuradio-pmt-3.7.2git.so.0.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


The file in question is located in /usr/local/lib, however I've added every possible path to tell it where it is but no luck. Also, I've added /usr/lib:/usr/local/lib to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH and ran ldconfig with no success. Only thing I could think of.

In PyCharm, you can change the configuration of the file you are trying to run.

Steps to edit configuration using pycharm:
1. Right click on the file in project explorer of the pycharm.
2. Run the file. (This run file with import errors)
3. There is a run icon at the top right corner of pycharm. Next to the arrow, there is an dropdown box. Click on the arrow and select 'Edit configurations ...'
4. In the edit configuration window, change the python interpreter path to the path that has the package you need installed.
5. Like the one shown in the last snapshot, if you have different version of python installed, the file needs to know which python version to run.

Also, if you have both python2 and python3 installed in your machine and if you use pip install, it will install the packages under python2 directory. so you need to used pip3 install if you want your packages under python3 directory.

I faced the similar problem yesterday but on windows 8.1 platform with gnuradio-3.7 version. It seems that "_runtime_swig" is missing in gnuradio-3.7/lib/site-packages/gnuradio/gr directory, as stated under the raised issue https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues/2637. A patch to this problem has been provided for gnuradio-3.8 version.

Upgrading my gnuradio version to 3.8 has installed the missing "_runtime_swig" under gnuradio-3.7/lib/site-packages/gnuradio/gr directory and then I had to fix the missing dependencies (DLL)s  to this module by adding `C:\Program Files\gnuradio-3.8\bin' folder to the "Path" system variable by following the answer in ImportError: No module named _analog_swig 

This might be helpful for someone else facing similar problem here. Cheers!
    
    
Title: What shell is SSMS 2012 based on and how can I darken the theme?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a dark query editing environment, but the object explorer and other elements default to the white background. I really like VS 2012 dark theme, and was hoping someone knew of a way to get SSMS 2012 UI elements darker. 

I've googled to no avail. There doesn't seem to be much documentation on SSMS and themes. I guess all SQL folks just like it plain and simple. 

How do I darken the UI elements on SSMS 2012?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
SSMS 2012 is based on VS 2010. There is an extension for VS 2010 called Color Themes Extension, but SSMS does not have an Extensions menu item, so you have to copy the extension manually to {$SqlServerPath}/Tools/Binn/ManagementStudio/Extensions. 

You can then install a theme called Expression, which is a dark theme based on Microsoft Expression product line and it works for SSMS, but unfortunately some controls like Object Explorer's background will stay white. 

It's described in detail on this blog.

Do check out the autocomplpop and TTrCodeAssistor plug-ins.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
As was already suggested, install the autocomplpop plugin. Then,
to trigger omincompletion as you type for C files, you could add the following to your .vimrc:

let g:AutoComplPop_Behavior = { 
\ 'c': [ {'command' : "\&lt;C-x&gt;\&lt;C-o&gt;",
\       'pattern' : ".",
\       'repeat' : 0}
\      ]  
\}


If you don't want to trigger omnicompletion for every character typed, change the pattern value to suit your needs. For information on how to further customize, look at the documentation in the comment header of autocomplpop.vim

Moreover, to get a popup window with function parameters also add the following to your .vimrc:

let g:AutoComplPop_CompleteoptPreview = 1


To make it work make sure you generated a tags file with ctags.

YouCompleteMe is a nice alternative that offers fuzzy autocompletion and uses clang to deal with the semantics.

Title: Syntax-highlight Python in a vim fold line
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have found that code-folding helps me organize my files better. Thus, at the bottom of my ~/.vimrc, I enable vim code folding by default:

""Folding
set foldmethod=indent
set foldnestmax=2
nnoremap &lt;space&gt; za
vnoremap &lt;space&gt; zf
"set nofoldenable       "set this to disable folding on file open


This has the advantages of using SPACE to toggle folds at the cursor, or if they start to annoy me I can use zR to unfold everything.

However, I'm also addicted to syntax highlighting.  I use Dmitry Vasiliev's python.vim, but it doesn't highlight syntax in a fold line:



The lack of syntax highlighting for Field('id', type='integer', unique=True, notnull=True), makes it hard on my eyes when I'm used to seeing the highlight colors

What I'm looking for is a python.vim that supports syntax highlighting on a fold summary... if it Dmitry's did, it would highlight the strings in green something like this:



I want to continue using foldmethod=indent, if possible.  Is there a way to get syntax highlights on fold summaries?  Perhaps another python.vim?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This question was asked previously and the answer was that it's not possible since the fold headline is not actually part of the file, thus never gets scanned by the highlighter.  :(
    
    
Title: Use Xcode as Javascript IDE, possible?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm working on a Javascript-intensive web app designed to run on iPhone/iPad for now. It also works on all Webkit browsers (Safari + Chrome).

I have a home-made MVC framework consisting of many JavaScript files: one for each view, one for each controller, many "helper" classes.

I also have a bunch of LESS files, one "main" including each LESS file for each view (eg. if I have a UIListView.js, I also have a UIListView.less).

Currently I'm working with MacVim and Less.app, and doing tests on both iPhone/iPad simulators, real iPhone/iPads, and sometimes Safari or Chrome when I really need to do "hardcore" debugging with the developer tools. All my files are stores in my ~/Sites/projectX folder, which I browse using my Mac's built-in web server.

This is OK while developing, I have many little files referenced by my index.htm but it doesn't matter as I'm on my intranet over WiFi.

What I'd like to achieve is a more "project-oriented" approach. Just as when I develop an iOS project in Xcode, I'd like to use XCode for all my development needs, keep all my source files in a directory separate from ~/Sites, say ~/Desktop/projectX. I'd like to have two configurations (debug and release) to use with "Build and run" :


the "debug" config would simply compile the main .less file (which includes all small .less files), copy the JS + CSS + HTM file over to some directory (~/Sites/projectX_debug), along with all graphic resources. Then depending on the "sub-configuration" chosen, launch either the iPhone Simulator, the iPad Simulator, Safari, or Chrome, clear its cache (via AppleScript?) and open the index.htm
the "release" config that would glue all JS files together and minify them, compile and minify the .less file, change the index.htm to reference only the glued JS, then optimize all PNGs with pngout/pngcrush/whatever before sending all the archive to a local directory (~/Sites/projectX_release) or by sftp to my production server.


I believe I can achieve if not all but most of this using the build phases of XCode 4, maybe using GNU makefiles or some kind of preprocessor, but I'm lost at where to start.

Does someone already have this kind of setup for using Xcode to do something else than Mac/iOS development, but still using the "classical" concept of build phases/makefiles traditional to most IDEs?

(An acceptable workaround would be to simply create a bash script to handle that — I can already manage it by myself, but I'd really like to use the integrated XCode features, and just pressing Cmd-R to "compile" and run my project in debug mode).


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I will try and step through the things you should do...


  the "debug" config would simply compile the main .less file (which
  includes all small .less files),



I would create a build rule to handle .less files, use a script to compile them.



  copy the JS + CSS + HTM file over to
  some directory (~/Sites/projectX_debug), along with all graphic
  resources. Then depending on the "sub-configuration" chosen, launch
  either the iPhone Simulator, the iPad Simulator, Safari, or Chrome,
  clear its cache (via AppleScript?) and open the index.htm



For this you just need to add your files to the copy phase in the 'Build Phases' section. 
You can set your build directory in your target's 'Build Settings' section (~/Sites/projectX_debug, if you'd like).



  the "release" config that would glue all JS files together and minify
  them, compile and minify the .less file, change the index.htm to
  reference only the glued JS, then optimize all PNGs with
  pngout/pngcrush/whatever before sending all the archive to a local
  directory (~/Sites/projectX_release) or by sftp to my production
  server.



For this part you might want to create a new target and add different rules and settings.


OR

If the above is too complicated:


Write your two bash scripts.
Make two targets.
Add your bash script as a build phase in each target.


Hope that helps.

For vue-cli3, you need to specify a full path to node_modules/@vue/cli-service/webpack.config.js as a webpack configuration file in Settings | Languages &amp; Frameworks | JavaScript | Webpack.

Note that this only works for JavaScript; webpack aliases are not resolved when using components written in TypeScript, path mappings in tsconfig.json should be used instead
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Webstorm already supports resolving alias. Webstorm read your webpack.config.js in background.

If you're using vue-cli 3, we don't have webpack.config.js, but you can create webpack.config.js file manually

module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": require("path").resolve(__dirname, "src") // change this to your folder path

webstorm will resolve it automatically

I'm running Rubymine 5.4.x on Windows 7 (but that shouldn't really matter for this question) and I have managed to delete projects and seemingly rename them before, but I am stuck this time.

In the past, this is what I've done:

rename all instances of your old project name in all the files in the .idea folder in your project directory.
rename all instances of your old project name in all the files in the RubyMine config folder and subfolders (on windows, for RM 5.x - %USERPROFILE%\.RubyMine50\config)
rename all instances of your old project name in all the files in the RubyMine system folder and subfolders (on windows, for RM 5.x - %USERPROFILE%\.RubyMine50\config)
rename all FILES that contain your old project name to the new project name, a few examples - rename:

your actual project directory which would probably have the same name as the project to the new project name
the .idea/&lt;your_project_name&gt;.iml file



In Summary:

By deleting or modifying these files/folders I have managed to delete or rename the projects that appear in my &quot;project list&quot; in that startup screen/Create Project/Open Project Modal for RubyMine, and in the ReOpen Projects menu.

However, this time around I can't get the name of this particular project rename... that is it appears with the correct path in these lists, but the incorrect name.

Furthermore, the incorrect name appears in my Project ToolWindow once the IDE is launch, although directly to the right of it in parenthesis is the correct path.

OK... I just figured it out... IN ADDITION to everything above... you need to rename the .name file (it's just one line with the name of your project) in the .idea directory in the root directory of your project

In addition to modifying the .idea/.name file, there is also a .idea/&lt;project name&gt;.iml file. Open this, do a find/replace with &lt;project name&gt; and &lt;new project name&gt;, then rename this file as well.

Here's the equivalent tutorial in C++:

Qt4: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qt-widgets-codeeditor-example.html

Answer 2: 

    
    
I know that Qt tutorial recommends using QPlainTextEdit for text editor implementations, and that the question (except as mentioned in the title), is more general than dealing (absolutely) with a QTextEdit widget, but I succeeded in implementing the behaviour (line numbers + current line number highlight), and I think this might be helpful for some people (like me) who really want to keep going with the Rich Text widget, and want to share my implementation (which is far from perfect - quite fast coded...).

protected:
    void paintEvent(QPaintEvent *event);

}

void LineNumberArea::paintEvent(QPaintEvent *event) {
    ((QTextEditHighlighter *)codeEditor)-&gt;lineNumberAreaPaintEvent(event);
}



Answer 3: 

    
    
I was looking for a line numbers painting solution for QTextEdit (not QPlainTextEdit), and I found the previous answer with sample code for QTextEdit is useful, but when we set custom line height in QTextEdit's associated SyntaxHighligher, it doesn't work reliably.

To fix that problem, I figured out a simpler way to determine the y coordinate of each block rect by using this code:

// Here is the key to obtain the y coordinate of the block start
QTextCursor blockCursor(block);
QRect blockCursorRect = this-&gt;cursorRect(blockCursor);


And then we can draw line number of each block via:

painter.drawText(-5, blockCursorRect.y() /* + a little offset to align */,
                 m_lineNumberArea-&gt;width(), fixedLineHeight,
                 Qt::AlignRight, number);


This seems much simpler and more reliable than calculating the block y coordinate by adding previous block height up.

Hope it helps for someone who is looking for similar solutions.

In the end , I found a solution about this problem. I was give up to continue after couple of days investigation on GGTS and decided to install Intellij 12 on mac. Installed trial licence for İntellij. I was expecting to avoid this problem. However I faced again an another wierd exception on İntellij. I had started to investigate current problem on intellij forums.

As a result,I found following advice to solve issue on intellij environment. The following instruction also solve my GGTS problem on mac.

Grails 2.3.0.RC1 and IntelliJ IDEA: "IDEA hook: Grails not found!"   

it was referencing following solution also on stackoverflow.com

grails-2.3.0.M1 fails to start in IntelliJ IDEA 130.754


  Solution :
  remove all "grails--2.3.0.M1-sources.jar" and "grails--2.3.0.M1-javadocs.jar" from $GRAILS_HOME/dist

Title: When typing in Open Resource dialog, is there a way to find files by directory instead of just the file name?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have been using extensively Ctrl + Shift + to find and open files in my Eclipse project. But sometimes I know the directory where my files are (or part of it) but I don't know exactly their names.

When doing search, it seems it only takes into consideration the name of the files, and not their paths. I'd like to be able to refine the search by path. 

For instance, if I have a folder X with 3 files in it, I'd like that typing X would bring up the 3 files, so I could choose them. Or that it'd actually let me select the X folder itself!

Is there a way to do this in Eclipse?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

Use Ctrl + Shift + R to bring up the 'Open Resource' dialog
Type *X/ to list all files in the folder X. Ex search: *myDir/myFile.
Important: the preceding asterisk (*) is required to make the search apply to folders and paths too.

Title: PyCharm include and modify External library in project
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have an issue where I am developing a Django project which includes other libraries we are also developing.

My current structure is as follows:


Main Project

App1


App2






Libraries

Library 1


Library 2



All libraries have their own setup scripts and are in separate git repositories, and we are adding them in PyCharm in the PYTHONPATH, and referencing them simply by their name. Which works good, but they are not in my current project, which means no re-factoring ( renaming, moving etc... ) and I have to use External search to find my class from the libraries.

How do I set some libraries as project related to make them view-able and refactorable like we do on the currently set project.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Well, you can add other directories as content roots:



Then simply mark the directory as a source root:



This should allow you to refactor, rename and do all the things you've wanted to do.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Another option would be to place libraries into separate project (or go even further and place each library in its own project) and then open this project/these projects side-by-side with the main project. This way you have clear separation between the main project and libraries used. This comes handy when you work on another project using some of the same libraries as then you only need to open already existing project containing libraries and you are done.
    
    
Title: Is there a C++ IDE which handles templates well?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Every IDE I've tried fails to provide code-completion when something template-related is used.
For example, 

boost::shared_ptr&lt;Object&gt; ptr;
ptr-&gt;[cursor is here]


Is there IDE that can provide code completion in this case?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Actually this is a fairly simple template use-case, Qt Creator can handle this easily and more complex template code aswell.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Visual Studio with Visual Assist X handles that case, but still fails more complex code.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I've always use Eclipse C/C++ IDE. It supports code completion as well :)
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
G'day,

As an aside, I'd highly recommend Scott Meyers's excellent "Effective STL" book.

Item 49 "Learn to decipher STL-related compiler diagnostics" is worth the price of admission alone! The info therein is also applicable to decoding complex template related diagnostics beyond STL, e.g. for Boost.

Have fun.

Title: Is there a way to get a Haskell setup on Windows without an installation? (Copy + paste)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am programming on a school-given computer. I need to have a Haskell setup that does no installation (one I can drop on a flash drive and copy on to the C drive or just use from the flash drive perhaps).

I already have Eclipse up and running, so if I could get it on Eclipse without leaving any impact on the system past the Eclipse directory, that would be very good as well.

By no installation, I mean I have to be able to easily remove the program and roughly all traces without any uninstaller tool. All uninstaller tools are likely blocked.

What are my options?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Haskell Platform's Windows installer (of which I'm the maintainer) has a "portable install" option that just extracts the files to the given location and does not touch the registry or any system settings. You can use it to install Haskell Platform to your flash drive, but you'll need to add GHC's location to the PATH manually.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I'm from the future. I'm using Haskell Platform's Windows installer as Mikhail Glushenkov said.


  So you would have to change the computers settings then? –  PyRulez


You can also set environment variables with CMD.exe's SET command. (What're they teaching you kids these days?) Once you've set PATH (or whatever) like this the value will persist for that session and any child sessions. If you start an IDE from the shell - it should have those set (unless there's a previous instance ... maybe) so it should work within the constraints you gave. I'd recommend that you save it to a .bat file

TL:DR; extract the Haskell Platform create shell.bat next to bin/ lib/ et al and paste this into it;

@ECHO OFF
SET PATH=%~dp0/bin;%PATH%
CMD /K


Now run shell.bat and that prompt will be able to find Haskell. Since you can take shell.bat with you - it should be easier to plug-in to a new lab-machine and get working
    
    
Title: Is it possible to specify which network interface for a JVM ( or IDE ) to use
Description: 
    
    
                    
The situation goes like this, I have two network interfaces in my macbook pro. One is a statically defined Ethernet interface and the other one is a DHCP configured wireless interface.

I am trying to figure out how to configure a specific java project to use my statically wired interface only and not simply pick the first one in the list either through the JVM or through my IDEA ( IntelliJ 8 ) 

I have managed to achieve this via an instance of vmware where I have my virtual environment feeding off my wired interface only but this ads performance problems and just general headaches of flipping between windows / osx.

I have so far been unable to find a jvm property that let's me specify which nic gets used nor have I seen documentation for IntelliJ that defines that. If anyone has any ideas on how to solve this as painlessly as possible I would appreciate the help.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes, you can specify by following way:
int port= 52000; //some free port

MulticastSocket msocket = new MulticastSocket(port);

msocket.setInterface(InetAddress.getByName(&quot;172.16.30.205&quot;));

Where 172.16.30.205 is one of my PC's IP address and I would like to communicate through interface.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
java.net.Socket has a constructor which specifies which local IP address to bind to, and since each network interface gets its own IP address, you can use that.
But getting from a java.net.Socket to a higher-level protocol (e.g. HTTP) is another matter entirely, but you don't specify what that would be.
I don't know of a JVM-level way of doing this, sadly, just the above programmatic approach.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The NIC used for comms is selected by the operating system depending on the best 'route' available to what ever address is being accessed.  There is no way for an application that sits above the NIC drivers to select a specific NIC.  You can only get close when you're listening on a port bound at a specific address, which is only applicable if you're running a server.

You could try modifying the 'metric' of the route specific to a NIC to force the OS to prefer it.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
This may be of help: 
Identify Network Interface Example

"[I]f you have a preference or otherwise need to specify which NIC to use, you can query the system for the appropriate interfaces and find an address on the interface you want to use."
    
    
Title: Eclipse - editor colors - a healthy configuration

I use Eclipse for Java, Python, C(++) and so on. 
I'm accustomed to Vim and the dark color schemes. The default white background just hurts my eyes. And that's a real problem. It doesn't seem Eclipse supports any schemes? I tried a Plugin  but it doesn't seem to work for MacOS and Eclipse 3.3.2.

Is there any better option for some color support?

Answer 3: 

    
    
Note: Eclipse Luna (4.4, to be released in June 2014) just introduced (May 2014) a default syntax coloring for dark theme when using the Koneki project: see bug 433607, by Simon Bernard:



That illustrates how you can define your own syntax coloring theme and how you can  register an extension to the dark theme for recent (4.x) Eclipse.

Go to "Preferences" under the "Window" menu.

In the dialog that pops up, select General, then Appearance, then Colors and Fonts

Correction: for editor foreground / background colors, you need to go to the preferences dialog, then select Editors, then Text Editors
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
You can also go to your source code, press the right mouse button, select an option under "Appearance color options:" and change the color using the "Color:" selector displayed.
