Title: Visual Studio 2012: &ldquo;Live Error List&rdquo; - how to turn it off?
Description: 
    
    
                    
While I edit C# code in Visual Studio 2012, the "Error List" window continually updates with a list of current syntax errors etc. I find this very distracting and would like to turn it off.

Does anyone know how to turn it off?

(I don't really know what this VS feature is properly called, so someone might already have answered it... Apologies if this is the case.)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I usually unpin it (with the pin icon in its top right corner), and call it up when I want to see it by moving the mouse onto its title. Once you compile your project, the window will automatically come up if there are any errors.

Answer 1: 

    
    
You can do that in Tools / Options and then Environment / Fonts And Colors and there is a setting for background color.

Or even better you can choose from predefined styles at http://studiostyl.es/, these style setting works for Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 for all versions, including the express :

Title: Need Advice on ide choice for Django Development
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been programming with PHP for about 6 years, and wanna start developing on django.

Now I have some questions for you django pros. I've been using PHPDesigner for about a year, because I could never be relieved and code well with eclipse/aptana/similar. I just feel weird with them.

I also have used Komodo Edit and gmate (gedit hack+plugins to make gedit look and work like textmate) on linux.

Of course this question has been answered here before, but most answers were either out of date or were the applications which i'm not feeling comfortable.

So, what IDE would you suggest ? Free solutions would be cool, but price is not a criteria here.

p.s: some documentations / suggestions like "django for noobs" would also be appreciated.

Edit: I'm using Windows 7.

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I suggest you to use PyCharm. It has a great built-in django support, and continuously improved with new features.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Personally, I stick with Netbeans.  It does have support for Python and Django, as well as your other languages (PHP, Java, etc).  It's nice and quick, and is quite configurable.  And it's open source.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
There are lots of good choices.  What you should mostly look for is a good IDE for Python, although support for Django templates has some benefits too.  

Personally I use Eclipse plus PyDev, with a vim plugin.  This way I can keep my favorite editor, and get the benefits of simple code refactoring, instant code navigation (ctrl-click on a method call to jump to its definition) and syntax checking while you type.  IMHO the biggest benefit of an IDE is the ability to interactive debugging - setting breakpoints, line-by-line execution, etc.

Netbeans is also a great choice.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
This is going to quickly dissolve into a which editor is better discussion. The reality is that with django's "testserver"  your choice of editor / ide become less important. The IDE does not have to be tightly bound to the running code with django. We use eclipse w/ pydev here at work almost exclusively. A few developers have jEdit.

Really though, the final answer should be, code with whatever you code best in. 
    
    
Title: Delphi - Where is the IDE picking the list of form names from?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Especially to populate the "inheritable items" and "forms creation" dialogs

I am asking because since a few days, I cannot create inheritable items
anymore as there is a space (or a tab?) appended to each form name so I
end up with an error message when inheriting like 'basewindow 2 is not a
valid identifier' (notice the space between basewindow and 2)

This is very blocking for me as all the forms in the project are inherited from a common ancestor ...

Note: on the newly created froms, there are no space and they work fine. It is a plan d2010 setup, no extra IDE tools or utilities loaded;
Note 2: this relates to one project only

Any idea ?

thanks in advance
Didier
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I have done some investigation into this in relation to the question: Register custom form so I can inherit from it from multiple projects, without copying the form to the Object Repository folder. Although it isn't in my answer there, I have since concluded that the IDE will only let you inherit from items explicitely added to the project.

I would therefore say that it picks up those inheritable items from the dpr file. A line like 

  UnitOKFrame in 'UnitOKFrame.pas' {OKFrame: TFrame},


would add an OKFrame to the inheritable items list.

So my "guess" is that somehow you have gotten extra spaces between the name of your forms/frames and the colon that separates it from its type. Something like:

  UnitOKFrame in 'UnitOKFrame.pas' {OKFrame : TFrame},


If that is indeed the case, I would file a QC report with Embarcadero. They could bother to make the parsing of the dpr a bit more robust and friendly to us poor programmers :-)...



As Uwe mentioned in the comments, forms are included without a type identifier:

  UnitLogonForm in 'UnitLogonForm.pas' {LogonForm},


in this case you might have extra spaces between the curly braces surrounding the actual name:

  UnitLogonForm in 'UnitLogonForm.pas' {LogonForm },

    
    
Title: Pair programming, mixed IDE environments?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Anyone got any experience of teams doing pair programming where there is a mixed IDE environment? I'm a long time IntelliJ user, others use Eclipse, which you may have heard of.

In my mind pair programming involves a lot of passing the keyboard between the programmers. But every time I get the keyboard I grind to a halt as I don't know to do anything anymore. (It's like suddenly I'm an idiot!)

Now I could, probably should, learn my way round Eclipse. (Not starting a holy war here about relative merits.)  But I wonder if anyone else has got an opinion?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I have not done this in a multi-IDE environment.  But pairing is, to my mind, far and away the best way to learn IDE features.  So you should come up to speed quickly on Eclipse, and your colleagues, likewise, should get a handle on IntelliJ in short order.  Both of you will become better versed in both environments - and that's a good position from which to settle on a team IDE, should you choose to do so.

By comparison with other means of learning, pairing teaches you the features that are useful to you (or your pair, who probably has a similar set of needs).  You learn almost by osmosis; as your pair uses a feature you may find yourself asking, "how did you do that?" or "what did you just do?"  This is teaching you the features you need, exactly when you need them.

In your situation, there may be additional value: you may find yourself wanting a feature that your IDE offers; your pair may never have encountered it (but it might be in Eclipse, too).  So you spend a minute tracking down that feature, and now both of you have learned new (and useful) functionality of the IDE.  
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I don't see the need for passing the keyboard around.  In my view, you work on part while the other half of your pair looks over your shoulder.  Sometimes I imagine you would have to take the wheel, but generally not every 10 minutes.  If he types for 4 hours, then you switch places, just switch IDEs at that time.

I agree you should learn the tools that are used, and if there is an actual published or documented standard you should follow it, but if you are allowed to use any IDE you want, then I don't see an issue.  But if it inhibits your ability to deliver, then maybe you pair up with someone using the same IDE as you.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
About 10 years too late for the OP, but this question is still highly ranked in search engines, so others interested in remote mixed environment pair programming can try CodeTogether. It's available for for IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code and IDEs based on them.
Participants join in a browser, but get a full IDE-like experience with IntelliSense, validation, reference searches, navigation, etc. CodeTogether is simple, fast, free, anonymous, and encrypted. The plugins/extensions are in the normal marketplaces/registries you'd expect and are also available on the website.
Full disclosure: I work for Genuitec, the makers of CodeTogether, and we really hope you enjoy it. Any constructive feedback on Gitter or GitHub is always appreciated.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Standardize your environment! As much as you need a common source style, I would argue you also need a common way of working, including having a common IDE. All kinds of settings, knowledge, plugins, etc. is much easier to share, including your example about pair programming.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
In pair programming, the pair should standardize on an IDE.

My suggestion would be either to pair with another IntelliJ user or, if the rest of the group is on Eclipse, start learning Eclipse.

You're going to lose too much time switching between IDEs to gain the efficiencies of pair programming.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
You could have both IDEs loaded on the pairing machine and switch between them as needed, but I'd recommend standardizing IDEs with your pairing partner.  You might want to bring this question up in your next retrospective and see what the team consensus is.

Besides all the options the other posts have already mentioned, I will add DDD. Which is a nice front end for GDB.

I have to say that I have used Eclipse CDT, Netbeans and DDD. None of them come close to what you get with Visual Studio in my opinion. Eclipse and Netbeans, for C/C++ devel are slow and buggy. DDD is ok, but lacks a lot of the features you get with Microsoft tools.

KDevelop has hooks for the GNU tool chain, as well as hooks for valgrind / cachegrind / etc. Its pretty light weight (responsive), rather intuitive and easy to get used to.

I normally just use KATE and open an inline terminal for stuff like valgrind / gdb. With debugging options on, its really easy to step through valgrind's output and fix things line by line in the code.

Both come with KDE, if you have KDE, you should already have these on your menu.

Here's a screenshot of KDevelop (from my desktop). That's a slightly old version, so I'm sure the interface offers more by now.

Can you be a bit more specific with your question?  What exactly is not working?  Can it not find the program, does the compile fail, etc ...

The only immediate issue I can see is that the command line can't resolve the CL command.  Try including the full path to the cl.exe binary.  This is the relevant path on my machine.

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\cl.exe

When using the path environment variable, you must set it to a path, not an application.  Change your path code to 

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin


As for the inability to load mspdb80.dll, I'm worried messing with your environment variables may have contributed to this problem.  Restart your cmd.exe shell and add the line I specified above and retry.  If you still get the error with mspdb80.dll you may need to repair your Visual Studio installation.

Answer 1: 

    
    
There is not a way to do have the cursor end at multiple points. But you can repeat the same variable in multiple places in your template, Then as you edit that variable, it changes in all the locations.

For example, this simple example will create three variables of the same type, the type of which I enter/edit after I expand the template. The actual template is below. You can copy it to your clipboard and then paste it as a template in the Live Template settings dialog. In the example, I used a variable named EDIT.



&lt;template name="meex" value="$EDIT$ a;&amp;#10;$EDIT$ b;&amp;#10;$EDIT$ c;" description="Multiple Edit Example" toReformat="true" toShortenFQNames="true"&gt;
  &lt;variable name="EDIT" expression="" defaultValue="" alwaysStopAt="true" /&gt;

Answer 1: 

    
    
In general: to split current tab in editor:


Right click on editor tab
choose Split Horizontally or Split Vertically
you can also use Move Down or Move Right -- but this will move editor tab into new split instead of "copying" it.


Let's assume you have this setup (notice "test.php" is already located in both splits): 


Now you want to have "css.css" to be in both splits as well. Depends on your IDE version you will have 2 choices: 

1) Split this file -- you will have 3 splits now:


Using mouse move "css.css" from newly created split into existing split:


2) Use Open in Opposite Group action

Answer 1: 

    
    
This isn't really an answer, and so probably shouldn't get upvotes, but has information.

I don't know of any C++ IDE that can do runtime updates of code, but it's definitely not impossible.  There's lots of C++ assemblers which already JIT code, live updates is merely the next step that no IDE has taken quite yet that I know of.
asmjit can JIT C++
Visual Studio can JIT C++/CLI (which isn't quite C++) (RMartinho corrects that VIsual Studio compiles C++/CLI to IL, and then JITs the IL.  Tehcnically different.)
cling uses the clang fruntend and LLVM backend, which has a JIT code generation system.

R.Martinho has also reminded me that Microsoft Visual Studio already has this feature.  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/esaeyddf(v=vs.100).aspx  If you "stop" the code, you can make changes, and it will apply those changes and resume execution.

Answer 3: 

    
    
You can't run C++ code without compiling. Minor syntactic differences between languages shouldn't be an issue so you shouldn't limit yourself to just one language.

I suggest you give Unity a chance; there's a fairly robust free version available. You can write scripts in C# (a language similar to C++), or UnityScript (somehting similar to JavaScript) or Boo (similar to Python) and you can test the results right away, without having to compile.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
What about Edit and Continue in Visual Studio? In order to use it, you have to pause execution (either by breakpoint or Pause button), recompile and resume. Note, that you can edit the code while the program is running. I know you can't test the game live, but you don't have to reload resources etc. It's IDE integration makes it really easy and straightforward to use.

If you want changes to be visible live, though, consider using script language such as Lua. One of their purposes is what you want to achieve.

Organize your C++ game to use plugins, and add a feature to load a new (binary version of) plugin during the game.

Then, you could play your game, recompile a plugin, reload it (so invoke your dynamic linker at runtime), and continue playing.

It is not failproof, but it might usually work.

Of course you cannot unload a plugin which has some active call frame on the (or some thread's) call stack. I would suggest to avoid unloading old plugins...

Description: 
    
    
                    
NOTE

This was flagged as a potentially subjective question, but it is not subjective. It is requested to learn the various specific ways that people use Vim so that a person coming from a "mouse-and-keyboard" oriented text editor might learn more of the Vim way of editing.

This is not a subjective question about personal preferences or which editor or editing style is best.

This is a specific question about the mechanical steps one would take to obtain an outcome in the Vim editor, using alternative editors as a baseline for cross-reference.

PROBLEM

Suppose you have the following code in your Vim and you want to get from before to after where before looks like this:

// Before //

$mynames    = Array();
$mynames['alice'] = 'alpha';


... and after looks like this ...

// After //

$mynames    = Array();
$mynames['alice'] = 'alpha';
$mynames['betty'] = 'bravo';
$mynames['cindy'] = 'charlie';
$mynames['deana'] = 'delta';


HOW NON-VIM EDITORS WOULD DO IT

Using a non-vim editor, programmer A would simply copy the first line for alice, paste it multiple times into the editor and then re-edit the values so that alice and alpha are replaced with the appropriate values, editing one line at a time.

Using a non-vim editor, programmer B would create a rectangular selection that spans four lines, and just start typing the common text $mynames[''] = ''; and then go back and fill in the appropriate values, editing one line at a time.

HOW ABOUT VIM?

Given that Vim is a significantly different approach from "mouse-and-keyboard" style editors of the day, this is a request for insight on the specific steps one takes in editing with Vim. Obviously, it is possible to just type each line individually, but it is assumed that there is a time-saving way to do this in Vim in a way that compares to what programmer A and programmer B did above.

1) How would a vim programmer go about doing this edit operation, using a time-saving method like those above?

2) If someone were to search the Internet for more examples of specific 'step-by-step' comparisons of Vim editing sessions vs "mouse-and-keyboard" style editing, what would one search for?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I use the same, first i copy a line. then pasting it any times what i need.

Then you can create a macro to edit a keys. When cursor is on first line where i need to work. (a frist pasted line)

    qq f[ci'&lt;C&gt;-&lt;o&gt;q  "recordes a macro to find a [block] and 
change inner quotes ' and stays in insert mode


Then you can play your macro any time by @q . (I have a map Q = @q for fast macro start by Shift+q)
The same way you can use for values: 

 qq f=f'ci'&lt;C&gt;-&lt;o&gt;q


Macro for find a value block and go to insert mode. 

And the answer for comparsion i will save time to move my hand from keyboard to mouse times = number of edit lines. Selecting a block for changing. Vim is more productive no doubt.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If I know ahead of time what the different values are going to be, I'll to the roundabout approach. I'll start with this:

$mynames    = Array();
alice alpha
betty bravo 
cindy charlie
deana delta


Then I will place my cursor in front of alice, hit Ctrl+V, move down to deana, then hit Shift+I to go into insert mode and type $mynames[' followed by Esc. This inserts the text in all selected lines. Then I repeat that for '] = ', followed finally by ';'

Not the most efficient way, but usually the first that comes to mind.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I like AlexRus's solution (I love Vim macros).

But I think that a more realistic situation would be to paste the key/value pairs from some other application/document:

betty bravo
cindy charlie
deana delta


and perform a bunch of transformations on each line.

SOLUTION 1

We could select all three lines with &lt;S-v&gt;jj or some other way and apply a series of search/replace on the selection:

:'&lt;,'&gt;s/^/$mynames['
gv to reselect
:'&lt;,'&gt;s/ /'] = '
gv to reselect
:'&lt;,'&gt;s/$/';


The whole editing sequence looks like this:

&lt;S-v&gt;jj:s/^/$mynames['&lt;CR&gt;gv:s/ /'] = '&lt;CR&gt;gv:s/$/';&lt;CR&gt;


SOLUTION 2

We could apply a single search/replace

:'&lt;,'&gt;s/^\(.*\) \(.*\)$/$myname['\1'] = '\2';


where the search part isolates the beginning of the line (^), the space between words () and the end of the line ($) by actually matching the text between them and the replace part replaces the whole line with $myname[' + the first match (\1) + '] = ' + the second match (\2) + ';.

I'm bad at regex so I had to check my notes to put it together but I have no doubt many Vim users are able to type that kind of command in one go. I will, someday.

The whole editing sequence looks like this:

&lt;S-v&gt;jj:s/^\(.*\) \(.*\)$/$myname['\1'] = '\2';&lt;CR&gt;


SOLUTION 3

With the same setup, we could enter VISUAL-BLOCK mode at the beginning of the first line with &lt;C-v&gt;, go as far down as necessary and type I$myaccess['&lt;Esc&gt; to obtain:

$mynames['betty bravo
$mynames['cindy charlie
$mynames['deana delta


move the cursor to the space between words with f&lt;Space&gt;, hit &lt;C-v&gt; again, expand the selection to the bottom and type c'] = '&lt;Esc&gt; to obtain:

$mynames['betty'] = 'bravo
$mynames['cindy'] = 'charlie
$mynames['deana'] = 'delta


then move to the end of the line with $, hit &lt;C-v&gt; again, select what you want again and type A';&lt;Esc&gt; for the last touch.

The whole editing sequence looks like this: 

&lt;C-v&gt;jjI$myaccess['&lt;Esc&gt;f &lt;C-v&gt;jjc'] = '&lt;Esc&gt;$&lt;C-v&gt;jjA';&lt;Esc&gt;

I've been doing web development in Coda recently. It's a really fantastic app, however there are some very annoying quirks. When going through a list of 5 or 6 closing divs I'm trying to find the quickest way to match up the closing tag with it's partner.

This is one feature Coda does not support. Other IDEs have had it forever, Dreamweaver comes to mind first. You can request the feature by emailing the guys over at Panic. They are VERY responsive to user requests in future updates. Their address is coda@panic.com.

Otherwise, you can quickly copy paste the text over to TextWrangler (which does support the feature) and make sure all the tags are in order before uploading. I use it as my main HTML/PHP IDE. It's great for webdevs.

Nothing special is needed.  Just write your code in a .c source code file instead of a .cpp file.  The project templates create .cpp files, just rename them with right-click + Rename.

Just give your files names with .c extension, an they will be compiled as C. Alternatively, you can specify that a particular file should be compiled as C (regardless of the file name extension) in the project settings. Nothing else needs to be done.

Note though that one annoyance of this IDE is that its syntax highlighting (and some other) features are tailored for C++. It will highlight C++-specific keywords in C code, which is rather annoying. Features like IntelliSense also fail to work properly with C++ -specific keywords in C code.

Sybase Workspace is a new tool for ASE, I've never tried it. http://www.sybase.com/products/modelingdevelopment/workspace

ASE ISQL is a free tool that is also useful for running sql, but is less useful for modifiying stored procedures etc. (More of a SQL Advantage replacement). http://code.google.com/p/aseisql/

If you have money to spend then there's also Embarcadero's DBArtisan. http://www.embarcadero.com/products/dbartisan. I've used this and it's pretty good, although their support for MSSQL and Oracle is better than the Sybase support.

If, SCSI, does it matter whether you use an BusLogic or LSILogic?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Go for the SCSI and LSILogic. IDE and BusLogic are for compatibility reasons. Like when you do physical2virtual...

There's a whitepaper from vmware showing the difference between LSILogic and BusLogic, which in my opinion is rather small:
http://www.vmware.com/pdf/ESX2_Storage_Performance.pdf

Edit after like three years:
With current ESX environments it's best to use the Paravirtual SCSI device.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I don't think that your choice of Virtual Disk type in VMWare matters for performance. What matters is the following: How much memory you have (the more the better), How many CPU cores you have (the more the better), and more specifically about disks, what matters most is the speed of the physical drive (a 15K RPM SCSI drive being best). If you have, for example, 3 physical HDs and 3 virtual HDs, then I would place one virtual HD in each physical HD. This is known to improve virtual HD performance. Also keep your virtual HDs defragmented.
    
    
Title: Can you really build a fast word processor with GoF Design Patterns?
Description: 
    
    
                    
The Gang of Four's Design Patterns uses a word processor as an example for at least a few of their patterns, particularly Composite and Flyweight.

Other than by using C or C++, could you really use those patterns and the object-oriented overhead they entail to write a high-performing fully featured word processor? 

I know that Eclipse is written in Java but I haven't used it much so I don't know if it's all that fast or as polished as something like Visual Studio, which has a C++ based text editing system.



I only used C++ and Java as examples. The question has more to do with the overhead of having a lot of in-memory objects like you would in an application such as a word processor or even a game. 

Design patterns promote abstraction at the expense of parsimony even though they usually point out when you might take some kind of performance hit. Word processors and especially games get the most benefit from being as close to the metal as possible. 

I was just wondering if anyone knew of an fast object-oriented word processor or text editor that wasn't written in C++, and whether they'd build one using patterns or would they forgoe a lot of the abstracting away of things?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Flyweight really is just a way of conserving resources in situations where there are thousands of objects with intrinsic shared state, so it could be useful in higher level languages than C/C++. Maybe the GoF's example using glyphs in a document was not the best choice to illustrate this pattern.

I think there's a lot more to building a high performance word processor than just these basic patterns though - not sure whether there is anything in GoF that rules out being able to successfully do this.

Generally, Visual Studio (VS) is more advanced and performs significantly better than Eclipse - at least, the versions of VS that I have seen. Eclipse is one of the most impressive Java applications out there though, it runs quite well on more recent machines with lots of RAM.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Well, flyweight is a ridiculous pattern to use in a word processor.  IIRC, they had each character being referenced as a object [note: it was for each glyph, which is still crazy because your OS will happily draw that for you].  With a pointer being wider than a character and all the processing associated with indirection, you'd be mad to use that particular pattern that way in a word processor.

If you're interested in the design of word processors, I found an article that doesn't address patterns but does look at some of the data structures underlying word processor design and design considerations.

Try to remember that design patterns are there to make your life easier, not for you to be pure.  There has to be a reason to use a pattern, it has to offer some benefit.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The point of GoF and patterns in general is to talk about how to do things "right" as in correct, not necessarily "right" as in right for the circumstances. Where performance is an issue, and you find that no named pattern gives adequate performance, then perhaps you can justify going your own way. But a good knowledge of patterns gives you a "sensible default" and will probably mean that you sacrifice clarity / SoC / etc only so much as is necessary to give adequate performance.

Feeling that you are "deviating" from the norm encourages you to a) think twice, and b) comment the non-idiomatic code well.

Patterns are vital knowledge, but nothing is gospel and you must always apply judgement.

Having said all that - I can't think of any reason why you couldn't write a decent text editor using patterns and a modern JDK
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    

  One of the things you have to remember was that the GoF book was written in the early 90s, when the prevalent OSes did not have extensive graphic libraries. Even Windows was not yet an OS at that time.


IIRC GoF was released in 1994. Even in 1994 Windows 95 Beta was available (and running on my 486DX33) and Windows 3.x had been around since roughly 1990.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Eclipse + netbeans + IntelliJ all are written pretty much all in java or something that runs on the JVM (not C++). In at least 2 of those IDEs I have spent some time with the editor code, so I can assure you its all java (and its not easy either). 

VS 2005 was my last experience of visual studio, and even then I thought eclipse was much more responsive (intelliJ doubly so given time to warm up and index). 

Not sure how thats relevant but thats my experience. But I am surprised visual studio is still today written in C++ - I would think that it would be in Microsoft's interest to use C# - if nothing else it would really push its performance hard, nothing like eating your own dog food !
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Yes, current machines are fast enough and have enough memory that that is possible. If you take a look at Squeak, you see a Smalltalk IDE written in Smalltalk, significantly slower than Java, but still fast enough. HD video editing on the other hand is something that currently has a need for some lower-level support.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
This question actually seems to be about Java vs. C++ performance, and that's not the object orientation so much as running on a virtual machine with garbage collection and such.

This whitepaper on Java vs. C++ performance might be worth a read.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Hi all. I'm very new with Go and Gogland. I have a project



I choose "Run kind" as Package - to run not only main file but a project. Why it cannot find main package??
How to import util.myprinter package to main.go to use it??


Please, help me
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
First, the general structure of your Go workspace seems to be wrong. You need to make it look more like this:

D:
|-- go_projects
|    |-- bin
|    |-- pkg
|    |-- src 
|    |    |-- FirstSteps
|    |    |    |-- main.go
|    |    |    +-- util
|    |    |         +-- myprinter.go
|    |    |-- SecondProject
|    |    |-- ThirdProject
...


Second your import statement seems to be empty, I have no idea how goglang works but if you want to use whatever is in your myprinter.go file, you will need to import the util package, assuming that the myprinter.go file declares its package as util at the top.

// FirstSteps/main.go
package main

import (
    "FirstSteps/util"
)

func main() {
    util.MyPrinterFunc()
}


And of course to be able to use anything from util there first must be something...

// FirstSteps/util/myprinter.go
package util

func MyPrinterFunc() {
    // do stuff...
}


Edit: I'm sorry, I didn't actually answer your question initially. You're getting the error Cannot find package 'main' because of the wrong workspace setup I already mentioned. The Package path tells Gogland where the package you want to run is relative to the $GOPATH/src directory. So after you've setup your wrokspace correctly, you should set the Package path to FirstSteps since that package's absolute path will be $GOPATH/src/FirstSteps. If, later, you want to run the util package you would specify Package path as FirstSteps/util for gogland to be able to find it.

I'm testing on Delphi 2007 and my groupproject is composed by 2 packages.



PackageRun.bpl

It's marked as "runtime only" and contains a unit named "uMyTestRun.pas" in which is defined an empty TFrame descendant:

unit uMyTestRun;

interface

uses
  Windows, Messages, SysUtils, Variants, Classes, Graphics, Controls, Forms, 
  Dialogs;

type
  TMyTest = class(TFrame)
  private
    { Private declarations }
  public
    { Public declarations }
  end;

implementation

{$R *.dfm}

end.


PackageDes.bpl

It requires PackageRun.bpl, it's marked as "designtime only" and contains a unit named "uMyTestDes.pas" in which I wrote the following code:

unit uMyTestDes;

interface

uses
  Classes,
  uMyTestRun;

procedure Register;

implementation

procedure Register;
begin
  RegisterComponents('MyComponents', [TMyTest]);
end;

end.


Output directories of both packages are in Library paths (Inside there are bpl, dcp and dcu).



Trying to install PackageDes.bpl (Component, Install Packages..., Add...), I'm getting the following error:


  Can't load package C:\&lt;.../p/blockquotep/pp
Answer 1: 

    
    
Run Process Monitor from http://SysInternals.com and set the filters to intercept only file operations ( toolbar rightmost buttons ) of your Delphi IDE process (check the process name in TaskManager or shortcut properties (it is bds.exe for Delphi XE2), then add the filter similar to Include / Process Name / Ends With / bds.exe ). 

Then clear the log in PM, switch to Delphi and try to load the package, then as soon as error pops up switch back to PM and stop capturing events. Try to do it fast as you can, for example do not waste your time closing error box. 

Now you would get a trace of file I/O activity of Delphi loading the package of yours (and some other background activity noise - the faster you do the less noise there'd be). In that trace look for all the errors and see where and which package Delphi tries to find. 

You can also try Microsoft Dependency Walker or similar tools to se if your Design-Time BPL has all the DLL-dependency tree resolvable. Personally I usually use Unreal/Total commander with FileInfo plugin or ntCore CFF Explorer.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Easy way to solve this issue is to add a post build action to your run time project:

copy "$(OUTPUTDIR)\$(OUTPUTFILENAME)" "$(BDSCOMMONDIR)\Bpl"


The command above copies your run time file to the default IDE Bpl location.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I had a similar issue. In my case I had the same library name in a different Delphi version BPL path. I found out the solution for my issue looking at the comments above, so this is only a reminder for basic things to check:


BPL path have to be included in your OS path variable;
Search for a BPL module with the same name in other OS path before the right one (mutiple Delphi version installations).

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Try to change the register procedure to uMyTestRun unit.

unit UMyTestRun;

interface

uses
  Windows, Messages, SysUtils, Variants, Classes, Graphics, Controls, Forms, Dialogs;

type
  TMyTest = class(TFrame)
  private
    { Private declarations }
  public
    { Public declarations }
  end;

procedure Register;

implementation

procedure Register;
begin
  RegisterComponents('MyComponents', [TMyTest]);
end;
end.


Now, the package will install correctly.

Title: Qt Creator - Code is running but I get an error message from the IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
As soon as I run my code (note that I'm using C only, no QT and no C++) I get the following message from the application output inside the IDE:


  Cannot obtain a handle to the inferior: The parameter is incorrect.


When I delete the makefiles and debug/release folders it's running but after some time I still get the error. It's not that much of a problem though, the code runs and everything is fine but this error pops up and it's quite annoying.

The content of the .pro file is:

TEMPLATE = app
CONFIG += console
CONFIG -= app_bundle
CONFIG -= qt
QMAKE_CC = gcc -std=c99
SOURCES += main.c


Thanks in advance!



edit: I have added C++ tag, because this error occurs also for C++ console application as in my case.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I have met same problem. Tips and advices on forums are rather clueless, so I investigated problem myself and I have found that it's a bug in QtCreator.

There is dirty little program called qtcreator_process_stub. Whenever you run your program within IDE, IDE first runs qtcreator_process_stub and passes your program name as parameter (among some other parameters). qtcreator_process_stub then starts your program as separate process and prints its PID (and on windows also thread id). Information is printed to the pipe and then it is read by ConsoleProcess::readStubOutput(), which is part of Utils.dll library used by QtCreator. 

The problem occurs when "inferior" process (your application) finishes execution before whole communication has been processed. ConsoleProcess::readStubOutput() attempts to use OpenProcess() on non-existing process with closed handle. OpenProcess() fails hence error "Cannot obtain a handle to the inferior: The parameter is incorrect.". Whole error is not handled very gently (Uhm, and now what?)... :-/

Solution:
When you add some user input action, pause, sleep, delay or just some loops, so that execution of your application is a bit longer error vanishes. There is enough time for ConsoleProcess::readStubOutput() to execute OpenProcess(), before your application quits. So as a workaroud I suggest to do that until the bug is fixed.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I got the same error repeatedly while working on a C++ project in Qt. I was able to solve it by copying one of the shared libraries(.dll) I was using in to the build folder. 

So, if you are using any shared external libraries that are needed at runtime, make sure they are in the builds folder.
    
    
Title: Miscellaneous confusion about Xcode build settings (64/32 bits, SDK version, etc)
Description: 
    
    
                    
When I create a new OS X application project, I noticed many target options those confuse me quite a lot:



(1) The top-left setting of Xcode window:




(2) The "Base SDK":




(3) "Deployment Target": 




(4) Architectures:




Here comes my questions:

For (2) and (3), I think it was clearer to understand. These are what I comprehend:
(2) This identifies what I develop with.
(3) This identifies what OS version my application will be used on.
Please tell me whether I am right...

But I could not understand (1). I just know that if I select 32-bit here, I could not use ARC.

Neither with (4), what are they? Are they represent the bit-width of the CPU? What was the difference between (1) and (4)?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'll explain your items out of order.

The Base SDK

This defines the largest set of APIs you can use. You can use anything that existed as of the version number identified here. For example, if you use the 10.8 SDK, you can use -[NSColor CGColor] (introduced in 10.8), but not -[NSData base64EncodedDataWithOptions:] (first public in 10.9).

(Of course, you can also use anything older than that version.)

Accordingly, the SDK version is also known as the “max[imum] allowed” version in the Availability macros.

The SDK version also sometimes becomes important when Apple changes the behavior of an API. When they do that, they sometimes keep the old behavior around for applications linked with older SDKs. This is called an “on-or-after check”, as in “checks whether you're on 10.8 [SDK] or later”. (The concept and term pre-date Xcode having SDKs for each OS version. It used to just go by whatever OS you were running Xcode and building on.)

The Deployment Target

This is the minimum OS version you require. If something was removed in a prior version (rare, but it happens), you can't use it.

This tends to affect link-time and run-time things more than compile-time things. For example, ARC won't work if your deployment target is 10.5 or earlier.

Accordingly, the Deployment Target is also known as the “min[imum] required” version in the Availability macros.

The Info.plist can also specify a minimum OS version. Nowadays, this is set by default and it's set by macro expansion to the Deployment Target.

The Architectures build setting

Different CPUs have different architectures. Essentially, they fit into broad categories, such as:


PowerPC 32-bit (ppc)
PowerPC 64-bit (ppc64)
Intel 32-bit (i386)
Intel 64-bit (x86_64)
ARM 32-bit
ARM 64-bit


(PowerPC architectures aren't supported anymore. You can add them to the Architectures list, as ppc and ppc64, but Xcode will just ignore them.)

Macs nowadays have Intel processors. Almost all Intel Macs have 64-bit processors. You only need to worry about 32-bit Intel if you want to support Macs all the way back to 2006. That's probably more hassle than it's worth.

iOS devices run ARM processors, and most are still 32-bit. The A7 (iPhone 5S, iPad Air, iPad Mini with Retina Display) is 64-bit. But, if you run on an iOS Simulator, it's running on your Mac (it's a Simulator, not an emulator), so it'll target an Intel architecture (formerly always i386, but probably can now be x86_64 if needed).

The “top-left setting of Xcode window”

This is the build scheme and run destination. (Yes, it's two separate things in one pop-up menu. Actually, it's two separate pop-up menus in one control. Try it.)

“My Mac 64-bit” is the run destination. You'll be running the 64-bit version of your app on your Mac, not in an iOS Simulator or on an iOS device. Your choice for a Mac app is merely which architecture you want to run, and they should behave the same (this is, obviously, something you sometimes need to test).

iOS apps have more choices here. Some apps are iPhone-only, some are iPad-only, some are universal, and some may be set to build for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. You'll have a Simulator offered for each combination of form factor and architecture (e.g., iPhone Simulator 64-bit) you can run on. You'll also have the option to run your app on any iOS device that's connected and enabled for development (you get this prompt when you plug in the device in Xcode's sight).

TL;DR


Deployment Target is the lowest OS version your app will run on.
Base SDK is the highest OS version you can use stuff from. If it didn't exist yet, it doesn't exist at all for you.
Architectures are the set of hardware your app will run on.
Run Destination is the hardware you're going to run it on from within Xcode.

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Just like with most OSes these days you can develop either a 32bit or a 64bit application. The "bitness" refers mostly to how memory addresses are structured (either using 32bit allowing so at most 4GB to address or 64bit (computation left as an exercise to the reader)). However the choosen architecture usually has more implications (like the missing ARC support for 32bit apps) but also how wide CPU registers are, how much memory a structure uses in RAM etc.

OS X also supports socalled fat binaryies that is, a bundle containing both 32bit and 64bit variants of your application. This is however only needed if you normally prefer to run 64bit code, but want your app also to run on OS versions that only support 32bit.

In XCode you can define for what architecture to build your project, either 32bit only, 64bit only or a fat bundle. In the project settings you can set what is allowed and in the top bar in XCode you can quickly switch between the allowed architectures (your questions 1 and 4).

The base SDK determines what you want to use to compile your application. If you select for instance 10.7 you cannot use new APIs that were introduced in 10.8 or 10.9 (which might perfectly be ok if you want your application to run on earlier OS versions only). However if you want to dynamically use new features if they are availble you'd select the latest OS as base SDK and check in code what OS you are running on and only use new features if they are available. It is totally ok to compile an application with access to new features and run it on older systems if you don't use the new APIs there (they are late-bound and hence only crash when you access them the first time and they are not available).

The deployment target determines the minimum OS version your application needs to run properly. This is a runtime check done when the application is started. The OS will refuse to start an application that is made for a later version.
    
    
Title: Jump to method definition regardless of class it is defined in
Description: 
    
    
                    
In the MatlabⓇ IDE, is there any easy way to jump to the definition of a particular method, without knowing in what class it is defined?

For self-contained functions, I can type edit funcname.m.  The same for classes.  However, the hierarchy of superclasses for a particular class may be large.  By using metaclasses, I can find out in what class a method was defined, then open the class, and browse to the appropiate definition.  This is a lot more work than it is for self-contained functions.

From the interactive prompt, is there any direct way to either jump to the definition of a particular method, or put a breakpoint in this method (so that executing it will cause the editor to jump to the definition)?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Actually in MATLAB's IDE you can move between functions within a file.
If you want to get more information about a function that you are calling in your code, you can use Open Selection (CTRL+D with Windows keybindings) to quickly jump to where the function is defined.

Check this link: MATLAB Spoken Here

if you move the cursor on a function in the editor and then press ctrl+D the function will be open in the editor. for methods inside a class you can use 'Go To'.  If the method is defined in the present class.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can use which to locate a function when given specific input arguments.

Say for example we have the following files on the path:

&gt;&gt; which -all fun
C:\Users\Amro\Desktop\fun.m
C:\Users\Amro\Desktop\Klass.m    % Klass method


Klass.m

classdef Klass &lt; handle
    methods
        function fun(obj)
            disp('hello from Klass')
        end
    end
end


fun.m

function fun()
    disp('hello from fun')
end


Now we can differentiate between the two given what arguments they take:

&gt;&gt; o = Klass();
&gt;&gt; which('fun(o)')
C:\Users\Amro\Desktop\Klass.m  % Klass method

&gt;&gt; which('fun')
C:\Users\Amro\Desktop\fun.m


Note that in the class method case, we have to use the syntax: fun(obj, args, ...) as opposed to obj.fun(args, ...)

You can open the editor to the specified function using the matlab.desktop.editor API:

matlab.desktop.editor.openAndGoToFunction(which('Klass'),'fun');

    
    
Title: Selenium IDE for Firefox Ctrl-Tab
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm attempting to automate some settings in multiple forms from a list that I open  into their own tabs. 
The easiest way that I can prep the pages prior to running the script is to have them all open .
I intend to have selenium run through the changes to the form, then I want it to Ctrl+Tab to the next one. I will use a loop while to set the count.
I currently have it recording in HTML, if I need to adjust it over to java or I will gladly do so.

I've attempted to record it, but no go.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There's no support for tabs in Selenium as of now. A fairly recent answer by one of the Selenium developers explains it pretty clearly:


  Selenium has no ability to switch tabs at the moment. Because of this
  we force the browser to open links in new windows but since we are
  able to switch windows we force the browser to take the approach. This
  may be fixed in a later version.


Also, if you get away from IDE (or export your testcase to WebDriver) and get to a more powerful tool (any full-strength programming language binding for Selenium), you might use some kind of workaround:

https://stackoverflow.com/a/12730918/1273080 (Taps Ctrl+2 to get to the second tab etc.) However, this kind of workarounds is usually limited to a certain browser/OS/browser setting (tabs can be disabled).



That said, if you don't insist on using tabs and would use several browser windows instead, that's fairly easy in IDE as well as Selenium RC and WebDriver:

Selenium IDE: selectWindow (you can spawn a new window by openWindow)

Selenium RC: selectWindow()

Selenium WebDriver: switchTo().window()

Description: 
    
    
                    
Is it possible to compile a Delphi5 project in the new XE IDE without any migration?

If've been using Delphi5 IDE for quite a while now and, to be honest, it is old, unfriendly and unflexible. I tried out XE and was impressed, however I am not interested in migrating projects to newer versions of Delphi.

So, is it possible? And if not, are there other IDEs that support Delphi5 in that matter?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Unfortunately it's not - Delphi XE is unicode-only. And there are no other IDEs. As for Delphi 5 - that was a great version and we widely use it until now. Try looking for some add-ons and experts for Delphi 5 that make development more comfortable. CodeRush, ModelMaker Explorer are commercial ones, and there were some free addons. Personally I use ModelMaker Explorer for Delphi 5, which I purchased years ago. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
In our case it took around 4-5 weeks to migrate our project from D7 to D2010. There are some good links where you can see what kind of code should be modified and think if it worth it in your case, the main difference is the Unicode-issue.

For example, any code that manipulates or does pointer operations on strings should be examined for Unicode compatibility. More specifically, any code that:


Assumes that SizeOf(Char) is 1
Assumes that the Length of a string is equal to the number of bytes in
the string 
Writes or reads strings from some persistent storage or uses a string
as a data buffer


Take a look at the complete article from Embarcadero
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If you buy XE, you're entitled to older versions of the IDE as well (back to D7, IIRC). Delphi 2007 is almost as good an IDE as XE, and it will compile D5 code as long as you have the source with only minor changes. (Typically, having to add Variants to the uses clause is the major issue.)
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Andreas Hausladen has a Delphi plugin that offers this sort of functionality (compile in an IDE using a different version of dcc32 than native to that IDE).  It's called IDE Compiler Plugin.

However, it's only available Delphi 2007 and 2009.  To be frank I think you are better keeping both versions of Delphi installed side by side.

Title: Compiling C code in Windows XP
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have C code that was compiled on Windows NT with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0. I am migrating this code to a new machine using Windows XP. What IDE is suitable for this? I don't think MS Visual 6.0 has been designed for XP... Can I just use Visual Studio C++ to compile C code and keep the same functionality?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can still use Visual Studio 6 with Windows XP.

You could also download Visual Studio C++ Express 

Downloading and installing MinGW could be an option as well as long as the C is compatible.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
From your wording, I'm guessing you already have a later version of Visual Studio than VC6, so yes - you should be able to open any project/solution and proceed, with a couple of caveats:


Make sure to do this to a copy of your project (probably a copy of the whole source tree, actually), as VS will prompt you to make a 1-way conversion of the old VC6 project to the new format.  Once this is done, you can't open it again in VC6.
You may find compile or link errors when you try to build the project.  Most likely these will be due to changes in the C++ language or libraries used between the two versions, but if the code was reasonably well crafted, this shouldn't be too hard to fix.


But, as others have said, yes - VC6 still works fine on XP.  The only drawback is you may not be able to get access to newer C++ language features, or Windows SDK features directly.

Best of luck!
    
    
Answer 3:

MSVC++ 2008 Express may be the answer; however this free version of VC++ does not support MFC out of the box; you may be able to get it to work with MFC libraries from VC++ 6 (but not the 'visual' design tools).  It will however build Win32 API code, and can be used for .NET/Windows Forms applications with 'visual' development capabilities.

If you need MFC, then you may be better off sticking with v6.0 which works in XP (get the latest service pack), or a paid-for edition of Visual Studio.

Are there any other IDEs worth my time for Lotus Notes development? We're doing mostly LotusScript development and would kill for features of Eclipse or Visual Studio, like "Show Declaration". I know there's an Eclipse plugin for Java development in Notes, but seems like it only does Java, and we have too many pieces of legacy code in LotusScript to abandon it.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Lotus Notes has moved to the Eclipse platform in version 8. You can run the client in 2 different modes, basic mode which is the version we all know or on the Eclipse platform (know as the standard). The IDE is also moving to eclipse, version 8.5 beta 2 is currently available with the new Eclipse based IDE. Bear in mind that it's a Beta version and it's not feature complete.

Time is on our side.

The Domino Designer based on Eclipse is now a free download from http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ls/dominodesigner/learn.html

It has brilliant Java and LotusScript editors with all the nice Eclipse features like refactoring and typeahead of custom classes.

Every Domino addict should look at this.  Admins too, as the above download includes the admin client.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
As of version 8.5 Domino Designer is run as an Eclipse application. 8.5.1 will bring a whole ton of improvements including Eclipse based LotusScript and Java editing as well as improvements to performance, stability and XPages.

No support for keyboard shortcuts.
Not completely integrated into the designer so is a bit sluggish.

You could give the Zeus IDE a test drive. It is highly and language neutral so it might be possible to configure it for Lotus Notes. 

Zeus automatically maintains a tags database based on the information produced by ctags, so provided ctags generates tags information for Lotus Notes it will be able display, browser and search this tags information.

PS: If decide give it a test drive and find it does not support Notes correctly, feel free to post a bug report to the Zeus forum.

Download an older version of IntelliJ. They have other versions available. Read the release notes and find the one that suits your requirements. The 2017 release should work.

To be completely honest, support for Windows 7 has almost completely faded out on all applications, since it is now considered obsolete. Check if Eclipse/BlueJ satisfies your requirements. You might also want to try deleting all the IntelliJ software and restarting your computer, then go through the download process carefully.

BlueJ v 4.1.4 supports 32-bit systems. Most IDEs now work with Java 11 and beyond, and Java 11 itself requires 64-bit systems. As the BlueJ website states, over 95% of users have a 64-bit system now, so 32-bit is a waste of development resources.

Eclipse's concepts of "workspace" and "project" are matched by IntelliJ IDEA's "project" and "module" respectively. So to achieve similar setup as in your screenshot, create an ampty project, and import the modules "core", "model". .. to it.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a way to have 2 windows of files/projects open in netbeans? I want to have one of these windows pointed at one folder, and the other window pointed at another folder. When you have a lot of files and have to constantly switch between the two folders, it gets annoying to have to scroll that much each time.

No exist solutions. But you can "hack" like this: https://pandazen.wordpress.com/2009/12/23/open-netbeans-with-two-instances-windows-simultaneously/
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The instructions provided in opening-multiple-netbeans-ide-instances actually works.

I have tested it and working as expected. You need to create shortcut for tow different directories with providing project directory.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Two open two instances of Netbeans, I double click on two program files in quick succession before Netbeans can fire itself up. 
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Allow me to explicitly add in here the "hack" mentioned by @Do_Nhu_Vy  (since I don't trust third party websites, and I don't have enough reputation to reply to his comment). All credit goes to the original WordPress user (Pandazen) in said link.

Now then,

the hack/solution consists of changing the "userdir" of NetBeans at launch time: when NetBeans detects a different "userdir" (than the already opened Netbeans' window) it will then proceed to open a new window.

The process of changing NetBeans' userdir at launch is simple:


Create an empty user directory, for example: C:\tmp
Duplicate your already existing NetBeans shortcut (create a new one). You'll most likely find the shortcut in the "Start Menu" Windows directory C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\NetBeans"
Right click the newly created Netbeans shortcut and choose "Properties",
Modify the "Target" field by adding the --userdir DIRECTORY suffix with the chosen path, replacing DIRECTORY with your newly created empty directory. For example: "C:\Program Files\NetBeans 8.2\bin\netbeans64.exe"" --userdir C:\tmp


Now, every shortcut will launch a NetBeans instance in a different window. This works with NetBeans 8.2, but I haven't tested it with NetBeans 9 or 10.
    
    
Title: Visual Studio 2010 html indenting
Description: 
    
    
                    
In visual studio, when I paste an html snippet into the source window of an aspx/ascx file the IDE re-indents the contents. For instance, if I paste this ...

&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Item 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="#"&gt;Item 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Item 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;/div&gt;


.. the ide will reformat the text to ....

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Item 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Item 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
            href="#"&gt;Item 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

But really, I want the html formatted like this ...

&lt;div&gt;

            &lt;a href="#"&gt;Item 1&lt;/a&gt;

Title: IDE Conditional Block Highlighting
Description: 
    
    
                    
SETUP:

Imagine I have a pretty good size program, and #defines and various means of including/excluding various pieces of code are in use.

I.E. Suppose I have a piece of code like this

example_file.c:

include &lt;definition_file&gt;

#ifdef THIS
  do something really cool here
#ifdef THAT
  do something even cooler
#endif
#endif


definition_file.c:

#define THAT TRUE
#define THIS FALSE


Right now I don't know that neither statement will be included or used unless I look in definition. The above is a simple example, but suppose you have say 50 ifdefs and they're nested in varying ways, tracking down what each of the 50 values are is kinda a pain in the butt.

QUESTION:

Does a program/environment exist that would for example gray out or highlight the entire piece of code indicating that based on your "control file" they won't be included or will be included. (some sort of visual or other indication)

NOTE:
If someone can improve the name or the question please by all means, I'm really at a loss what to call this. (or suggest better tags too)

Visual Studio 2010 will do this for both C++ (with various degrees of success) and C# (100% reliable).

I think you need to make sure that the path mappings are correctly entered in the "Mappings" tab of your deployment configuration. 
If the mappings tab is not correctly filled out, a warning will be shown in that tab (e.g. "Deployment path is not specified").

The upload/compare/download menu entries for the deployment configuration will be greyed out as long as the mappings are not defined.

I had the same problem and it was resolved by entering the correct path mappings.
