Where can I get the Groovy bundle for TextMate? I checked the TextMate subversion repository but it's not there. The Groovy site TextMate page references TextMate's missing Groovy bundle.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
After a bit more searching it looks like the Groovy bundle moved to github. There's also a Grails bundle as well.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The bundle has moved to github. See http://groovy.codehaus.org/TextMate for install instructions.

The best way to find and install bundles on Textmate is using GetBundles. Place the tmbundle in the ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles

Title: Empty Dialogs in Flex Builder
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have been experiencing a strange issue in Flex Builder 3 where certain dialogs such as the Add New Project wizard and the SVN Commit dialog are completely empty save for the title area.

I'm running Flex Builder v3.0 (build 3.02.2.214193) on the Windows 7 RC.  I have tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling Flex Builder to no avail.  I don't think it's Windows 7 causing the issues because it was working a couple of months ago with no problems.  Even more strange is that I have not installed any additional plugins or made any configuration changes to Flex Builder between the time before these problems began and now.

Has anyone else encountered this problem, and if so, know of any solutions?

Here are a couple of screenshots to illustrate the behaviour.

According to this Adobe forums post, there are multiple causes:


SetPoint (as indicated by Scheea)
Wacom Tablet drivers


In addition, comments suggest the following:


UltraMon


These seem to suggest that the cause is any program which monitors keystrokes or mouse movement.

Workaround: In the new wizard dialog above, note the question mark on the bottom left (the help button).  When you click on the help button a help panel is added to the dialog on the right separated from the main dialog by a splitter.  When you drag the splitter the rest of the dialog appears. You may need to scroll to a position where you can see all of its contents, but it should become usable. Resizing the dialog alone was not sufficient for me.

In addition, I couldn't fully use the mouse to select elements so I had to type into the filter field in order for the correct projects to show up.

When coding, I use Dropbox to sync folder in which I keep my projects between 3 computers. 

I use Netbeans as an IDE, and so - I create project groups very often. While creating them, I usually choose "Folder of Projects" option, so it includes all projects found in specific folder. 

Is it possible to tweak Netbeans, that it would store information about created project groups in specific place? Is there any option which changes this setting?

Title: visual studio 2008 / asp.net web forms - is hand coding ~80% of the time too much?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I still find myself hand coding Visual Studio projects more than using the variety of UI-driven menus and dialogs.  For example:


web projects: hand code html/css in Source View vs dealing with the Design View / Properties Window
flushing out class files: code by hand using stuff like the prop-TAB-TAB Create Property keyboard shortcut and good ole Ctrl+[X|C|V] instead of the Class Diagram feature


Do I need to give the dialogs and menus another shot, or is this the current state of IDEs?  Intellisense is the best thing since sliced bread IMO.

Answer 1: 

    
    
I'd be quite content to have Microsoft remove the design view from Visual Studio. I find myself cursing it every time I accidentally hit the button and wait ages for the broken rendering engine to kick in. This is from the perspective of a web developer mind you - I'm sure it's essential for developing windows apps.

Generally I think most of the RAD tools are not particularly useful, and in the long run end up being problematic as they're not very flexible. When developing web forms asp.net applications the listview and repeater are generally the only controls that I use. Hand coding html/css would be the preference for most designers anyway. Tools like Dreamweaver are nice initially when you're learning, but you do get to a stage where you realise you're using them as a glorified text editor.

Intellisense as you mention is utterly bad arse, and the one thing that I would miss if I switched to something like e or Textmate.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I am not a .NET programmer, and I understand Visual Studio does provide a lot of nifty code generation tools. However, I think it's rather important that a developer knows the code in his application. If you feel comfortable hand-coding it because you feel more in control that way, I don't think that should bother you at all.

Also, as someone who writes a lot of HTML/CSS by hand, I know that Visual Studio's Design View does not churn out 'quality' front end code a lot of the time.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I personally hand code html/css as well as my class definitions 99% of the time. Exceptions would be things that would be hard to hand-code otherwise (does anyone hand-code WCF proxies?)

Answer 5: 

    
    
I certainly find the the UI designer only works for the simplest of pages, and even for them only for a few design iterations. I find this for two reasons

1) When laying out a page, there are often several legitimate choices, and I don't like the choices VS makes. For instance, it will set the width of tables using pixel sizes, while for most fluid pages percentages make more sense. Nothing wrong with what it does, but for whatever reason I find myself fighting it more often than not.

2) It hard-codes a lot of style information, and even creates synthetic styles in an in-page style sheet. I'd rather have a concise and comprehensive CSS for the site as a whole, minimizing overrides on each page (or in each element!). Again, I fight it more often than not.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Well the designer for WPF/Silverlight is pretty cumbersome to use. So I pretty much hand code xaml and C#. At the moment I do not do much asp but with MVC, I would assume I would hand code that.

With visual studio having intellisense for a lot different syntaxes now, it is easier then ever to hand code, well, code. :) I mean intellisense works for C#, CSS, javascript, asp, and XML (if set up right). It is pretty easy to code now days. The youngsters have it so easy now days. They do not know how hard it was to code back in the day. 
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
I'd say it absolutely, 100% depends on what you're writing.


If it's a basic CRUD interface for a simple database, then I'd say yes, 80% is way too much.
If it's a Web Application with plenty of JQuery UI and no persistent data source, then 80% is probably less than I'd expect.


As Vadium said, it also depends on what makes you more productive.  Personally, I fly along with Intellisense, but I'm not too good on using UI tools to build an app.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I used to work in Delphi 6, and got very used to having CodeRush's various helpful IDE additions.  Many are now in the IDE itself, or I've managed to replace with something else, but the one feature I REGULARLY find myself wishing I had in Delphi 2007 still, is the ability CodeRush had that added little "connecting lines" between components that were linked to each other (lines showing the connections between TDataSets and TDataSources, for instance).  

Does anyone make something that does that in the newer Delphi IDE?  

=== * LATER NOTE / Clarification * ===

Andreas is correct in his comments below... "I don't think that he meant structural highlighting which works on the source code. He wants "connection lines" between components in the form designer."

He also says "as far as I know there is no such tool for Delphi 2005 or newer".. which is a bummer if true.  (...and if that IS the case, what's the best place to make Delphi IDE feature requests?)

another freeware/opensource option would be to look at CNPack which supports structural highlighting and runs well in Delphi 2009.

I run both CNPack and GExperts in both 2009 and 2006 without any problems.

Title: Visual inheritance in Java
Description: 
    
    
                    
The team in which I work has been getting problems with the visual inheritance of the forms in the Java platform.

We want to develop a base JFrame with some controls in it and to have inherited forms from that base JFrame. The designer of the Netbeans 6.1 does not paint the controls of the base form in the inherited ones, so we can´t use it in the way we want. In the execution time the inherited forms are well painted, with the parent´s controls.

The Netbeans designer

Anyone has solved it? Should we change of IDE?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
AFAIK, Matisse is not really designed to create inhereted forms. It is designed for composition (i.e. create a custom JComponent and drop it into your Matisse Form).

The form designer does not use the java file to create the form, it uses the "form" file. This does not get inhereted. If you absolutely need to use inheritance (which I would recommend against), then you will need to copy the contents of the "form" file into your child class.

Generally, you should create a custom JPanel of some sort (using Matisse or not) and then drop this form into your JFrame. Any custom code/events that needs to be reused should be attached to the JFrame should be created in beans and then added to the form.

Netbeans 7 is looking at revamping the code-generation of Matisse. I'd suggest putting this in as an enhancement request at www.netbeans.org.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Just a general comment, not a real answer to your situation - visual components aren't made for inheritance. For example, see the horrible blunder Sun made by inheriting everything from Component- now you have a JList which you can't use .add() on to add items to. Unless you can fulfill the entire super-class contract (and I know only of several classes that can) prefer composition rather than inheritance. Expose the methods you do plan on fulfilling and a "Component getAsComponent()" method with the explicit declaration that the component shouldn't be changed directly. I find that much easier than having to think about "what should I do if someone uses add(JLabel) to my component? or setLayout()?".

Regarding your specific predicament - I'm using JFormDesigner in IntelliJ IDEA but it might apply as well. JFD has a nice way of using the component BeanInfo information (for component named "MyThingy" the info class would be "MyThingyBeanInfo"). Using that class you can define a lot of things for design-time only consumption, along with special painting methods and other niceties.

When I started programming I was using Ruby and the colorful little notepad that came with it. Since I started learning Java I've been using Eclipse, which is apparently an IDE. Now I've read a bit about this Mono on Reddit, but I don't think I understand exactly what it is. The website says it is a development framework: is that just another word for IDE? I'm a true beginner who wants to work in a number of languages, from Java and Ruby to z80 and ARM9... is there an IDE or development framework that might be best for little me?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
a framework is a set of classes and supporting code to be used to build applications. this can be as simple as the C standard library or as complex as the Smalltalk environment, or may even include the infrastructure for complex application like Dynamic or ERP systems - but essentially a framework is just a class library

an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a tool for writing programs; this tool is essentially a just a program that contains a text-editor that supports compilation and debugging et al

make you dependant on theirselves.

By using Eclipse with the ActionScript plugin you get full code hinting in the same format that you do with intellisense.

it will be cool to have autocompletion  in flash CS3 like the one that comes with eclipse for java (with hints, hierarchies , implementation, autoimports for clases etc . .), i dont know why everyone wants to separate the code from graphical editor , when thats the best part of flash , anyway i always recommend to stay with eclipse since it is very robust and its available for a lot of languages so in case you need to learn other language you already know the IDE and how to use autocompletion.

That way, I cant see easily whether it's a byte, a short, etc.
So my question is: Is there a setting in the Visual Studio IDE that disables this &quot;feature&quot;?
I really want to keep those 0's.
Thank you in advance!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In VS2017 and above: if you use the group separator _ (underscore character),  the leading zeros will not be removed by the editor. See: Hexadecimal, binary, and octal literals
Note that the group separator adds no intrinsic meaning to value; they are just meaningless formatting characters . What I mean by that is that only the digits are preserved when it is evaluated by the parser.  Think of it as all &quot;_&quot; are removed from the string before evaluating. So, &amp;B1_1_1_1 is the same as &amp;B1________________1_1_1.
Some Examples:
  Dim b As Byte
  b = &amp;B0000_1111
  b = &amp;B0_0_0_0_1_1_1_1
  b = &amp;H0_F

In Toolbox you can set certain product versions to stick to the specific installed version and do not offer the updates.

  Disable suggestions list auto-resize on Visual Studio 2019?


I am afraid that you cannot get what you want in this issue so far. And VS IDE does not have such option to control it so far.

The purpose of the automatic adjustment of the scroll box is to facilitate the user to visually see the full name of the method and then confirm and use it. It is from the perspective of the convenience of developing code.

According to your needs, you need a better visual experience and the best suggestion is to add an option on VS IDE to force maintain the size.  So we recommend that you could suggest your feature on our User Voice Forum



In addition, when you finish writing such feature, you can share the link here with us and anyone who is interested in this will vote for you so that it will get more attention from Microsoft.

I'm new to CLion and I'm using it on Ubuntu 18.04. I imported an existing project and when I build it, the following message appears:

conio.h: No such file or directory
 #include &lt;conio.h&gt;


I thought that conio.h was a library included in most Ubuntu distributions.If not, how do I install it or how can I add the dependencies to the project?

Edit: For clarify, I didn't touched anything on the project settings or dependencies yet.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
#include &lt;conio.h&gt; it's a Windows library.  

When you work in Linux, you may use #include &lt;curses.h&gt;
But it's not a standard library!

Intellij refers to these as Indent Guides and from googling that seems to be an accepted term for what you are describing.

I was going to start learning the Swift programming language, and for that, I was going to install Xcode. But I found out that Xcode is only available for macOS, and I have a computer that uses Windows. Is there any way to get Xcode or any software on which I can code in Swift language? Is there any other IDE for Swift other than Xcode?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The xcode swoftware is only available on MacOS. There is a lot of online IDE where you can code in swift like this one. But with this kind of tool you wont be able to create a user interface. It is not possible to create a user interface on any other operating system than MacOS. If you really want to create an application with a user interface then you can always setup a virtual machine with MacOS running on it, install Xcode and start coding ;)

I know that I can press Alt + Shift + L and I will get the Sync with active document.
I also know that I can enable in the Options the feature to work every time I focus on another file.

But I can not find a button in the VS interface to do that. Is it even present? I would expect such a button be somewhere in the top of the interface of the VS. Somewhere near the comment/uncomment buttons (that is just my feeling that it is there, I have no proofs or reasons to think so).

Title: goormIDE changing default project that terminal loads on
Description: 
    
    
                    
I wanted to ask a question about goormIDE, which is very similar in function to c9.io

When I first started on my container, I named my first project goorm-IDE-test2 in order to learn the node.js language. 

However, I since then started work on a subproject, called myBootcamp. 

Whenever I first load the container, the default path of the first terminal is 

root@goorm:/workspace/goorm-IDE-test2#


and I want to change this so the default should be

root@goorm:/workspace/myBootcamp#


I've discovered that I can open a separate terminal off the new project, but I can't load myBootcamp as the default from the start. 

How can I do this, if possible?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

Open [Preference] (type alt + p)

Title: Problem pushing to GitHub with Codenvy: &ldquo;Can&#39;t store ssh key. Unable get private ssh key.&rdquo;
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using Codenvy for my rails app. When I run git push -u origin --all with my rails application i get a blank terminal. When I push using the Git &gt; Remotes &gt; Push menu, I get the error "Can't store ssh key. Unable get private ssh key."

Is this a problem with OAuth, because I have not set that up yet. I tried following the Codenvy git documentation, but they provided no info on what to fill into the &lt;HOST_IP&gt;, &lt;SERVER_PORT&gt;, &lt;CHE_HOST_IP&gt;, yourClientSecret, and yourClientID parameters. I have followed many online tutorials trying to connect my Codenvy App to GitHub, and none of them have been successful. I cannot seem to find one definitive way to do this. I am new to Codenvy, so could you please explain this to me?

Reproduction Steps:
I have already:


Added my Git user info to my preferences
Added my GitHub info using git config --global user.name/email "name/email"
Added my remote origin with my repository name using git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:/
Generated an SSH key using VCS under the host name "github.com" and added the public ssh to my GitHub account


UPDATE: I have fixed by git origin and now when I run git push -u origin -all, I get the following error:

! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Git-Ibraheem/toy_app.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.


When using the Codenvy Git menu, I get the same error:

failed to push 'master -&gt; master' to 'https://github.com/Git-Ibraheem/toy_app.git'. Try to merge remote changes using pull, and then push again.


When I run git pull origin master I get the following:

error: Pulling is not possible because you have unmerged files.
hint: Fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm &lt;file&gt;'
hint: as appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit.`


Fix:
I ran the command git reset --hard HEAD and then git push -u origin --all. This was succesful!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

  using git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:/


That should be a full URL git@bitbucket.org:/MyAccount/MyRepo


  Generated an SSH key using VCS under the host name "github.com" and added the public ssh to my GitHub account


That... would have nothing to do with bitbucket then (which you just mentioned as your "origin").


  Is this a problem with OAuth, 


If you are using SSH, OAuth is not involved, so no.
    
    
Title: Kotlin&#39;s safe-cast (or in this context &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;-cast) hides possible NullPointerException warning by Android Studio
Description: 
    
    
                    
While developing in AS with Java, below line shows warning that toggleSoftInput may produce NPE. Which is quite helpful if you forgot NPE check.

InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) mContext.getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
imm.toggleSoftInput(....);


But in the case of Kotlin, this becomes a problem. Casting with as means IDE won't bother to check if toggleSoftInput() may produce NPE or not because as implicitly implies so.

val imm = mContext.getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE) as InputMethodManager
imm.toggleSoftInput()


Once I use safe-cast as?, IDE warns me to make safe-call to imm as it may be null.

General Question: What if developer forgets to safe-cast, isn't Kotlin's safe-cast implicitly killing off IDE user-friendly capabilities or I'm missing out something?

Specific Question: Is there any possible way to resolve those issues other than not forgetting safe-cast? :)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Sadly this specific method:

context.getSystemService(@NonNull String name)


is very old API and that's one of it's flaws - it returns an Object of unspecified type and nullability so there's no other way but performing unsafe/safe casting.

You have few newer alternatives that will give you safe nullable Service class objects:

// available since API 23:
val ims23 = context.getSystemService(InputMethodManager::class.java)

// available in androidx.core
val imsCompat = ContextCompat.getSystemService(context, InputMethodManager::class.java)

// available in androidx.core:core-ktx
val imsKtx = context.getSystemService&lt;InputMethodManager&gt;()

Title: RegEx: Find &amp; Replace snake_case to UpperCamelCase/PascalCase Between Characters
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using my IDE's Find &amp; Replace (w/ RegEx) feature to find &amp; replace the type parameter of arguments to go from snake_case to PascalCase (AKA UpperCamelCase). There are several files and lines throughout the project that need to be changed, and manually doing so is quite error prone and tedious (plus I am sure I am going to need the essential pattern again for future changes).

For example:

CURRENT: function find_all_by_name_and_status(_i_find_all_by_name_and_statusCriteria find_all_by_name_and_status_criteria) ...


Should be:

DESIRED: function find_all_by_name_and_status(IFindAllByNameAndStatusCriteria find_all_by_name_and_status_criteria) ...


The patterns I am using are the following:

FIND: (?&lt;=\()_(.)(Criteria)*

REPLACE: \U$1\L


The replace pattern will work, as far as I can see, if the 1st found capture group is correct (the letter just after an "_").

The core pattern of _(.) finds the correct components to replace, however, it captures the other parts of the string as well. So, I added a positive lookbehind (?&lt;=\() to start at the opening parentheses and an ending dummy capture for (Criteria)*. The entire pattern seems to cause the core pattern to only match once and not repeatedly. (?R) does not seem to help either.

P.S.

It looks the (Criteria)* does not do anything either, but I figured that is the second problem to address after getting the core pattern to find all matches / repeat.

I feel like I am close to a solution, but not quite there yet. I, of course, could be VERY off base on the solution. Any help would be appreciated.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This expression, 

(.*\()|(_)([a-z])([a-z]*)|(Criteria.*)


which is not really the best one, with a replacement of something similar to:

$1\U$3\L$4\E$5


might likely work here (the \E is for demoing).

In this demo on the right panel, the expression is explained, if you might be interested.

Title: don&#39;t use scrolloff=5 for mouse clicks in (neo)vim
Description: 
    
    
                    
I use (neo)vim with mouse=a and scrolloff=5. Clicking on one of the top or bottom five lines with the mouse causes the screen to jump (so that the new cursor position is more centered), which distracts me. Is there any way to disable "so=5" for mouse-clicking only?

I use (neo)vim in different terminal emulators on linux.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can disable the scrolloff value using a click mapping, refer :help &lt;LeftMouse&gt; However, you'll have to re-enable the scroll setting afterwards as re-enabling the setting in the mapping would again cause the view to jump up/down.

This will disable the scrolloff setting and the view will remain unchanged:

nnoremap &lt;LeftMouse&gt; :let &amp;so=0&lt;cr&gt;&lt;LeftMouse&gt;


With the above, the view will not jump, but you'll have to re-enable so

We could re-enable it in the same mapping, but that would mean, you'll see the same behavior of view jumping up or down as so is applied immediately after it's set.

nnoremap &lt;LeftMouse&gt; :let temp=&amp;so&lt;cr&gt;:let &amp;so=0&lt;cr&gt;&lt;LeftMouse&gt;:let &amp;so=temp&lt;cr&gt;


So, there isn't an ideal solution to what yo want (at least I know of). You could either disable so completely and use something like zz or get used to the behavior of so on mouse click.

Title: CMake: Adding IDE visibility for common headers in a multi-library/binary C++ project
Description: 
    
    
                    
NOTE: This question regards getting headers to show up in IDEs, not just getting them to be included in the build. The latter is not a concern here.

I have a project that looks basically like this, and I'm trying to convert its build system to CMake:

project/
  include/
     common/
        common1.hpp
        common2.hpp
        ...
     lib1/
        file1_1.hpp
        file1_2.hpp
        ...
     lib2/
        file2_1.hpp
        file2_2.hpp
        ...
     ...
     bin1/
        ...
  src/
     CMakeLists.txt (project)
     lib1/
        file1_1.cpp
        file1_2.cpp
        ...
        CMakeLists.txt (add_library)
     lib2/
        file2_1.cpp
        file2_2.cpp
        ...
        CMakeLists.txt (add_library)
     ...
     bin1/
        main.cpp
        ...
        CMakeLists.txt (add_executable)


In each leaf directory's CMakeLists.txt, I'm including the corresponding header files in the add_library() or add_executable() command, for maximum IDE compatibility.

My question is: How do I wrangle CMake to get the non-library-specific headers under common/ to show up in IDEs as well?

My current plan is to just assign each of them to the library/binary that makes the most use of them, but this is unsatisfying. I'm also not sure what this will end up doing to the project structure presentation in various IDEs; it would be best if it mirrored the physical layout of the files somewhat.

Note that I'm currently stuck using CMake 2.8.12.2, so many 3.x-only features will not be an option for me.

Title: How to disable stepping in disassembly mode in IAR Workbench?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm running IAR Embedded Workbench 8.30.1.17148.  When I enter debug / step mode, it opens the disassembly window and starts stepping at the disassembly level -- not at the source code level.

I can close the disassembly window and restart the program, but like an unwelcome guest, the disassembly window opens again and it steps at the disassembly level.

How do I convince IAR Workbench that I really want to step at source level?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I was getting so annoyed by this same behavior, I searched IAR FAQ to no avail, but got a speedy response from their support:

In regard to your question about the Assembly Window:
1. When the IDE is opened you can close the Assemblt window by selecting the "x"
on the upper right corner of the assembly window.
Than you select the "C" editor section. If you single step now it will stay only in the
"C" section and the assemblt window will stay close.
2. If this isn't the behaviour you expereince please do the following:
1. Highlight the project you are workign with.
2. Right click and select "open containing folder"
3. Exit the IDE
4. In the project folder directory that is open rename the "setting" directory to "setting.save"
5. Open the IDe again.

So it is so simple the resolution that worked for me: close the automatically popped-up disassembly, click in the source code window so cursor is blinking there, then step, and disassembly does not get re-popped-up. If I just dismiss the disassembly, it pops-up again on the next step.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Set a breakpoint in the source code and run to it. Then you can step in the source code level.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If you choose the the editor window (put your mouse on the editor window then left click) then single stepping is through the source code. However, if you choose the the disassembly window (put your mouse on the disassembly window then left click) then single stepping goes through every assembly instruction. 
    
    
Title: Annonate fields created in a stdClass?
Description: 
    
    
                    
class Foo
{
    public function bar(): \stdClass
    {
        $obj = new \stdClass;
        $obj-&gt;test = 'test';
        return $obj;
    }
}


When doing $foo = new Foo;, is it possible to annotate Phpdoc so that the IDE can autocomplete to $foo-&gt;bar()-&gt;test?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'm sorry, there's currently no way to document associative arrays or stdClass objects in phpDocumentor or custom annotations formats understood by NetBeans.

From a design perspective, perhaps it could make sense to use proper classes:

class Bar
{
    /**
     * @var string
     */
    public $test;
}

class Foo
{
    public function bar(): Bar
    {
        $obj = new Bar;
        $obj-&gt;test = 'test';
        return $obj;
    }
}


If you need no logic at all, the classes can be empty:

/**
 * @property string $test
 */
class Bar
{
}


Otherwise, you can always trick the IDE with a stub file that defines a fake class but is never actually executed and then pretend that your variable belongs to that class:

$foo = new Foo;
/* @var $bar Bar *//** @var Bar $bar */
$bar = $foo-&gt;bar();
$bar-&gt;…


… where /* @var $bar Bar */ is for NetBeans 8 and earlier and /** @var Bar $bar */ for NetBeans 10 (and many other IDEs).

In addition to having the correct things checked in File | Settings | Editor | General | Code Folding, what worked for me was ALSO going to File | Settings | Editor | Inspection Settings and ticking Enable code analysis, and magically all my code folding arrows appeared and syntax highlighting started working.

It is a JetBrains bug. That is because according to the documentation the folding should work once you go to File | Settings | Editor | General | Code Folding, but it does not.

I am debugging a react app. If I click on this link given by the terminal, IDE Atom is Opening. How can I change it to another IDE like VS code for example?


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Atom and VScode are text editors. If you go to the file SingleVariation.js from the link and right click on it you can select get info. This opens the get info window shown below.



About halfway down the window is a section designated as "Open With". This determines which application will open a file. The menu in that section may show Fetch. That just means it's looking for apps that could be used to open that file. When the search is finished you can pull down that menu and set it to VScode. After that click the button that says "change all". Now whenever you double-click on a .js file, it will open in VScode.
    
    
Title: Do the triple-quoted (docstring) messages in Python appear while typing in IDEs other than IDLE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I usually write scripts to calculate or process things for my own consumption. Now I'm trying to write scripts for others.

I use both IDLE and a terminal, but I like just like the IDLE interface and find it more helpful. Today I "discovered" that I can add triple-quoted text under class and def and see them in real time when using IDLE, and I realize I can use those to help others know how to use these classes and methods.

But if run from a terminal this is all lost.

Question: Is it only IDLE users who are seeing these cues while they are typing a line that uses the class or method, or is this something that people using terminal could see while typing if they wanted to? I know that one could type A.__doc__ to see it for example, but the pop-up window is really convenient and helpful.

class A(object):
    """hey A!"""

    def __init__(self, x):
        """hey __int__!"""

        self.x = x

    def sqrx(self):
        """hey sqrx!"""

        print self.x**2




 (just to see what would happen if)



But if I do this from a terminal all these prompts disappear.

 nothing.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The "triple-quoted messages" are docstrings, and they appear in different contexts.

For example:


When hitting ctrl+q (or whatever key is bound to the "Quick Documentation" action) in PyCharm:



There is also an option to display the quick documentation pop-up while typing.
When calling help on the function:

&gt;&gt; help(foo)
Help on function foo in module __main__:

foo()
     foo's docstring

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am looking for a nice IDE for LUA, that supports 'jump to definition', even if that definition is in another file (in the same project).

I am mostly using Intellij, but all plugins dont seem to support this.

For example:

-- classtest.lua

Account = {}
Account.__index = Account

function Account:create(balance)
    local acnt = {}             -- our new object
    setmetatable(acnt,Account)  -- make Account handle lookup
    acnt.balance = balance      -- initialize our object
    return acnt
end

function Account:withdraw(amount)
    self.balance = self.balance - amount
end


Now in another file i do:

require("classtest");

local acc = Account:create(1000)
acc:withdraw(100);


I want to be able to jump to the withdraw function.
It would greatly help me, cause right now, refactoring and code navigation is very tedious.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You may try ZeroBrane Studio, as it provides fuzzy symbol matching, so you can select withdraw and go to Search | Navigate | Go to Symbol (Ctrl/Cmd-B) to show the list of symbols matching across the entire project. In most cases the first match will be what you'd expect, so you can simply press Enter to jump there. The fuzzy search also shows you the preview of the symbol definition.

I have searched through the whole internet and didn't find anything useful. Could please anyone suggest how to make a variable explorer in Sublime text 3 like in Spyder?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
(Spyder maintainer here) If you want to create a representation of your current namespace (what is shown in the Variable Explorer), you can take a look at how we build it here, specially the value_to_display function, the one really responsible for that.

The viewers (for lists, dicts, Numpy arrays and DataFrames) are implemented in PyQt, and you can find them here.

To bring the value of a variable from a running IPython kernel and pass it to the viewers, we created our own kernel that serializes a value and sends it to Spyder. In Spyder we deserialize it and pass it to the Viewers here (look for the CreateEditor method).

The process is really more complex than this little explanation, but I hope you can get an idea of how it works.

Make sure your input field's line type is set as 'Multiline New Line'. Get the text from OnValueChanged event of your input field. Split the string by '\n'. You will get the array of lines. The length of that array is number of lines in your input field. Add 1 to that length value &amp; use it as your last line number.

Title: an implementation for breakpoint in code editor of Qt
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm working on an IDE for debugging scripts and codes in Qt
my duty is to implement GUI and there is a very good example of Code Editor in Qt Documentation in this url: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-widgets-codeeditor-example.html

all of the introduced features (like line number and highlighting and syntaxes)
are good explained but there are some words about implementing break point as an extension to the Code Editor documentation says:


  In addition to line numbers, you can add more to the extra area, for instance, break points.


I just wondered since the document explicitly stated that a break point implementation would be the next step of developing a code editor component but as I googled and searched web sites I didn't find any relevant article or project with the related implementation or an example of implementing breakpoints into an IDE.
I just wanted to ask if you know any example or guide about this matter I would be very glad if you can help me through this or otherwise I would sub-class and implement it by myself and ask much more detailed questions here.

thanks in advance for reading :)

UPDATE

I end up implementing such a features like : breakpoint and breakpoint area, current line that is running, step over, step in, continue and other debugger features and I used PythonQt as the API for communicating with Python/C API to debug my scripts from.
I used QTextBlockUserData to implement the breakpoint data and it's aspects so it'll be managed by the block's data itself.
that was all the things I was searching for in the first place. if anyone had any question I'd be happy to help.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
My best guess would be to check out the QtCreator breakpoint support.

The UI part is contained in this class and others:

https://github.com/qt-creator/qt-creator/blob/master/src/plugins/debugger/breakhandler.cpp

... while the real logic depends on the engine. There are different debugger engines like gdb, cdb for Windows, QML debugger etc.).

Looking at the gdb engine, there is a gdb process running in MI mode. This mode makes it easy for programs to parse gdb output; try e.g. gdb -i=mi programToDebug. Also, the documentation might help: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gdb/html_node/gdb_211.html.

Qt Creator is then reading the gdb process' output to display information like call stacks; see e.g. https://github.com/qt-creator/qt-creator/blob/master/src/plugins/debugger/gdb/gdbengine.cpp#L244

So what I would do is this:


implement UI to set breakpoints, start debugger etc.
run debugger in an own process and machine mode (if available)
connect input / output of that process to set breakpoints, display call stack etc.

The configuration at Datagrip:

'DB_NAME': 'postgres',
'USER': 'postgres',
'HOST': 'pz01',
'PORT': 5432,


I also tried with host as the ip, and localhost and neither works.
The password as null, because the db service log shows that by default it does not have password.

Answer 1: 

    
    
A good check point, for what a Prolog system should do, is always GNU Prolog (for some issues version 1.3.0 is even better). It is very close to the ISO core standard, and doesn't have a lot of novelties. So you should get something along:

GNU Prolog 1.4.4 (64 bits)
Compiled Apr 23 2013, 16:05:07 with cl

?- write('Hello World'), nl.  
Hello World

yes
?- write("Hello World"), nl.  
[72,101,108,108,111,32,87,111,114,108,100]


Explanation 1 Single Quotes:   


  The write/1 predicate should write
  atoms unquoted. Which means atoms that usually need quotes, will be
  written without quotes. If you want to show quotes you can use
  writeq/1. And atom is in single quotes.


Explanation 2 Double Quotes:


  Double quotes were traditionally used
  to denote lists of character codes, so that one can easily define DCG
  rules. A lot of Prolog systems divert here, and even the ISO core
  standard allows character atoms instead codes.


But usually you can ask the Prolog system what it does with double quotes, and even modify the behaviour. Just use the Prolog flag double_quotes. Here is what you can do in GNU-Prolog:

?- current_prolog_flag(double_quotes, X).  
X = codes

?- set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, chars).  
yes

?- write("Hello World"), nl.  
[H,e,l,l,o, ,W,o,r,l,d]
