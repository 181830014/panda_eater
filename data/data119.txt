Title: Code::Blocks for understanding C++ code it can&#39;t build
Description: 
    
    
                    
Have a C++ source I probably can't build in Code::Blocks.  If I use it as an editor, would it be helpful in gaining understanding of the code?  (Like Intellisense).

How does it compare to Visual Studio in this respect?

How should I go about doing it?

Can it somehow utilize gdb information (When I run it in gdb, there is a lot of information available)



It is Linux gcc/Makefile based.

The main executable is in one directory, but there are many includes, libraries etc.
If I just included all sources I would get sources for other executables (with similar code).

I expect to increase my understanding about where things are located over time.

Note 1: This is Linux, but I can easily edit on Windows. And I am trying to build under Cygwin.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Code::Blocks sounds too light weight for your tastes. Try NetBeans. It has very good hinting tools, doesn't have the infamous copy+paste bug, Its easier to navigate files, and can deal with makefiles better then C::B. Additionally it has a nice interface for debugging, and an exceptional one for performance monitoring.

I would reccomend you install a linux distro through WUBI and forgo using Windows.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I have used NetBeans, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, and CodeLite. I don't normally write software under Windows anymore, but when I did CodeLite was the most elegant one I found. Debugging was a snap (mingw + GDB), all the meta information about your project is stored in an sqlite db (which I think is a great design), and it supports makefiles.

I think NetBeans would work great as well, but definitely give CodeLite a shot.

Title: How to add include directory to Visual C++ Express 2010?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Include directories aren't configurable via Tools/Options anymore. I see no way to do that via Solution Properties also. I have set INCLUDE environment variable, restarted VS but cl.exe (rc.exe really) still misses a header file.

fatal error RC1015: cannot open include file 'winres.h'.

C:&gt; echo %INCLUDE%

C:&gt; ls "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include\mfc\WINRES.H"
WINRES.H &lt;-- it exists

    

        
Title: Dreamviewer &amp; Zend Framework project: Wrong path mapping
Description: 
    
    
                    
I tried all the day to set up a Zend Framework project in Dreamweaver CS5.5. Now, after a few hours spending on google and the CS5.5 doc, i am still not able to debug a Zend Framework project in Dreamweaver:

Let's say, i have a module called "admin" in /application/modules/admin. If i try the Live View feature, Live Code, or the dynamic files discover, it fails at all. 

If I try to debug the IndexController of the AdminModule, Dreamweaver always tries to render the page http://foo.bar/application/modules/admin/controllers/IndexController.php, insteadof http://foo.bar/admin[/index/index]

Is there any way to get those features working with Dreamweaver CS5.5? 

Also, the include path does not work. The /public/index.php includes something like require_once 'Zend/Application.php';. Where does Dreamweaver search? He tells me that he can not find the file http://foo.bar/Zend/Application.php. Omg, srsly?

I hope there are some Dreamweaver PHP developers out there which can help me. 

Btw, I am using Zend Studio at the moment and wanted to get a "quick" look into the new CS5.5 features :/

Update 16.05.2012

Little update from me. I'm currently Using PHPStorm from JetBrains. It is the best IDE I ever had. (Ecpilse/Aptana/Zend Studio/PHPDesigner). Autocomplete for nearly everything, huge plugin repository and much nice features like LESS Support, NodeJS Support, PHPUnit integration or an integrated Git Client. Give it a try. It's free for open source projects.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Dreamweaver can technically work with anything, but it's really designed to work with procedural php.  

I would recommend the eclipse software with the pdt plugin or net beans.  WAY better for supporting a zend framework project imo.

I'm not bagging on dreamweaver, it's a nice tool (especially for html/css), but for OO PHP programming, it's really not designed for it.

Many times I'm having a problem with printing in function foo, and I want to look for all occurences of Print in code which is reachable in the Control Flow Graph from function foo. Or in all code in the paths between foo and bar (as I verified an assumption is true before I call foo, and false after I reach bar, so I want to find out what's happening in between).

Is there any tool that allows me to do that easily. I'm not going to compile all my C code with CIL, and write an OCaml module to do search with the CFG. I want something that works with minimum hassle.

Eclipse CDT should be able to do that (you can calculate the CFG with show function hiererchy), but I didn't find something similar there.

I'm now targeting C/C++, but I'll be glad to hear about similar tools? I'm not sure CQL have a way to express that.
    

        
Title: Include in Project slowness with Visual Studio 2010
Description: 
    
    
                    
Our company won a web project from a new client.  Their old vendor basically zipped up the code (C#/ASP.NET, including an enormous number of media files) and FTPed it to us and is no longer answering phone calls/supporting it in any way.  There's no solution file, no project files, just code.

So I created an empty project locally and moved it to a network path and moved their code inside it because I don't even have enough space to host it locally.  Their architecture is suspect, but I need to get it back up and running ASAP so I don't have time to reconsider that at the moment.  I opened the project I created, selected "show all files" and attempted to include all of the paths (both media files and code paths) and the application hung.  One of the media folders has something like 65,000 files in it.  Do I even need to include this?

Regardless, it seems like doing "Include in Project" is taking forever, I've spent hours wrestling with it, trying to do one folder at a time...but often it's just hanging and I have to kill the process.  Is there a faster way to deal with this?  I tried editing the project file directly but including this media folder made the solution take absolutely forever to load.

Any general suggestions on how to approach this situation?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
as long there is no direct reference you don't need to include media files into the project.
I bet those files are just loaded runtime from a procedure. To make sure make a full search for the media folder in the sources.

Imho get just the files to a local store, create a solution, and then add all resources and sources. If needed you can copy the media files later again into the project.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I had the same problem with local files. I probably killed VS2010 three times since it would always seem to lock up. I then recreated the folder structure, but not with the correct name, then save the project, open it with a text editor and change the names to the actual structure. Finally use "Add /p/div
Answer 3: 

    
    
It's not hanging - if you leave it long enough it will finish. Know what you mean though - it took half a day to include dojo on one of my projects.

You may want to try SharpDevelop to include large folders into your projects - it seems much, much faster than visual studio when given this task. You can then just re-open the project in vs. Hope this helps.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I just upgraded to XCode 4.0.2 and ran into a strange issue. Every time when the app stops at a breakpoint, XCode shows the target view instead of the .m file. When I manually click the file and show it, and click step, then the IDE switches to the target view again. This makes debugging virtually impossible. THis only happens to my own project. Sample projects work fine. Please help, it drives me nuts and I can not find where did I get the settings wrong.

P.S, this project worked fine on XCode 3, after upgrading to Xcode 4 I had problems with my targets. After wrestling a while with the schemes it finally builds and runs fine, but I can not do debugging when making changes because of this. I am not sure if I messed up some settings during the time to change the scheme and target settings.

Ok, found the problem, but still not having the real solution. The situation is that the project was originally in one directory called WorldClock, after having problems when installed XCode 4, I copied the folder to another folder called WorldClockNew, and started in this folder. However somehow the build directory is still pointing to the old directory. After deleting the Build folder under WorldClock, this problem went away. However I still can not find where in the XCode settings to correct the Build path..

Answer 1: 

    
    
The initial working directory will depend on how the application is launched and you should never make any assumptions about what this will be. For Finder launches it will typically be / as you have seen, while for Xcode launches it will usually be the same directory as the executable (although you can change this in the settings for the executable). There are various other ways of launching an app though, e.g. from the command line, so the initial working directory can be pretty much anything the user wants it to be.

If you just want to find some specific file which resides at a specific location relative to your app, e.g. a data file that your app needs, then you should just get the path to your application bundle and use that, not the working directory.

If the code is written in cross platform c/c++ (=has no references to native Win32 API) you can probably just recompile the project on linux with gcc. You will have to create a makefile that would instruct gcc to build an so file for you on linux.
    
    
Title: Way to separate files from folders in Eclipse?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've recently switched from Windows to OSX and I'm looking for a proper IDE. I was using PHPDesigner on windows and now I'm trying Eclipse on OSX.

So in PHPDesigner and some other IDEs I've used over the years, there was a way to split the file tree into distinct folders and files. At the top would be the file tree like normal, and below it was another box that contained just the files in the selected folder. This is good for me as alot of the projects I've been working on have more then a few files in each folder.

Eclipse simply has the tree view, and when you click on a folder it lists all the sub-directories and files, quickly cluttering the tree and making it harder to navigate to different directories.

Is there a way to make Eclipse split the directory/files from its tree browser? Any other IDE suggestions for OSX?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
When it comes to"un-cluttering" the tree of files/directories, you can use mylyn (which is already part of Eclipse: you don't have to install it).

See this tutorial: mylyn has a task-focused display approach which will let you display only what you are working on.




  Mylyn's focusing facilities can be applied to all the views that show context in the Eclipse SDK: Package Explorer, Navigator, Project Explorer, Outline, Problems, Tasks, Debug, Packages, Types, and Members.
  The focused mode of any tree view, such as the Project Explorer, adds interest decoration, filtering, and expansion management. List views, such as Problems, are also sorted by interest when focused.
  Thanks to this generic support, you can use Mylyn for non-Java projects, such as PHP development.

    
    
Title: Compiling D with Code::Blocks
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm having trouble compiling D programs in Code::Blocks.  Here's what I'm doing:


In accordance with my organization conventions, I have unzipped the Digital Mars D2 compiler to C:\Compilers\dmd2.  I also have the Digital Mars C/C++ compiler at C:\Compilers\dm.
For the "Toolchain executables" tab in the "Global compiler settings" window, I have set the fields to...

Compiler installation directory: C:\Compilers\dmd2\windows
C compiler: dmd.exe
C++ compiler: dmd.exe
Linker for dynamic libs: dmd.exe
Linker for static libs: lib.exe
Debugger: windbg.exe
Resource compiler: rcc.exe (This is the default file, which does not exist.  I'm not sure what to set this to.)
Make program: make.exe

I have the following listed as additional paths:

C:\Compilers\dmd2\windows\lib
C:\Compilers\dmd2\windows\bin



When I start a new D project, I do not see any syntax highlighting.  Attempting to compile and run a simple "hello world" program results in the following error:

"Hello World in D - Debug" uses an invalid compiler. Probably the toolchain path within the compiler options is not setup correctly?! Skipping...

Title: How can I disable Cider (WPF Gui Editor) within VS2010?
Description: 
    
    
                    
When opening a XAML file in VS2010 Professional, the studio becomes unresponsive for 5-7 seconds and many local controls are marked with error bars, since they do not support design time usage. This also happens after a debugged application is terminated.

I've got a i5 CPU, 16GB RAM and an SSD, so I don't think my H/W specs are at fault.

I'm already opening documents in full XAML view (as suggested here) and I've closed all clutterboxes (Toolbar, Document Outline, Data Source) to no avail.

Currently I'm using the XML editor for my sanity, but of course this also means no IntelliSense at all.

Is there a way to completely disable the WPF Designer in Visual Studio 2010 without loosing XAML IntelliSense capabilities?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't know if there is a way to use a lightweight XML editor that preserves IntelliSense inside Visual Studio. However I suggest you to try kaxaml.

From the website:


  Kaxaml is designed to be "notepad for XAML." It's supposed to be simple and lightweight and make it easy to just try something out. It also has some basic support for intellisense and some fun plugins (including one for snippets, one for cleaning up your XAML and for rendering your XAML to an image). 

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I had the same problem with WPF XAML. The only way I found so far is to use XML editor. Yes, you will not have IntelliSense anymore but there is no better way here. Using external editors like Kaxaml helps only for primitive XAML files which do not use anything from other XAMLs (Kaxaml doesn't support projects or at least didn't supported them, so it is not useful for real projects). You can also try using Expression Blend for editing XAML files but it is also not that good alternative.

Please add 

if (DesignerProperties.GetIsInDesignMode(this)) 
   return;


to Constructor, OnApplyTemplate and Loaded event handler, that will ignore all design time processing and make the controls load faster.
    
    
Title: How to have change debugger setting in Eclipse for a launch file
Description: 
    
    
                    
His,

I have been trying to find out why starting DevMode with Debugger from Eclipse was so slow and noticed in the list of processes on my machine the following line:

/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.0_14/bin/java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,suspend=y,address=localhost:47248 ...

Apparently the application is suspended to wait until the debugger is connected which takes about 2 minutes. I would like to set "suspend=n". Does anyone know where I could set this directive. The vm section in Eclipse launch configuration is empty and if I paste the updated debugger config there is a error telling that the values are entered twice. 

As I understand it, Eclipse takes this config from somewhere and inserts it automatically when I run launch configurations in debugger mode. 

Thanks

You can't remove that parameter and, if you could, it wouldn't make a difference. When you connect a new browser to the GWT OOPHM instance it has to compile the entire project for use in development mode. This is what takes time, not waiting for the debugger to attach.

Title: Have the structure view &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to a DFM in Delphi XE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a way to have the "Structure View" in Delphi XE "stick" to a particular DFM and not follow editor context?

In Delphi 7 and older this was its behavior, but in XE, it follows the context, meaning that whenever you edit code, it shows the structure for that code.

I have components structures in the DFM that are used for hierarchical description of a UI model, and for that, the structure view is very convenient. However, the code associated to that DFM is in (other) plain units (UI/logic separation). So whenever I switch from the DFM unit to one of those other units (even just for a quick lookup), it loses focus of the DFM structure.
When going back to the DFM unit, it shows the (useless*) structure of the code of the DFM unit, and not that of the DFM components, you have to re-enter the visual editor and manually select something there to get the structure back...

If the solution involves the structure view never showing the structure of code, I would be happy with that, as I'm already using another tool for that purpose.

*PS: "useless" because the content of the DFM unit is auto-generated.

This might sound trivial, but have you thought about copying the view to the clipboard with PrintScreen, and then pasting it into paintbrush, so you can see it even when you aren't looking at the form any more?
    
    
Title: Another Netbeans issue | cannot find symbol method, but correctly declared
Description: 
    
    
                    
this has been a crappy day, besides the IDE not compiling/deploying because of this bug and waisting valuable time, I finally get it to deploy it suddenly I start getting this weird message (after compiling and running it several times):
T:\Users\Triztian\Documents\RHT System\RHTUBSDB\src\java\controllers\OrderSearch.java:64: cannot find symbol
symbol  : method metadata(java.lang.Long)
location: class BO.CoverForm
            OrderExtraInfoDTO foundInformation = frmCover.metadata(foundOrder.getReferenceNumber());
it is my understanding that this means that my method isn't declared, but thats not the situation as my method is clearly declared and coded.

CoverForm.java:


public OrderExtraInfoDTO metadata(Long ReferenceNumber) {
        OrderExtraInfoDTO foundInformation = new OrderExtraInfoDTO();
        try{
            foundInformation =  lnkAddInformation.fetchInformation(ReferenceNumber);
        } catch (DAOException daoe) {
            this.setError("additional_information", daoe.getMessage());
        }
        return foundInformation;
    }


And the servlet that calls the CoverForm.java method.

OrderSearch.java (Extends HttpServlet):



  CoverDTO foundCover = frmCover.search(foundOrder.getReferenceNumber());
            OrderExtraInfoDTO foundInformation = frmCover.metadata(foundOrder.getReferenceNumber());
            UpgradesDTO foundUpgrades = frmUpgrades.search(foundOrder.getReferenceNumber());

I've tried renaming the method and didn't have any success, any help is truly appreciated as I'm getting frustrated with NB 6.9.1 because of some crashes and another weird bug (might catch an entomologist's attention) which locks the editor and displays a message saying: "Refactoring cannot be done in the given context" whenever I press delete, forcing me to restart the IDE.

EDIT

Ok, so I've removed the classes that I posted and merged them in a more appropriate place, however I still get that silly symbol not found error but on a different symbol(another method) this time.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Netbeans 6.9.1 is a very robust IDE. You may run into problems like the one you mention above, if:


You run your NB without enough disk space available. Make sure that you have at least 2 GB free on your file system for the necessary temporary files.   
You have a very large number of projects active in your project space. Reduce this number to just the needed projects, by deleting and reopening more often.


Hope this helps ...

I'm currently learning Qt programming with Ruby.  Does anyone know an IDE that provides code completion for the Qt APIs when using Ruby?

I'm using NetBeans at the moment - I've set it up to use the standard Ruby interpreter as I didn't know how to get Qt working with JRuby - would getting this set up correctly solve my problem?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you are using Linux, you can try KDevelop with the Ruby plugin. If there is one IDE supporting both Ruby and Qt, it's KDevelop.

If you are using Ubuntu, it is a bit of trouble because there is no .deb packages available for the Ruby plugin, you will have to build the plugin yourself.  

There is some instructions to build the php plugin for Ubuntu here : http://milianw.de/blog/building-kdevplatform-kdevelop-and-the-php-plugin-from-svn. I suspect that the procedure should be almost the same for the ruby plugin.

Description: 
    
    
                    
This is kind of irritating, but I am using Eclipse PDT and code hinting only works on already saved portions of data. That is, assume I write code:

$o = new SomeObject();
$o-&gt;


(assuming SomeObject has public properties) Now when I hit Ctrl+space I get "No matches found". If I save and then hit Ctrl+space, suddenly PDT knows properties of SomeObject. Now let's assume I have this code saved:

$o = new SomeObject();
$o-&gt;destroyTheUniverse();

I've been using Visual C# express through 2005, 2008 and 2010 editions.

Title: Xcode Debugging Limitations
Description: 
    
    
                    
One of the annoyances I've faced when debugging on macs native IDE, xcode, is that the debbugers ability to read through recursive pointers - ie, a pointer pointing at a pointer pointing at a pointer pointing at data I want to read - is limited to around 4 'recurses', after which it will show the pointers structure but will show every property in as containing no data. In actual projects, these pointers are normally pointing at classes that contain further pointers.

This can lead to circumstances where the debugger will not display the data in std::string, will show std::vectors as empty - it has the ability to read through these natively under less complex circumstances - and other assorted issues . Before I figured this out I spent a long time trying to discern why my variables had suddenly gone blank.

This was a long time ago and I have since gotten used to it, but I feel inclined to ask about it now;

EDIT:

I am using xcode 3.2.2, I might try upgrading to the latest and see how that goes.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is this a bug in the IDE, or a limitation? Is there an options file I can modify to increase its level of inlining? Is there some apple developer page containing information on this? (I have spent some time googling)

Title: Program/IDE to save state of a running program and restore later
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a simulator written in C++ which reads a file and processes it line by line. This is a time consuming process. I mostly run into rum time errors where the program crashes after 15-20 mins. I start debugging and the program takes the same amount of time to hit the break point I set . I examine a few variables and step through the code to see whats happening , make some changes and restart my program again. Most of the times, I have to debug the program multiple times before I make the actual code changes. Waiting for 15 mins every time for the execution to hit the breakpoint is wasteful. Is there a way I can save the program state a particular breakpoint and then later just start running/debugging from there.

I am sure I am not the only one who must have faced this problem. There must be a solution to this.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The best way, I think, is situation specific.  In your case, create some format in which to hold your progress and save it/update it to a file as you progress.  Then, upon restart, some logic for determining whether to resume or restart.

Also, break up the program into stages that you can fake or skip?

To do otherwise would require an inefficient and doubtfully even possible memory/registry dump at "safe recovery points" and reload.  I think the closest thing implemented for that is whole-environment Virtualization with "snapshots" (VMWare Workstation, Windows Virtual PC?)  That could be an option, but it would be almost as slow.
