Many Java classes involves importing from other packages, including those from built-in packages such as java.awt and javax.swing for GUI programming, or using the classes from other packages from the same Java project.

I currently use the Eclipse IDE, and imports are done whenever they are needed. However, when I use a method that requires importing from another package, it only imports the relevant classes from that package. That makes it more difficult for me to manually manage the imports, as well as making the imported packages harder to read. I almost always make my code more compact by using the wildcard character * instead, to indicate that I would import all the classes from that package.

Here is a simple Java program which creates a JFrame containing a white JPanel with a JLabel and JButton. 

/* What I got */
import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.Dimension;

import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JLabel;
import javax.swing.JPanel;

/* Can be instead */
// import java.awt.*;
// import java.swing.*;

public class GUIframe extends JFrame {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public GUIframe() {
        super();

        this.setSize(new Dimension(400,400));
        this.setTitle("JFrame");

        JPanel panel = new JPanel();
        panel.setBackground(Color.WHITE);
        panel.add(new JLabel("JLabel"));
        panel.add(new JButton("Button"));

        this.getContentPane().add(panel);

        this.setVisible(true);
    }
}


I wonder what are the coding-style advantages of just importing individual classes from imported packages rather than importing all the classes through wildcard? (It is known that it generates the same bytecode, so no runtime performance difference and only minor compile-time difference)

As of now, I only choose wildcard import unless the number of class imports is very small, because it is easier to manage. When is it appropriate to individually import, and when is it appropriate when importing by wildcard?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There are no runtime performance differences. It mainly stems down to being able to understand what was used. 

You are right if you make use of, say 75% of the calls in a package it's probably best to import that entire package with wildcard. Whereas if you only make use of 1 or 2 out of 100 its easier to see what you're using.

Title: What files does a Spyder shortcut target?
Description: 
    
    
                    
This is assuming your OS is Windows.

If you:


right-click on a shortcut 
left-click "properties"   
left-click in the text field labeled "target"
press Ctrl-A then Ctrl-C to copy
open a text editor. press Ctrl-v to paste.


What paths do you get?

I installed Spyder using pip

I created a desktop shortcut manually, but chose the wrong executables. When I launch Spyder via the shortcut, the GUI is mostly just a big black rectangle. It does not work. The shortcut I made points to:

"D:\Program Files\Python36\pythonw.exe"
"D:\Program Files\Python36\Scripts\spyder3.exe"


I realize your drive letters, etc... might be different. It's just the .exes I care about.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I use the Anaconda3 installation, which automatically installs Spyder3 together with Python, and installed to my D: drive rather than the default location. With that in mind, I use the program menu item to open Spyder, which uses the command

D:\Anaconda3\pythonw.exe D:\Anaconda3\cwp.py D:\Anaconda3 D:\Anaconda3\pythonw.exe D:\Anaconda3\Scripts\spyder-script.py


This opens Spyder3 without any noticeable black box. You should be able to modify this to your needs, but first check to see if you already have a shortcut in your program menu structure. If not, consider installing Anaconda rather than the default Python installation. That solves many of the problems that come up when using Python in Windows and would solve your current problem as well.

I also set up Windows to open a .py file by loading it into Spyder. Soon after installing Anaconda with Spyder I double-clicked a .py file, and when the resulting dialog box asked me the program to use I pointed to

D:\Anaconda3\Scripts\spyder.exe


This opens a small black box, which eventually closes, with Spyder opening soon after with the file loaded in the editor. This then automatically happens whenever I double-click a .py file.

I believe the issue is the reuse of the function name as the return value name. I would simply delete the name of the return value, since you're not using it anyway:

function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint256) {


As an alternative, you can name it something different:

function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint256 total) {

    
    
Title: Xcode 9 font &amp; colors preferences not preserved after restarting

Answer 1: 

    
    
I cannot reproduce the problem you've described, the theme I created was preserved after killing and re-launching Xcode. Interestingly, my custom theme was moved to the bottom of the list, maybe that's the case for you as well.

If your theme legitimately went missing, it can be because of a software or a hardware bug/fault. What you can do is make a backup from your .xccolortheme file before quitting Xcode to make sure that it survives the relaunch.

For this, you should navigate to

~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/

and make a copy of the file you want to preserve. If it ever disappears, you can move the copy back to this location.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I could duplicate the xccolortheme file without a problem. The issue was permissions. It had the wrong permissions! What the deuce!
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I had this problem in Xcode 10. It was caused by the name I gave the theme: AI/ML. I headed to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/, the directory in which the themes are stored, as pointed to by Tamás Sengel.

In FontAndColorThemes, there was a directory named AI, containing the theme, with the name ML. I moved the theme one level up, deleted the directory, and renamed the theme file. I then had to restart Xcode again, to get the theme back on the list.

Xcode read / not as part of the name, but as a separator between a directory and the file. Xcode should've managed this situation, but as it doesn't, don't name your files this way; at least I won't.

As shown in the screenshot from a valid C/C++ include file the using directive is not shown in the Outline section:



How can I enable this?

My Eclipse version:


  Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers
  
  Version: Oxygen.2 Release (4.7.2)

Answer 1: 

    
    
First, note that the construct circled in your screenshot is not a "using directive".

There are three syntactic constructs in C++ that start with the keyword using:

using namespace std;   // using directive
using std::vector;     // using declaration
using myint = int;     // alias declaration; new in C++11


(An alias declaration can also be templated, in which case it's often called a "template alias".)

Eclipse CDT does show using directives and using declarations in the outline view.

Alias declarations are new in C++11, and Eclipse CDT does not yet support showing them in the outline view. Bug 509120 is on file
to track this.
    
    
Title: Intellij documentation popup hides warning popup

In the Intellij Settings I activated Editor &gt; General &gt; Show quick documentation on mouse move and I like it. But when there is a warning message also shown as popup when the mouse hovers over, then the documentation popup just hides the warning like this:


Well, that's not nice. Is there a way to solve that?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The are a couple of alternatives to displaying the quick documentation as a popup:


Display the quick documentation in a separate panel.
Display the quick documentation in a floating window. 


To display the quick documentation in a separate panel:


Position the mouse so that the quick documentation popup is displayed.
Click the Options icon in the bottom right of the popup.
Select Open as a Tool Window from the drop down menu.




After doing that the quick documentation popup is displayed in a panel on the right. It is still automatically updated as you move the mouse.



Alternatively, to display the quick documentation as a floating window:


Click the Options icon in the top right corner of the panel.
Select Windowed Mode from the drop down menu.




After doing that the quick documentation is shown as a floating window which you can position wherever you want. You could even place it on another screen if you have multiple screens. Again the content is still automatically updated as you move the mouse.



Select Open as a Popup from the Options drop down menu on the panel or the floating window (or press CTL/Q) to revert to using a popup for the quick documentation.

The best choice is a matter of personal taste, but both of those approaches would solve your overlapping popups problem.



Update:
The previous screen shots were produced using IDEA Ultimate 2018.1 EAP. With Ultimate 2017.3 it seems that the situation is slightly different. After clicking the Options icon, only a control to adjust the font is shown. In that case click the Pin icon in the top right of the window:

Title: Eclipse tabs closage within a project only
Description: 
    
    
                    
Most of time I work with more opened projects at once which results in the overcrowded and fuzzy set of opened cross-projects tabs at once. Suddenly I realize I have found what I need and I want to close all the tabs belonging to a project. Is there a way to comfortably close all the project related opened tabs without closing a project itself?

Example

I have opened two projects A and B. I would like to close all the clases under the B project only, i.e. (B1.java, B2.java ... B5.java). 



Why don't you want to close the whole project and open to get rid of these tabs?

I want to keep the project opened to see its structure and opened packages with their content. Although my example above is simple, let's assume I don't want to close the project and walk through a broadly branched tree to find a relevant package agian. The only I need is to close the currently opened tabs of the other project to be used soon or later.

Close them manually, huh?

Eclipse has an amazing feature that the each tab size is different based on the length of the class/file name - the closing of more of tabs at row is still about wasting time of finding the x button. The even more stupid is the expandable list on the right side of tabs which items have no x button at all so I can't close the tabs directly from it.



So, does exist a way?

The simple answer is no, this is not possiable. To close all the tabs you can:

Title: Is there any reason to prefer running an application from within IDE vs running stand alone executable?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I work with C++ integer programming routines in terms of developing faster specialized methods for difficult NP-Hard problems. I came across an earlier question that dealt more with getting different results when an application is launched from within an IDE (Visual Studio) versus running the built application from the command line without opening the IDE at all.

Differences between running an executable with Visual Studio debugger vs without debugger

This question is not about different results, but more about whether each option (running from within IDE vs running executable standalone) has any impact on computational time and performance. In my line of work, it is important to show that any specialized algorithm that we develop does much better in terms of computational time as compared to solving the integer program directly using a generic off the shelf solver such as CPLEX. Testing both these options (our specialized algorithm vs CPLEX directly) requires generating a linear/integer programming model from using CPLEX routines and libraries embedded within a C++ file.

Then, each setting is built from within Visual Studio (F7) and run (F5). Note that F7 itself generates the executable file.

To give each method (our specialized algorithm or CPLEX directly) the best chance to run with as fast computational time as possible, is it suggested to launch the application by pressing F5 within the IDE (Visual Studio, in this case), or it is better to run the application (generated by build F7) as an .exe without even opening the IDE? Assume that the working directory and intermediate files that are needed are accessed from the same folder for both options (IDE vs standalone .exe).

In other words, does IDE launch differ in any significant way from running the  .exe directly so as to have an impact on computational times of the application?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In Visual Studio, your program is run as a standalone process. Before starting you can choose Debug or Release version to run. The Release version has optimizations enabled.

When running within the IDE, VS is monitoring your application, so there might be some kind of overhead. You need to measure on your specific machine to find out how much.

With ctrl-f5 you can run your application outside the IDE.

Uninstall and install it again. It should have downloaded the Android SDK components while installing but it doesn't seem to be the case. Make sure your connected to the internet during the installation, and once the installation is completed, ensure that they have been downloaded by checking the default Android SDK location on MacOS. Then try opening Android Studio without needing to change any config.

By the time this question was made, there was no solution.
The OS requirements were Mac OS High Sierra up to 10.12. There was no Android Studio for Mac OS 10.13.

Currently there is a version that supports Mac OS 10.13.

Answer 1: 

    
    
gradle run isn't used for the Android project, try instead one of the assemble[Flavor] tasks. To "install and run" an apk into an emulator or Android device, there are 3 steps:

1) Create the apk.
For example, first you will have to run:

$ ./gradlew clean assembleDebug


That's going to generate an apk file, and I'll assume the apk generated is named app-debug.apk.

2) Install the generated apk in your device or emulator:

$ adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk 


If you had adb installed and a running emulator or a connected device the output should be "Success". The -r option is used if you already have the same apk installed, you could learn more about other adb install options.

3) "Run" your app in your emulator or device:

$ adb shell am start -n "android.kotlin.dur.bounceme.net.helloandroid/android.kotlin.dur.bounceme.net.helloandroid.MainActivity" -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER


I'm assuming your Launcher is your MainActivity, you could change that in the AndroidManifest.xml, and you will need the package name as well.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can see

gradle installDebug


which installs the app onto the device. You still need to run it as described by @moxi: $ adb shell am start -n "android.kotlin.dur.bounceme.net.helloandroid/android.kotlin.dur.bounceme.net.helloandroid.MainActivity" -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER If you have some tests, you could also use

gradle connectedAndroidTest


which starts the app to run the tests.
    
    
Title: How to get Dev C++ to find Python.h
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Dev C++. Include Python.h doesnt work, and IDE states it cant find the file or directory. I can pull up the Python.h C file, so I know I have it. How do I connect two-and-two? I imagine I have to tell my IDE where the file path is, but how would I do that?

Title: Debug.Assert() isn&#39;t thrown
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have the following code:



As you can see from the quickview tooltip, nNewCell.Style is Nothing.
Despite of that, the lines

Debug.Assert(nNewCell.Style IsNot Nothing)
Debug.Assert(nNewCell.Style.GUID &lt;&gt; "")


aren't thrown.

The IDE doesn't raise an exception or stop there, the IDE simply ignores these lines.

My project settings are Debug x86.

What might be causing this problem?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Project Properties ➤ Compile ➤ Advanced Compile Options

You will see a checkbox for Define DEBUG constant. This must be checked for Debug functions to work. If it's not, they will be ignored and not compiled into your assembly.



This definitely seems like you are missing the DEBUG constant because your code should be throwing a NullReferenceException due to the line Debug.Assert(nNewCell.Style.GUID &lt;&gt; "") and your screenshot showing it was Nothing. 



One quick note. This issue really simple to cause and I have lost a decent amount of time before tracking down issues related to this. When creating a new configuration, always copy the appropriate type (Debug or Release). Issues like this are usually caused by copying a Release or non-debug config, but then attempting to treat them as Debug.
    
    
Title: What the color of methods means in PhpStorm?
Description: 
    
    
                    


What's the difference between those 'purple' methods and 'green' methods? I've checked IDE settings throughout but in vain, really confusing...
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
That is a IDE bug that is not able to recognize methods of the Blueprint. Green should stand for a method of a class while purple indicates a property of a class (e.g. public $property inside a Class).
    
    
Title: Visual Studio 2015 - How to Preserve Indentation of Comments?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Simple question. No answer given anywhere on the internet? 

I program in C++ / C# in VS2015 community. When i comment out code and then close the ide and reopen it, this commented code loses indentation. How do i force VS to preserve indentation? It shouldn't be doing anything to the code / text that is commented. Thanks in advance.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In VS 2017 (C++) there is a checkbox for this.

Tools | Options | Text  Editor | C/C++ | Formatting | Indentation | Preserve indentation of comments

Unchecking it fixed annoying comment auto-formatting. Maybe the same option exists in VS 2015.
    
    
Title: How to change indentation rules in SublimeText3?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In my company, we are all working on Sublime and my boss want us to have a specific indentation for js and php files. He wants us to indent the closing curly braces at the same indentation as the code above. (If found that it's named Ratliff style) Here is an example.

function resetScraperSubmit() {
    var button = $('.modal#scrapperConfiguration').find('button[type=submit]');
    button.text(button.data('default-text'))
        .addClass('btn-primary')
        .removeClass('btn-danger')
        .prop('disabled', false);
    }


To do this, I have to indent myself all of them all the time.

Is there any feature/configuration file in Sublime or in one of his plugin to automatically do this ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Hi You can customise you sublime indentation settings from the settings tab 

Preferences -&gt;  Settings


Copy the rules that you want to customise from the default settings window wich most if the time appears at the left side and paste it to the right hand side  and change the value 

"detect_indentation": true,
"auto_indent": true,
"auto_indent": true, 
"indent_to_bracket": false,


And so on 
Here is the Sublime Indentation Manual Read it and follow the rules 
    
    
Title: WebStorm Emmet outputting tags as HTML entities
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using Emmet in WebStorm.

The output of this line:

ul#nav&gt;li.item$*4&gt;a{Item $}


Must be:

&lt;ul id="nav"&gt;
    &lt;li class="item1"&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Item 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="item2"&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Item 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="item3"&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Item 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="item4"&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Item 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


Instead, this is what I am getting:

&amp;lt;ul id="nav"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

Change the phpstorm settings to use port 10000 for xdebug connections: 



Stop/start listening for php debug connections to take it effect:



If you still get "port busy" error, you can check what's blocking the port by running lsof -i tcp:10000 inside "terminal" (assuming you have OSX ElCapitan+). 

PS: I also have xdebug.idekey=PHPSTORM in my xdebug.ini, phpstorm might ingore the connection without this after you resolve your port issue.
    
    
Title: Delphi 10.1 doesn&#39;t find the units added with an installed package
Description: 
    
    
                    
I use Delphi 10.1 Berlin Starter and have the following problem:

Is added some packages by opening them, and installing them by right-clicking on the package in the project manager and choosing "install". The compiled packages are now in the same folder as the other packages Delphi uses, so I think that there cannot be a problem with the library or search path.

The packages also added some Components that are now accessible in the tool palette. If I add one of these components to my program, Delphi automatically adds the unit name of the component to the "uses" section of the unit containing the component. But if I want to compile, Delphi throws the fatal error "could not find unit_name.pas".

How can I fix this? Does the units required to build and install the packages have to be included in a library path?

Maybe this is a compatibility problem. The packages were written in 2008 (Are Namespaces in Delphi younger?), so maybe the way the package wants to tell the compiler what to do does not work anymore.

This question might be difficult to understand (I had some problems to explain it...), so please comment, if you need more information.

Now: if I add a new ViewController to the Storyboard (and to the tab controller, of course), I must provide a title for its name to show on the left.

Strangely enough, I can't see any title for the First and Second ViewController (default).

Title: Trick to run different pre/post build events when building with MSBuild or from Visual Studio IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
Don't ask me why, but does anyone know any trick to put in the pre/post build event command that will run different commands if the project is being built from command line with MSBuild or from inside the Visual Studio IDE?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The easiest solution would be to define build targets that are conditioned on the $(BuildingInVisualStudio) property that visual studio sets to true when buildinging.

&lt;Target Name="SpecialPreBuild" BeforeTargets="BeforeBuild" Condition="'$(BuildingInVisualStudio)' != 'true'"&gt;
  &lt;Exec Command="some-command.exe --magic" /&gt;
  &lt;Copy SourceFiles="foo.txt" DestinationFolder="bin\$(Configuration)\bar" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;

&lt;Target Name="SpecialPostBuild" AfterTargets="AfterBuild" Condition="'$(BuildingInVisualStudio)' != 'true'"&gt;
  &lt;Exec Command="some-other-command.exe --magic" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;


If you want to skip these targets in other IDEs / editors as well, you could introduce a custom property as well and change the Condition attributes above to

Condition="'$(PerformSpecialLogic)' == 'true'"


That way no "default" builds will execute these targets and you could build with the following arguments in your build script / CI definition:

msbuild /p:PerformSpecialLogic=true

I am working on an Angular 2 application and use IntelliJ IDEA for development. I like the feature of showing unused variables. However, if a function is used in component HTML, the component typescript files still say the function is unused. Is there any configuration to avoid this? It is very frustrating as I don't like to see unused variables or functions and if I accidentally delete them, they are not detectable until run time since this is JS.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I want to import qemu project version 2.9.0 to Eclipse CDT (NEON) for modify the code. I used to import it as an Autotools project but it has a lot of missing define tag and header file that preprocessor cannot find. Are there any tutorials or explanation about that. thanks

Or should I change to the another IDE?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I would suggest the following:


Run the configure script from a terminal
Assuming that generates a makefile, Build the project from Eclipse. This will invoke "make all" (you can adjust the target name in the project settings if necessary).


CDT has a "build output parser" that will parse the build commands contained in the make output, and configure your project's includes and defines accordingly.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
qemu doesn't use autotools (the configure script is hand-written not autoconf-generated).
    
    
Title: Make PhpStorm change it&#39;s opinion about return value of framework function
Description: 
    
    
                    
I use PhpStorm. Given a framework function or method, for example, auth()-&gt;user(), I need to change PhpStorm's opinion about it's return value's type.

In my case, this function is a part of Laravel framework and it returns an instance implementing Authenticatable interface. I have a User class which implements this interface and in all cases auth()-&gt;user() returns User instance.

User contains some methods and properties I'd surely like to see autocompleted by PhpStorm when I type auth()-&gt;user(), but it's not autocompleted since PhpStorm is only sure about Authenticatable nature of it's return value.

Changing framework's source code in vendor/ is not acceptable since any patch would rewrite it, and I'd have to do it on every machine.

I've found out one could create a PhpStorm extension, but it's excessive, I guess. I could create some kind of IDE helper file, but I don't know how and don't know if it's the correct decision.

What is the best/correct/appropriate solution for this problem? Am I missing something?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you assert type of the returned value, PHPStorm will be happy:

$user = auth()-&gt;user();
if ($user instanceof User) {
    // starting from this point PHPStorm should hint User's methods for $user.
}

    
    
Title: How can I execute simple interactive program in spyder?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I wrote typical guess-number game:

import random
secret = random.randint(1, 99) 
guess = 0
tries = 0
print("Hey you on board! I am the dreadfull pirat Robert, and I have a 
secret!")
print("that is a magic number from 1 to 99. I give you 6 tries.")
while guess != secret &amp; tries &lt; 6:
    guess = input()
    if guess &lt; secret:
        print("You! Son of a Biscuit Eater! It is too little! YOU Scurvy dog!")
    elif guess &gt; secret:
        print("Yo-ho-ho! It is generous, right? BUT it is still wrong! The 
number is too large, Savvy? Shiver me timbers!")   
    tires = tries + 1
if guess == secret:
    print("Enough! You guessed it! Now you know my secret and I can have a peaceful life. Take my ship, and be new captain")
else:
    print("You are not lucky enough to live! You do not have ties. But before you walk the plank...")
    print("The number was ", secret)
    print("Sorry pal! This number became actually you death punishment. Dead men tell no tales! Yo Ho Ho!")


However spyder executes it all without a stop for inputing number by a user and I have got just this output:


  Hey you on board! I am the dreadfull pirat Roberth, and I have a secret!
  that is a magic number from 1 to 99. I give you 6 tries.
  You are not lucky enough to live! You do not have ties. But before you walk the plank...
  The number was  56
  Sorry pal! This number became actually you death punishment. Dead men tell no tales! Yo Ho Ho!


I tried to call cmd -/pblockquotep/p/blockquotep/pp/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
Couple of issues with your code, in the tires=tries+1 you've probably made a code typo. 

Second, guess reads in a string so you will need to convert guess into an int to do integer comparisons, use something like guess=int(guess).

The reason you aren't seeing this is because your condition in the while loop does not execute as true, run guess != secret &amp; tries &lt; 6 in the interpreter and you'll see that the condition is false. 

Instead you should use and as this is a logical operator the &amp; is a bitwise logical operator (they are not the same). 

while  guess != secret and tries &lt; 6: is the appropriate line of code you should substitute.

I'd like to make it more convenient so that it would be a button opening a popup with 2 inputs: comment and tag. The corresponding parts of the command from above would be populated from the popup's inputs and then the command would be executed.

Do you guys know if this is possible in PhpStorm?

I know PhpStorm offers some git GUI, but it doesn't seem usable to me. Multiple complex dialog etc, whereas I only want to push all the changes assigning a tag, that's why the custom popup needed.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Note that you can achieve a similar convenient use case even without the use of "External tool" in your IDE, but simply through a script.

If that script is called git-xxx (for instance git-actp, for add-commit-tag and push), it can be a simple bash script:

#!/bin/bash
tag=$1
shift
comment="$@"
git add --all
git commit -m "${comment}"
git tag -a ${tag} -m "${comment}"
git push


If that script is anywhere in your $PATH or %PATH% (it works on Windows too), you can call it with:

git actp v1.4.0 my comment with multiple words

Try this package of eclipse. In macOS High Sierra works fine. But the problem is gdb does not work well for the debugging in mac. 
An alternative IDE is CLION for C++ which is free for the students. You will have perfect debugger using LLDB. Note that you need to prepare Cmake if you use CLION.
    
    
Title: How can I see all method called by a method in a Eclipse, and all their called methods
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Eclipse, I know how to find all the method that call my method - with the call hierarchy.
Question:  Is there a way to do the reverse?  

The method A calls method B, C and D
method B calls C, E, F
method C calls X, Y and Z
method D calls X, F and Z
etc ....


Is there a way to get that tree view in eclipse, somehow?
Or is there any other tool ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The "Call Hierarchy" view of Eclipse can show trees of both directions:


Show caller hierarchy (all methods calling a method)


Show callee hierarchy (all methods called by a method)



    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can also add a breakpoint in the method you want the calls for and look at the callstack in the debugger when you hit that breakpoint. This is probably not as good as @Thomas Fritsch's answer but it will yield some information and works in many debuggers.
    
    
Title: How to improve performance of Pycharm documentation fetch
Description: 
    
    
                    
When I'm hovering over some Python method in Pycharm, the "quick documentation" window appears instantly, but it will still be fetching documentation for a few seconds before the document appears.

How do I get the documentation to appear instantly without the fetch delays?

I have experienced this issue before in Android Studio (which is a modified version of IntelliJ IDEA) and managed to solve it with the help of this thread: Android Studio quick documentation always &quot;fetching documentation&quot;.

Instead of getting Android Studios to fetch the information online each time quick docs appears, the answers suggested downloading all the documentation for Android in a package called the Android SDK Documentation and referring IntelliJ IDEA to that package. In Android Studios, this not only works with the core Android methods but also any library that gets imported into your project.

Can I do something similar in Pycharm?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you want reduce the delay of the quick documentation, you can go to:

Settings-&gt;Editor-&gt;General


In this window, search and enable (if it is not) the option:

Show quick documentation on mouse move


Now the Delay option should be enabled, so you can set the value that you prefer. 
Remember that is in milliseconds.

Let me know.
    
    
Title: Selenium IDE If DIV contains Text click on the button
Description: 
    
    
                    
I try to click on &lt;button&gt; element that is child of &lt;div&gt;. The &lt;div&gt; also contains &lt;span&gt; element with certain text that I stored some steps before. I have lots of elements that have the structure below, but only one of them contains the exact text in the &lt;span&gt;. Based on the text in this &lt;span&gt; I want to click on the &lt;button&gt; above.

The structure of the HTML:

&lt;td&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;button&gt; Click &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;span&gt; From ORI-1730 &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;


I am selecting the span this way: 

(css=span:contains("${SelectOrder}")) 


where "SelectOrder" == From ORI-1730. 

And tried to select the button with:

(css=span:contains("${SelectOrder}").prev()) 


without success.

I have found some themes, but was unable to make them work for me:

Jquery: Checking to see if div contains text, then action

Select previous element using jQuery selector only
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can select required button by using XPath instead of CSS, like below:

xpath=//div[span[contains(text(), "${SelectOrder}")]]/button

    
    
Title: Eclipse static import content assist doesn&#39;t work
Description: 
    
    
                    
I would like to configure my Eclipse to suggest me static methods of a LazyModel java type when I type them. And to add an appropriate static import of course. 

I have enabled using static imports in general Content Assist settings



And I have added the LazyModel type to Content Assist Favorites.



But the Eclipse doesn't suggest me the LazyModel's static methods.
Note that:


for java.util.stream.Collectors it works perfectly
the LazyModel type is from maven dependency
I have tryied to delete all Eclipse's indexes


Any idea what am I missing here?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Not exactly what I was looking for, but if I add all LazyModel static methods as members instead of the whole LazyModel type to the Favorites, then it works.
    
    
Title: How to make PyDev Debug Console Interactive?
Description: 
    
    
                    
PyDev offers both a debug console as well as an interactive console. However, I am still not able to execute interactive commands such as %timeit in the debug console. 

How can I make the debug console interactive?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can't currently make the debug console an IPython interactive console -- you can have a "regular" interactive console by right-clicking a stack-frame in the Debug view &gt; PyDev &gt; Debug Console, but it's not really an interactive console with IPython support.

Starting an IPython session in the context of a breakpoint could end up having side effects that could break your debug session, so, it wasn't implemented -- although in practice, there's probably nothing stopping anyone from implementing it (the only thing is that there should probably be a preference so that users could opt out of it and the time and willingness to actually implement it).

Another option is turn things the other way around. Start an interactive console and have a debugger attached to it -- go to window &gt; preferences &gt; PyDev &gt; Interactive Console and check Connect console to Debug Session?

See: http://www.pydev.org/manual_adv_interactive_console.html#full-debug-support-in-interactive-console for more details.
