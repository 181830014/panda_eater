Title: Can I quickly dial up font sizes for the VS IDE without a mouse?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Maybe this isn't a "programming question" per se, but it relates to the coding process:

One of the really neat features I like about the WPF-ized VS IDE is being able to hit Ctrl (I think it is) and thumb the mouse wheel to quickly change font size in the code editor.

For work (desktop PC) that works great, but at home, on my laptop, I can't figure out how to accomplish it (other than going into Properties or whatever and changing font size there, which is obviously way less "handy" (no pun intended)).

Is there a quick way to change edit font size without resorting to the dialog accessed via the menu?

Title: Eclipse/JUnit &ldquo;Test class not found&rdquo; when subclassing BlockJUnit4ClassRunner
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am trying to subclass BlockJUnit4ClassRunner, in order to be able to use 
this nice parameterizing framework: JUnitParams.

I can't use the built-in JUnit parameterizing runner, since I need to do some additional work in the runner.
Anyway, eclipse will run the tests, but when trying to double-click the JUnit display in order to jump to the test code, it prompts a "Test class not found in selected project" error.

Does anyone happen to know where in the Runner code can I set the connection between the JUnit plugin and the code?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'm the author of 'this nice parameterizing framework' ;-)  

The problem (which is also in JUnitParams) is that eclipse uses the junit's Description class when jumping to a test method, but in order to show the tree with all parameters in the junit results view I need to cheat a bit and enter parameters as a method name and method name as a class name, hence the problem.  

If you need this feature, change getDescription method in your runner so that it works like the original one (but you'll loose the nice view of which param set failed.)

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm an existing C# (ASP.NET MVC 3 years +), C++, Javascript developer, and have done a bit of Python development in my time.

I'm looking to take on a Google App Engine Python project and essentially I feel a bit lost without a decent integrated IDE experience + Data Management tool with GUI. Is GAE just for hardcore developers that can code right first time, in vim? I feel like I'm wasting time on things that could honestly code in 5 mins in a more Established framework.

I'm currently using the Eclipse plugin, and trying to view all the elements in an array while paused. I'm drilling into objects, but can't seem to find the list.

Is this just something that can't be done with App Engine at the moment, if so please do help me!

Get the python plugin for google app engine from http://pydev.org/. It supportS direct deployment to appengine from eclipse. It's one of the best environment for the ones from C#,.NET. It even has autocomplete and lot more........

I use Wing IDE Pro and it's the best python ide I've ever used by far. I use VS 2010 Ultimate for C#, so for me to feel comfortable and efficient in Wing says a lot concerning its quality for writing python. For GAE specifically, Wing supports debugging locally. 
    
    
Title: CoffeeScript IDE for Windows - tried Titanium Studio and RubyMine
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to find a good way to work on CoffeeScript on Windows and be able to process these files quickly to JavaScript in the IDE.

RubyMine - if I just open a .coffee file in RubyMine this seems to work. But I see no button or menu option to convert to JavaScript.

Titanium Studio - in this IDE there is a Menu option to do the conversion - but when used it seems to call out to gitbash on my machine. At least that is what shows up in the console in the IDE.

So I'd like to get one or both of these to work on Windows... or get an alternate suggestion for a good CoffeeScript IDE with the translation process built-in.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
RubyMine relies on Rails framework for CoffeeScript to JavaScript compilation at the moment.

Cutting edge CoffeeScript support is available in PhpStorm/WebStorm products, in the EAP versions to be released by the end of 2011. You can download and try them at http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/WI/Web+IDE+EAP.

Watch the issue for progress.

Latest version has an action to compile CoffeeScript, but it just displays a window with the result without writing any files (Help | Find Action | Compile Coffeescript File, or bind it to keyboard shortcut in Settings | Keymap).

Note that it's still work in progress, more features will be available soon. At the moment you can probably set up compilation using command line external tools.

Title: Visual Studio 2010 suddenly slow
Description: 
    
    
                    
Recently, the editor for VS2010 suddenly became slow when I installed some extensions then uninstalled them.  The program itself is running fine and starts up in seconds.  Jumping around the menus is lightning fast, but editing code, there is a 1 second lag between the keyboard and the editor.

This happens on a brand new console application project with nothing in it.  I have also uninstalled all extensions, resharper etc.  The only extensions remaining are VisualHg, Ankh and Nuget.

I have an i7 with 16 gigs of RAM so hardware is NOT the issue.

Is there some sort of cache or files that VS could have locked onto?

How can I figure out what is causing the issue?



Well thanks to @jv42's suggestion, I installed the perfwatson extension and that sorted out the issue.  I've since put some of the extensions back and VS2010 is running better than ever before.

I still don't know what caused the issue.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I would find a rollback point before you installed the plug ins.  You could have malware that installed with the plugin but was not part of the uninstall.  It could just be that the uninstall did not remove something it installed that was causing the problem.  It is most likely going to be far faster for you to find a rollback point and start there than to try and figure out what process is causing you the problem and where it is hooked into the registry.

Title: Can&#39;t Edit JFrame Form after NetBeansUpdate
Description: 
    
    
                    
Lately, I've been working on a project in NetBeans using the GUI editor that's built in. Before I noticed that it generated an XML ".form" file that didn't appear in the Project Explorer Pane which makes sense. Earlier I was working on the form in the "Design" tab when it notified me about 15 updates. I just updated without reading anything which was probably a bad idea but when I restarted the IDE, it showed my GUI ".class" file and ".form" file separately in the Project Explorer and I couldn't switch between "Source" and "Design". I also noticed that the generated code that was usually not editable was now editable.

P.S. I'm able to create a new frame just fine and the design editor still works with new frame
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I have encounter the same problem and I have solved it. 

The key in this problem, I think, is particular plugins for JFrame in Netbeans are not active after updating, so we only need to activate them. The easiest way to achieve this is create a new JFrame class, so in this progress, NetBeans can activate all relevant plugins for us. Finally, restart NetBeans, then everything would be fine.

Thank you very much for all of you that you give me some idea and clues in this situation:)

If you are trying to recover the lost state of the backing xml for the form I don't know what to tell you.

My team is planning to start development on linux platform. Previously we have been developing C++ applications in Windows using MS Visual Studio. And recently, I fell in love with Mac OSX and use it as my personal development machine.

The question is once again: Is it possible to use Xcode for Linux Development?

The applications we are building are real-time applications, which do not require fancy looking GUIs or advanced user interaction, the focus is on the performance.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As long as you stick to cross-platform interfaces (glibc, POSIX, STL, etc.), sure. You might need a Linux machine to actually build the binaries for Linux though.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I think it is possible since both xcode and linux are using gcc and could use similar development toolkits, and both osx and linux are unix based, therefore you can debug and code on osx, but I think you still need to recompile your apps on deployment O/S ( so make sure you're using portable codes between osx and linux)

Studio is built on top of PDT, so it can do everything that PDT can do.  It happens that the Zend Studio site has a feature comparison between it and PDT, showing where Studio's features are different.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Actually never, as Zend is pushing both products and one is commercial and one not. It will be a killer for ZendStudio to offer the same features as the PDT. Nevertheless PDT can be grown in features by the community, thus pushing Zend to improve more Zend Studio. And there is room for improvement...

I started using Zend Studio early this year, and do not regret it one bit.  Zend Studio is specifically built for dealing with many different PHP-specific scenarios with all the features of Eclipse.  My favorite feature is the ability to refactor code, enabling users to rename (or move) a variable, class, class method, or function across the entire application.  Zend Studio also has great debugging capability including code tracing, full integration with Zend Server, tunneling, MySQL perspective, in-app PHPUnit code coverage, and much more.

Title: Python 3.0 IDE - Komodo and Eclipse both flaky?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to find a decent IDE that supports Python 3.x, and offers code completion/in-built Pydocs viewer, Mercurial integration, and SSH/SFTP support.

Anyhow, I'm trying Pydev, and I open up a .py file, it's in the Pydev perspective and the Run As doesn't offer any options. It does when you start a Pydev project, but I don't want to start a project just to edit one single Python script, lol, I want to just open a .py file and have It Just Work...

Plan 2, I try Komodo 6 Alpha 2. I actually quite like Komodo, and it's nice and snappy, offers in-built Mercurial support, as well as in-built SSH support (although it lacks SSH HTTP Proxy support, which is slightly annoying).

However, for some reason, this refuses to pick up Python 3. In Edit-Preferences-Languages, there's two option, one for Python and Python3, but the Python3 one refuses to work, with either the official Python.org binaries, or ActiveState's own ActivePython 3. Of course, I can set the "Python" interpreter to the 3.1 binary, but that's an ugly hack and breaks Python 2.x support.

So, does anybody who uses an IDE for Python have any suggestions on either of these accounts, or can you recommend an alternate IDE for Python 3.0 development?

Cheers,
Victor

You did not mention these so I'm not sure if you've tried them but there are:
- Aptana (aptana.com)
- The Eric Python IDE (http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/)
- WingWare Python IDE (wingware.com)

I haven't used any of them so I don't know if they will match your needs, but I'd expected them to be pretty close as they are all mature.

As for PyCharm, I've been using it for a while and it's fine, actully I like it very much.
However I'm a Python noob and probably do not use many advanced features so YMMV.

I took a quick look at this.  It appears that the nbm file that you can download from the wiki page that you referenced is compiled against the trunk of the NB sources, not the bits that are released as NetBeans 6.8.

I have sent a note to the developer about this.

You can build the NBM yourself, but it is pretty painful, since you have to get the contrib repository.

This is embarrassing not able to use either the old version of TestNG or new version of TestNG in NetBeans. Any one kindly create a correct TestNG plugin for version 6.8.

Unfortunately, I don't think anyone has been working on the TestNG Netbeans plug-in in a while, so I'm not surprised to hear you are running into difficulties.  Try posting your question on their forums?

Otherwise, I continue to work actively on the Eclipse plug-in (new version released a few weeks ago) and TestNG is supported natively by IDEA...

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am just transitioning from Eclipse to Wing IDE for my Python code. In Eclipse I had an option to "rename" objects. I could take any object defined in my code, it could be a variable or a function or a method or whatever, and I could rename it automatically in all the files that referenced it.

Is there a similar feature in Wing IDE?

WingIDE 4 now has support for refactoring.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The refactoruing is a feature asked for since 2002, but even then, the answer was already:

"search and replace"


  BTW, one somewhat related thing we're doing is adding better global
  replace. [...] This isn't informed by source analysis but it's still a useful tool for some kinds of refactoring (like renaming poorly named variables or classes).


So their advanced search, even based on regex, is still the refactoring of the day for this 3.1.8 Wing IDE: as said in 2007, the 3.0, 3.1 releases were focused on debugging even though:


  Refactoring is in our plans for future releases.

Title: Finding compound word variable name spelling mistakes
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have just discovered a variable name that is misspelled.  If it were hidden away in the depths of code, that would be fine, but this variable name ends up in a configuration that is stored with visibility to the customer.  It's really not a big deal, but I wonder if there is a way to avoid it?

In this case the variable name is a compound word, which I won't reproduce here due to NDA, but imagine it was something like "confirmationRecieved" (the i and e are flipped).  Can anyone recommend a code spellchecker that would catch something like this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you are using Visual Studio, you can activate Code Analysis.

Code Analysis provides several means to validate you code, not only for typos or mispellings, but also for design and quality.

One of the default analysis is CA1704 : Identifiers should be spelled correctly.

If you're not using Visual Studio, but using .NET you can still use FxCop, which performs the same task as Code Analysis, without the IDE integration.

You can find more about Code Analysis here and about FxCop here.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The closest I have to detecting these problems is for function argument names. I use ReSharper with the AgentSmith plug-in. Then, I use GhostDoc to get a first pass at documentation. The AgentSmith plug-in will detect the spelling error. For example

void SomeFunction(int confirmationRecieved)
{
}


Turns into

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Somes the function.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="confirmationRecieved"&gt;The confirmation recieved.&lt;/param&gt;
void SomeFunction(int confirmationRecieved)
{
}


With a red squiggle under "recieved"
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Visual Studio has their Find and Replace tool which could easily be used to search through a selected portion of text, an entire document, or all the files of a project for a specific search string.

As far as an actual spellchecker that would somehow be able to understand compound words, I have never seen anything similar that wasn't custom developed.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
You haven't mentioned what IDE or platform you're using. However, if you're on Windows using Visual Studio, there is a great plugin called Visual Assist X which has a spellchecker built in. As far as I know, the spellchecker is intended for correcting spelling mistakes in comments and misspelled symbols (assuming you correctly spelled it the first time). To correct these misspellings, Visual Assist has a very useful feature called "Refactor" which allows you to change a variable/class/method name and it will automatically change all other occurrences of the name within its scope. Very handy when you misspell something or need to change a name globally.

It compiles fine with gcc 7.3 using the highest warning and pedantic options for C++17 [even it is not a C++17 feature].

Eclipse underlines wrapperMain and shows this error message:

I get an error every time I run my IDEA, seems like it is because I use 64 bit but running the IDEA of 32 bit. From what I've searched, it refers me to use idea64.exe, but where can I find it?


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
IntelliJ IDEA is now bundled with only 64-bit Java version. 32-bit JDK is not provided. If you install on the 32-bit system, there will be a checkbox in the installer to automatically download and configure 32-bit Runtime for IntelliJ IDEA.

Installer also has the options to create both 32-bit and 64-bit executable shortcuts. If you want to run 64-bit version, use IDEA_HOME\bin\idea64.exe.

Or you can just download this runtime version and unpack it into IDEA_HOME directory (so that you have IDEA_HOME\jre). Make sure to start IntelliJ IDEA with bin\idea.exe instead of bin\idea64.exe. This will start IntelliJ IDEA in 32-bit mode.

Another option is to download the .zip version for Windows, it has both 32-bit and 64-bit runtimes. Then you can use either bin\idea.exe or bin\idea64.exe to run (if you are on the 64-bit system):


    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
At least the answer to your question


  it refers me to use idea64.exe, but where can I find it?


is quite straightforward:

Under the folder you installed IntelliJ IDEA into, e.g.
C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA 2017.2\ there is a subfolder bin\ where you find idea64.exe
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
It is complaining because it cannot find a 32-bit JDK on your computer? Do you have the JDK installed?
If not, follow this official documentation or use this video. You will probably need to install the 32-bit version if you want to use the 32-bit IDE.

Did you get it ? is there a way to do that with Atom ?

This is implemented as "Preview Tabs" in the bundled "tabs" package in Atom. Go to Settings

Since Atom 1.6 this behavior is built in Atom itself, and does not rely on the tabs package or external ones. The "Use Preview Tabs" (as shown in accepted answer) is even not available anymore.

It is now called "Pending Pane Items" and is described in Atom 1.6 release announcement.


  Sometimes, it can be useful to take a peek at the contents of a file
  without opening it in a dedicated tab. For those instances, you want
  pending pane items.


Differences between now so called "Pending Pane Items" and ex "Preview tabs" have been also discussed on Atom's Discuss platform: Pending panes vs. preview tabs.

Pending pane items are now enabled by default, and there is no need to activate anything to use it. For those that do not like this behavior, it can be disabled from "Core Settings" by unchecking "Allow Pending Pane Items" setting:

I have a simplest way to add a landscape mode (add landscape folder, landscape xml file and code) in android studio. You just have to click one or two times to do that.
when you are in xml file opened look at the right there is a preview panel that show your device click the  button and click on switch to layout-land. It Automatically adds layout_land.xml file into your file structure AND also opens it in code &amp; preview.

Title: Code Behaving Differently On Different IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am writing a program that takes information about a track and field competition and then does some computation with it. The issue I'm having now is only in the first user input section.

I first wrote my code in BlueJ and it worked fine. Then, I tried compiling it in JCreator and started getting this error where the program would only receive 3 user inputs before going onto the next piece of code when it should have received 5 (which it did when I compiled in BlueJ).

When I placed a System.out.println statement after the input statement however, the program (in JCreator) DID receive all 5 statements before proceeding. When I commented it out again, it only received 3 statements before continuing. Here is the code below. 

    String[] events = new String[5];

    System.out.println("Please enter the 5 events in this competition.");
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; events.length; i++)
    {
        events[i] = input.nextLine();
        System.out.println(i);
    }


This is the output with the System.out.println statement.



This is the output with the System.out.println statement commented out.


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Change the line

events[i] = input.nextLine();


to

String newLine;
while( (newLine = input.nextLine()).isEmpty() );
events[i] = newLine;


That should consume the extra newline characters and leave you with just the legitimate input in events.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The possible cause of your problem is newline characters, which are interpreted as line. It seems you are having additional newline characters in your input buffer.

You may check your IDE what character is provided when an enter key is pressed.

It seems you are using Scanner class to read input. You may try to wrap your System.in with InputStreamReader, that might help. (not sure, try it out)

Scanner input = new Scanner(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
 events[i]=input.nextLine();

Instead you may also try to use BufferedReader to read the input.

BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
 events[i]=reader.readLine();

Hope it will help!!
    
    
Title: OCaml type-directed API search
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a type-directed search tool in OCaml (like Coq's SearchPattern command) where I can define a type constraint, e.g. _ * int -&gt; float, and then the tool will search a given set of files for "all functions mapping pairs whose second element is an integer to floats"?

Either a stand-alone tool, or something integrated into an IDE would be fine. The idea is that, when exploring a new API, if I want for instance to obtain a value of type Foo.t, looking for all functions of the form _ -&gt; Foo.t might be more efficient than browing the entire API.

Merlin helps finding the type of given expressions, but it has no such "API discovery" functions, as far as I know.

I found OcamlScope, but it seems to be a web-only service, and restricted to a set of fixed libraries. I wanted to be able to search my own files for existing functions.

ocamloscope's source can be found here https://github.com/camlspotter/ocamloscope/. You may succeed to use it locally. There's even an issue for making an OPAM package out of it.
