Title: Do any Python IDEs have support for type hinting or limited code completion for function arguments?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I like using IDEs when writing stuff in Python or other languages because modern features like call tips or code completion make things much easier. Since Python is a dynamically typed language there is, of course, no way to provide these features for variables such as function arguments. This causes the modern features to disappear, which results in everything being cumbersome and time consuming, because I usually have to reference class definitions to double check the correctness of what I'm accessing.

Are there any Python IDEs that have support for code completion by suggesting an expected type for a variable? For example, if variable x is expected to be a str class, I would like to be able to suggest that x's type is str and have code completion enabled for that class.

I read that PyDev might be able to do this, but I really don't want to use it because Eclipse. My preferred IDE is PyScripter, but I'm fairly certain that it can't do this.

Title: phpstorm autocomplete &amp; ctrl+click not recognising nested vars/methods
Description: 
    
    
                    


amrManager doc:




As you can see from the snip, phpstorm sees the methods/obj from the class instance but when accessing the next depth level of methods from the objects, it does not recognise them :( and this makes development really hard as I am coming from a Java background. When using the same code in Netbeans it recognised them as expected but not in phpstorm. 

Surely this can be set somehow but I can't find how.
Also I am using a Symfony project.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It all depends on how armManager field is declared and what PhpStorm knows about it. Best result will always be when proper PHPDoc comment will be used or when type can be figured from default value.

As we an see Ctrl + Q (View | Quick Documentation) shows that IDE does not know much about (what type) armManager (protected $armManager; does not tell much indeed).

Based on your code, adding this simple PHPDoc comment will resolve your issue (plus added benefit on self-documentation):

/** @var MyArmManagerClass Optional description here */
protected $armManager;


(use correct class name, of course)

Description: 
    
    
                    
I recently, download and use IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 12, Just for experience and it's amazing Dracula theme!

Now, I feel that my main problem is about Ctrl+Space function.

Previously i used Netbeans, Lets say by a example:

In netBeans, When you write sy and enter Ctrl+Space , it show System to you,

But

In IntelliJ IDEA ,When you write sy and enter Ctrl+Space, It does not show System to you

Thus

You should write Sy and enter Ctrl+Space to show System to you.

Is there any solution to solve this wasting time problem?

Title: webstorm: typescript bool vs. boolean
Description: 
    
    
                    
Webstorm does not recognize some typescript types. I changed the compiler to be Microsoft's in order to get better compiler error (had random 'empty string' messages with the first one):

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript\tsc.exe

Now it gives me better compiler errors.
However the color coding of errors is still incorrect.

For example, though the type bool was changed to boolean long ago (https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/135) it does not recognize boolean.

Any ideas how to solve that?

I'm downloading Microsoft Studio Express right now but would prefer to stick with WebStorm.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Webstorm language service currently only works with 0.8.x, 

The  typescript language service inside WebStrom does not understand the changes made in 0.9.x, and since the TypeScript language service api changed (for the better imho) from 0.8 to 0.9 its not a drop in replacement. 

A new version of WebStorm with these features is on the way though (should be soon).

There is a way to execute a part of code ONLY if the application is launched from the IDE?.

I want to make a conditional where if application is launched from the VS IDE then do one thing but if application is launched manually from the compilation (from windows explorer, clicking in the compiled app, etc...) then do other thing.

This is possible?

Something like this, but changing #Debug to (Unknown thing...) :

Public Class Form2

    Private Sub Form2_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
#If DEBUG Then
        Me.Location = New Point(Form1.Right, Form1.Top)
#Else
        Dim BorderWidth = (Me.Width - Me.ClientSize.Width)
        Me.Location = New Point((Form1.Location.X + (Form1.Width + BorderWidth)), Form1.Location.Y)
#End If
    End Sub

Answer 1: 

    
    
What you really want to do is detect if there is a debugger attached to your application's process.

To do that, test the value of the System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached property. If it returns true, then a debugger is attached.

Of course, you can have a debugger other than Visual Studio attached to the process and that will still cause IsAttached to return true. And you can start an application from Visual Studio without the debugger attached (usually by pressing Ctrl+F5), and that will cause IsAttached to return false. But chances are good that whatever code you conditionally execute should run in all cases that a debugger is attached, and should not run whenever a debugger is not attached, regardless of which debugger it is.

Note that this is different from #If DEBUG, since that tests whether you're running a Debug build of the application. Debug builds have nothing to do with whether a debugger is attached. You can have a Debug build without the debugger attached, or attach a debugger to the Release build.

But, I really don't recommend using this for what you propose in the question. How will you debug problems with window placement if you're doing it differently each time a debugger is attached? 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Add a command line switch to enable the extra feature, and pass that in from Visual Studio via the Debugging settings?

Or use System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached.

Title: Is there a tool for automatic conversion of header into cpp and hpp files?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a (possibly bad) habit of coding everything into a monolithic header file when trying out ideas, placing all implementation code with the class definitions. As the code expands, it becomes difficult to navigate the file. Therefore, I refactor the code into separate files and split the implementation details (cpp files) from the interface (hpp files).

The laborious copy / pasting involved seems like a job for a machine. Are there any simple tools available for this task?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can try Lazy C++, as stated in this question.

You can also use a standard IDE, and move each function from header to source (for Visual Studio you can use Visual Assist, I think Eclipse can do it straight), generally it's like right click 
Answer 2: 

    
    
This kind of thing is quite common. My approach is to only cut and paste once: make a copy of the original file, then chop stuff from the header and chop other stuff from the source file.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I just created a project, and I notice immediately that I can't seem to right-click on my src folder and create a logical file group/folder within the project view.  

In many IDEs, I can arbitrarily organize source files in groups/folders.  These grouping help me organize my business process and data access layers appropriately.

How do I do the same in IntelliJ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'm not sure what the exact equivalent to what you're thinking is, or if there even is one.

IntelliJ has a notion of "scopes".  Under the Project/navigation view, click the configure dropdown and choose "Edit Scopes...".  From this window, you can define a pattern to include certain files from your project.

For instance, all of my DAOs are in packages called my.company.&lt;feature&gt;.persistence.  I create a scope called "DAOs" with the pattern src[myProject]:my.company.*.persistence.*.  Now when I choose "DAOs" from the Project view dropdown, I see a filtered view of the project.  I haven't found a way to show that filtered view alongside other scopes at the same time, however.

These scopes can also be shared, and they can be used to narrow down searches.  They are similar in many ways to Eclipse's working sets.

Many scopes are defined implicitly, like Test and Production, Changed Files, VCS changesets, etc.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I implemented two menu items for my component in Delphi IDE with TComponentEditor descendant. They're both supposed to be used with "right-clicking" a component on the form. But can I do this for component that is currently hidden (concealed) by other components? So I select a component with other tools (for example object inspector) and would like to activate one of my context menu items. 

Shift-F10 doesn't work (at least in D5). 

Bringing the component to top for this task is not an option.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Why are not we using, instead of the actual packages/libraries concepts, a centralized function database? I can see many advantages.


Easier to grow (anyone could send his small functions, as oposed to the work necessary to sustain a big 
Analyzable. Statisticals and graph theory tools could be used to analyze and categorize the database.
Ultimate productivity tool. Suppose you have the task of converting all images in a folder to black-and-white. You could google to search and install image manipulation and os packages for your language, then study then and search for the right functions. The whole process could take a day. Or you could search for an "open images files in a folder" function, a "convert images to black/white" function, and a "save image" function on said global database, and the whole process could take a minute. Now generalize this to any programming task and you can figure out why I find this so important.


Why is this concept not adopted?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It's an interesting idea.  I think the crux of the matter is this: a well-designed library (or set of libraries) is coherent, in that it carefully chooses a small set of functions, datastructures, and other conventions.  This is what lets programmers understand, use, and reuse it.

A massive function database seems like an attempt to make an incoherent, undesigned mass of functions reusable in the same sense.  But I don't think the hard part of the problem is finding relevant functions in the first place:  I'm afraid it's the sheer combinatorial explosion of arbitrary technical choices (inherent even in moderately simple tasks) that will defeat most attempts at direct reuse (as opposed to pseudocode-like inspiration).

Take your "open images in a folder" example query, and consider how a possible target function might:


identify the folder: directory handle, string, or one of a dozen "path" datastructures
choose a particular image: string, pattern match, or one of many interactive UI options
handle image formats: e.g., GIF, JPG, PNG, or a variety of polyglot image loader frameworks
load the image: unconditionally, header/metadata then body, by tile, by row, or something else
represent the image: what datastructure does it use to store the loaded image?
use exceptions, errors, or intermediate decision points


Some of these possibilities can be readily handled by the programmer (assuming the function is properly documented).  Some may be patchable (e.g., by finding another function to translate from the framebuffer format provided to one you can use).  But others have heavyweight technical implications.  An interactive UI file chooser will require the use of a particular UI framework.  A polyglot image loader function can pull in dozens of image libraries, and commit you to its memory management scheme.

To put it another way: "design for reuse" has been the hopeful motto of the software engineer for decades, and our best efforts have met with only modest success.  However, long experience has taught us the lesson implicit in the motto: without the "design" part, "reuse" doesn't stand a chance.

Thanks!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't think there is any all-in-one solution for that (yet). You need to combine several tools:


IDE: WebStorm, Aptana, or even Notepad++
Cross-Compiler: Sass, CoffeeScript etc.
Compressor: Google Closure Compiler, UglifyJS or YUICompressor
Build tool triggering a build process, managing folder structures etc.
Personally, I use loads of Bash scripts, but I've seen people use Maven or Ant  
There are also Frameworks with integrated build tools, supporting dev/production mode, something like qooxdoo, Sencha, ...


If you're on a small to medium-sized project, running the tools manually might be the best solution in terms of cost-benefit ratio, since automation requires quite a bit of work.

Title: Understanding Git, working with a php ide and ftp
Description: 
    
    
                    
In my past projects I have failed to invest time in setting up my workspace correctly.

For backups + version control I simply copy my webdirectory files to a separate folder on my hard-disk, if I find I have made a mistake somewhere, I reload a previous backup and start again from that point, often wasting precious time repeating work I have already done.

My IDE has no ftp functionality, I have to manually copy the files from my desktop to my webserver, constantly overwriting files and duplicating.

I am certain there is a better, more efficient way of doing the above. I have read about Git for version control and know I should be using it.

What is the suggested way to work efficiently (OS is Windows) with an IDE, version control and FTP that will save me sweat, tears and data loss?

EDIT: I am currently using netbeans IDE
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Here's how my setup works - this may or may not be feasible for you, but I hope it helps somehow. I no longer use FTP for anything.

You should get a DVCS setup, and which one you choose is entirely up to you. Any of them will be better than manually copying or not having anything at all. I suggest taking a look at both Git and Mercurial and making a decision from there. In my opinion, if you're using Windows primarily, Mercurial might be a better choice. If not, I'd say go for Git. You could always try both!

I setup a gitolite server which acts as a central repository for all of my git projects. It is great to have a remote central repository because your entire codebase is backed up in the case that your workstation should fail - and on top of that, you can use it to do some code coordination to move your files around (and stop using FTP).

Once that is setup, I start the process of pulling and pushing to it - you talk about your IDE here, and there are a lot of Git IDE options, but I just use the command line - I just find it faster. Again, up to you on how to incorporate that.

In terms of web development, I setup my gitolite server to use git-hooks to propagate changes to my servers. They all have the git client installed, so the codebase is usually in the webroot. When a change is pushed from my workstation to the gitolite server, it fires off some commands that automatically updates the production server. Not only is it convenient, but it also puts a copy of the codebase and its versions on your servers as well. Be careful with this though; you need to make sure you aren't sharing your /.git directory.

The basic idea is to improve your development ecosystem. My Git setup is perfect for that. You might need to assess your entire workflow and make adjustments based on your needs.

Here's the git plugin for NetBeans. I suggest using the command line when you get started, though.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Version control - when used properly - is much better than simply copying files around. In a single user environment, version control allows you to have fine-grain control over your versioning, often in a way that is more space efficient than full file copies because the old versions are stored as diffs.

In a multi-developer environment, version control provides the same benefits, but you also have to consider the case when multiple people edit the same file at the same time. In the simplest case, two people edit the same file in different places and you can safely take both modifications in sequence. In more complex cases, two or more developers make changes to the same region of code and it needs to be manually merged.

Git is different from traditional revision control systems in that it was designed to be used in a distributed fashion. That is - each developer has their own repository, and merges happen when they need to happen. You can have an authoritative central server if you want one, but you don't need to make very commit to that server all the time. This makes git particularly suitable to individual or remote development. Git doesn't require a heavy server on your desktop, just one small binary.

Title: Emacs inside of gedit?
Description: 
    
    
                    
After years of experimentation with editors, the fact is I prefer them as minimal as possible. I never use fancy features and the full-feature IDE's become bloated, heavy, and slow. Of course, when I do something that pretty much requires a specific IDE (like Android dev and Eclipse) I have no problems using it. But most of the time, I use gedit for programming.

However, I like many Emacs commands, and I want to use them occasionally. Is there a way to embed Emacs inside of gedit? For instance, I envision pressing alt-q (or whatever combo) and Emacs mode is enabled, and from then on all my key presses in the current tab do Emacs commands. I press alt-q again, and it turns off. This would allow me the best of both worlds. Anything like this exist, or do I need to write this plugin myself?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
No.

I've seen discussion of embedding of Emacs in other applications in the past, and the consensus is that even that's not feasible, let alone what you're suggesting.

You'd be better off identifying what gedit does that makes you want to use it instead of Emacs, and extending Emacs to make it do that, too.  (There can't be that much --- gedit doesn't do much.)  The extra features can just sit there and wait for you, and you'll find it easier to locate and use them if you're comfortable in Emacs-mode already.

(On top of all the other advantages of Emacs, you gain the ability to use the same editor you use in a windowed environment on the terminal --- a huge advantage.)

Or maybe yes . . .

You can use the External Tools plugin of gedit (look for it in Preferences).  Add a new command, bind it to the key you want, and use this script:

#!/bin/sh
FILE_NAME=$GEDIT_CURRENT_DOCUMENT_PATH 
emacs $FILE_NAME


If you want it to open in the currently-running Emacs, replace emacs with emacsclient, and add the following to your .emacs:

(server-start)

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
This is kind of backward. Why don't you just use Emacs and stay away from all the extra bells and whistles? It'd probably be easier to coax emacs to emulate gedit than the other way around.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If gedit (a) can be scripted to launch another application with the current file as an argument, and (b) will notice if the file is modified on disk and offer to reload it, then you would have a workaround.

I just started to use Wolfram Workbench 2.0 (WB) for Mathematica (MMA) package development.

A friend sent me a whole project that he developed in in WB.

I put this project folder into the workspace/base area where I have other projects.
I started WB , but this friend's project is not found by WB (that is I do not see it in the Package Explorer).

Title: Need IDE suggestions for Chrome Extension project
Description: 
    
    
                    
I currently use Programmer's Notepad for my Chrome Extension project. I like Programmer's Notepad, as it is simple to use and I don't need debugging features (Chrome has all that for me). However, I check the project into Subversion and it stores absolute paths, which will not allow other people to use it unless they use the same exact path.

I have Visual Studio 2010 at my disposal, but I haven't seen a useful way to use it. I have also heard of Aptana Studio, but I was discouraged from trying it out fully because it seemed too bloated for my needs.

What is a good IDE I can use for chrome extension development? The most important factor is good project support. Relative paths need to be stored in the project and it should keep files grouped together so I can work out of the IDE and not have to continuously open files in Windows Explorer.

Secondly good syntax highlighting and intellisense are ideal but I can live without it. Intellisense with jQuery and the built in Chrome Extension API are pluses.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Geany is a good very lightweight with project management and everything. Latest version also includes local intellisense for opened files and has very nice syntax highlighting and some other nice plugins.

Visual Studio 2010 with Resharper (to allow for the JS intellisense) works nice as well but it slightly bloated when it comes to just javascript extension development.

I would actually just recommend a lightweight editor such as Notepad++ or Vim/Emacs but it seems that your project may have grown too big for this so Geany would be my choice.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm starting Java development at a place that uses Weblogic on their production and test servers.   I'd like to use Weblogic on my computer to develop my code.   It seems that Weblogic has a development environment where a personal web server/servlet container is tightly integrated with an Eclipse based IDE of theirs.

I think I might like to go that way eventually, but for right now I would like to keep using the IDE that I am used to.

Can someone point me to a tutorial or a book that would explain how to set up and use Weblogic that way on my computer?

For instance,  I would produce a WAR file with my own tools,  then stick it in a directory in Weblogic on my computer to run it and see how well it works.

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you have not already downloaded WebLogic I would suggest getting started with the Zip Distribution.  It is a smaller distribution than the full installer and you can get it up and running quickly.  Here's a YouTube demo of the Zip Distribution: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHX_ej3ajcI

WebLogic also has support for ANT and Maven, so if you are using those to build and package your applications then you can automate deployment with them as well.  Here's a demo and info on the WebLogic Maven Plugin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcwcGtz0dyc

I use IntelliJ to do development and use the Maven Plugin to deploy directly to WebLogic.

One option may be to use Cargo to help manage the deployment from a Maven build via the Cargo Maven plugin.  Combine that with JRebel and you'll have a nice, state-of-the-art development solution.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a custom JavaScript file and it's getting large. The problem is, though the whole JavaScript is well-written and there is no syntactical error (even colons are there), Visual Studio 2010 can't format the document. I extracted each part separately to a separate file, and there, formatting Ctrl + K + D or Ctrl + E, D works just fine. But when they come together formatting stops working. I saw other posts, and they had no such problem. So I posted my question here.I know that Visual Studio is still at it's infancy for JavaScript support. But do you have the same problem? Is there a way to make JavaScript experience better in VS2010?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There are quite a few things you can do to improve your javascript experience:

1 - Install the WebStandards update:  http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AnnouncingTheWebStandardsUpdateHTML5SupportForTheVisualStudio2010Editor.aspx

2 - Perhaps one or more of the Javascripts extensions will help you.  Go to the Tools Menu, select Extensions, and then search for Javascript.  (#1 is actually the first install that comes up).

But there are a number of other extensions that claim to improve javascript parsing.   There's also a JSLint as well.

I hope these help!

I did some reading on IDE`s (I am currently using Code::Blocks) and everyone appears to think that VS is the best IDE but I am wondering if I can make it portable. For example installing it on a USB and have it work on a computer that has never had it installed before.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Quick version: No.

VS is a huge application, it integrates with Windows at a low level in places: it is a native debugger. Additionally much of VS is built on COM, which requires registration.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you have a specific set of computers that you are going to work on, you can install virtualization software in all of them once, and run VS inside a Virtual Machine. The virtual machine can be created and run directly from an external USB Hard Drive. 

I have done this with both VMWare Workstation and the free VMware Player. The performance penalty of running the VM from an USB is not much and the portability of your environment is great.

I solved this exact problem a bit more easily by just deleting the .svn folders in the bugged folders, then refreshing the workspace view in Eclipse (at which point the "!" changes to a "?"), updating via the Team context menu, then committing via the Team context menu.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I had encountered a similar problem – One day some of my source code files were marked with red exclamation points and the SVN status became OBSTRUCTED.  I look up this condition and found some suggestions that the .svn folder may be corrupted.  After checking that folder and found it to be fine, I finally spotted a difference of version number at the project level.  Someone had committed to the project and now the repository has a newer version number, although the files that I was working with remained unchanged.

So I did Team|Update and brought the project version in sync with the repository and the red exclamation points disappeared.

Hope this helps.

I don't think you can'tcan by default. I'm assuming you are opening downloaded files or such. What I would is create a project (Scrapbook for example is a good name) on desktop and I would put/download the file I want to see in the corresponding src folder. That way when I'm clicking it would open properly. 

Most of the syntax highlight and such goodness of idea comes from a proper project setup (proper JDK paths, libraries, etc).

I've downloaded a few of the "real" IDEs, but I feel like they are overkill and I can't find any way to ease myself into it and/or they are way too busy.

I'm looking for something that does code folding, validation, can colorize PHP/PDO/HTML in the same document, and hopefully do completion of my classes and methods that doesn't require 6 months to be productive again.

Can anyone throw me a bone?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I personally use netbeans 6.9.1 and have been very happy with it.  Here are my favorite features:

-- functions, classes, comment blocks and other structures are automatically set up for code folding, but you can also highlight any block and make an arbitrary code fold.

-- syntax highlighting is good

-- full support for new php 5.3 features (namespaces etc.)

-- the autocomplete works, but also stays out of the way when I don't need it.

-- refactoring works really well

-- it has a lot of built in macros, plus you can create your own

-- it does nice, fast code validation.

-- completely supports xdebug through a local/remote web server.

-- has built in symfony support

-- tracks polymorphism well

-- I program a lot of c/c++ and java as well, so its really nice to get familiar with just one IDE.

-- it has seamless built in supprt for SVN/CVS and other SCMs.  Things like renaming/deleting a file in the IDE play nice with your SCM.  You can also commit, update, diff etc. in the ide.  It also does live diff via colors on the left hand side.

-- I really like the scm diff features.

-- the learning curve isn't too steep, I feel the IDE's features/commands are pretty intuitive.

Overall I have been really happy with netbeans.  I have used a lot of other IDE's and none of them are bad, but they just lack certain features that I need.  netbeans is not perfect either, but for me its the best IDE I have been able to find.  The things I don't really like about netbeans are:

-- everything has to be a project, you can't just work on some code without netbeans creating metadata.  However, the location of the metadata storage is customizable, so it doesn't interfere with your source file directory structure.

-- profiling doesn't really work unless you install some weird solaris stuff.

-- it can't mount an svn+ssh working copy, you have to pull it down locally. if you want to use the SCM features.

-- it can be a little slow if you have a lot of large projects open at a time.  You can close the projects so netbeans doesn't scan the source code continuously, and that helps.  Re-opening a project isn't too slow or difficult either.

All in all, netbeans isn't really breaking any new ground, vim, eclise, phpide and others all do similar things.  I just feel like those things work better in netbeans and are easier to access.

Title: Can Visual Studio tell me how many files I have open?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Assume I have more than 30 or so open within the Visual Studio IDE. Too many to show without scrolling, which makes a manual count laborious.

I can do Window -/strong/pp/ppstrong/strong/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
Paste this sub into a new Macro, it should give you what you want.

Public Sub GetFileCount()

    Dim count = 0
    Dim i As Integer

    For i = 1 To DTE.Windows.Count
        If DTE.Windows().Item(i).Kind = "Document" Then
            count = count + 1
        End If

    Next

    MsgBox("File Count = " &amp; count)

End Sub


Edit:

Based on comments I ran the Macro in VS2010 and did not get the incorrect count mentioned. Try the following changes to see what's actually being counted as a "Document" in the DTE.Windows collection:

Public Sub GetFileCount()

        Dim count = 0
        Dim i As Integer
        Dim msg = ""
        For i = 1 To DTE.Windows.Count
            If DTE.Windows().Item(i).Kind = "Document" Then
                count = count + 1
                msg = msg &amp; DTE.Windows().Item(i).Document.Name &amp; vbCrLf
            End If

        Next

        MsgBox("File Count = " &amp; count &amp; vbCrLf &amp; msg)

    End Sub

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Not a count, but in the document tab row, off to the right, is an upside-down "Eject" symbol that is a shortcut for the document list region of the Windows tab. You can get an approximate count just by eyeballing that. Seriously, if you can't count them all, you probably have too many open at once.
    
    
Title: Delphi 2007 IDE crashes when I try to use &ldquo;Find References&rdquo; under Search menu
Description: 
    
    
                    
After upgrading to Windows 7 all seems to work in my Delphi 2007 version except this one.
I know that 2007 is not build for win 7 but I'm not sure that the OS is the reason. My friend is using it without a problem.
When I use "Find Local References" all is fine.

Do you know a fix for this? Some dll registration may be?

Title: Difference between Project Location and Project Folder in Netbeans?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm creating a new project in Netbeans 6.9, and it's asking me for a Project Location and a Project Folder. What is the difference between these?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The project location path specifies the directory where your project folder will be located.

For example, assume you have some directory d. You want to build a new project and you want to store the project in a folder named x. You decide that x should be located in directory d. Then your project location will be d and your project folder will be x. The paths that would be supplied to Netbeans for project location and project folder are the paths of d and x, respectively.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I think the Netbeans help page does a good job explaining it.


Project Name. Specifies the display name of the project. This name is also used to create the project folder and the context path.
Project Location. Specifies the location where you want to store the project metadata and source code.
Project Folder. Specifies the folder where you want to store the project metadata and source code. The folder is a concatenation of the project location and the project name.

    
    
Title: Is IDE integration *really* useful for a DVCS?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Specifically, for Visual Studio 2008 (or 2010) and Mercurial, but generalize if desired.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
While I don't use Visual Studio, I have used many IDEs over the years and never felt that any version control integration was truly worth the time and effort.  I have always felt more comfortable managing my version control from the command line as opposed to any GUI, integrated or otherwise.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
IDE integration is always nice; that way you can conveniently check in changes as you make (and test) them, which encourages you to check in early and often.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
For a start it is undoubtly useful for people who are commandline-phobic.

Then it depends how confident you are at the command line and how powerful your command line "shell" is. I'm working on a 200KLOC project that was switched quite some time ago from SVN to Mercurial.

I'm doing everything from the command line: I've got shells one shortcut away from my IDE and when I'm in a directory with a Mercurial repository I get a nice custom command prompt showing me the number of heads, the status of the repo, etc. For a great many things a command line and the way all the (text) utilities can be combined is much more powerful and versatile than what any GUI developer can come up with and it's exactly the same when working with (d)VCSes. 

Then other developers on the same project prefer to use a Mercurial plugin for their IDE.

And then some other developers use both: GUI for some Mercurial things and command line for others.

I think that the really useful thing is to have the choice between both options, so that every developer can use what he's more familiar with and even both if he wishes to do so.
    
    
Title: Rational Application Developer (RAD) 7.5+ and websphere runtime will not pick up jars from projects
Description: 
    
    
                    
With RAD Version: 7.5.3, Java 1.5.

I have a couple of different projects.  I needed to break out the java code and turn the *.class files into a jar.  So basically, same *.class files I just removed the code and then jarred the class files into a jar.  

I broke the classes into a jar and then included the jar in the project.  And I also did an order/export on the jar so that other projects can see the jar.

At this point, ideally my project should not have changed because I am using class files in a jar instead of the java code.

When I visit my web application in websphere, I get class not found errors on the classes that are now in the jar.

Project Structure:

A. Project earApp  -- will need the webapp
B. Project webapp  -- will need the project (no jar files or *.java files are found in this project)
C. Project javasrc -- the java source and the NEW JAR file are found here.


I don't think websphere is acknowledging the jar.

Here is the error:

What do you think I need to do?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
We have had the same problem when we upgraded to WAS 7.0

Apparently WAS 7.0 changed how it looks up its dependencies, and you need to make sure the JAR files you are creating are also mentioned in the manifest file where they are used.

So if you're using it in both the EJB and Web project, you will need to update both of the manifest files to reference the JAR.

did you add the jar to the Java EE module dependencies in the project properties dialog? is the jar listed under EAR or Web Libraries node in the package explorer?

I had the same problem until I copied the jar to WebContent/WEB-INF/lib. You could try this.
    
    
Title: How to Specify Project-Specific Package Settings?
Description: 
    
    
                    
How can I specify project-specific package settings in the Delphi 2010 IDE? Changing the packages in the project options does change the packages for all projects in the project group.

This is annoying because I build my application with a package that needs to be disabled in order to compile the BPLs in the project group.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As said in my comment to vcldeveloper's answer (which has somehow vanished now) I can confirm that behaviour. Although I don't know about the intrinsics, I can try to give some hints for an explanation.

When you disable a package in the project options, this will unload this package (and perhaps some more) from the IDE. If it were the case that these settings are unique to each project in the same projectgroup, a simple switching of the project would have to load/unload designtime packages in the IDE. Besides the performance drop, this might be possible to implement.

Let's assume we have two projects in a projectgroup each containing a form with some components. Form1 in Project1 uses a component from Package1 and Form2 in Project2 a component from Package2. For some reason both packages are mutually exclusive. Given the (non-existent) behaviour as explained before, switching between both projects will load/unload the corresponding packages.

But nobody hinders you to open Form2 from Project2 requiring Package2 while still Project1 is selected (which means Package2 is unloaded). Thus the component used on Form2 is unkown and the form cannot be loaded.

Moreover, assume Project1 is selected and Form1 from Project1 is open while you switch to Project2. This would unload Package1 - making the component on Form1 vanish?

There is a reason to keep the packages needed or excluded by all projects in a projectgroup in synch.

A solution to your problem might be to use separate projectgroups.
