Title: In PyCharm IDE, what is the difference between Reformat Code and Auto-Indent Lines?
Description: 
    
    
                    
There are two options in the Code menu of PyCharm: Reformat Code and Auto-Indent Lines. They seem to be doing the same thing: reformatting the code. Is there any difference? 

Reformat Code can process multiple files in the same directory. Is this the difference? One file vs. batch processing? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Auto-Indent Lines does just that and nothing more.

Reformat Code does much more -- it can add missing/remove unnecessary spaces/braces, split statement into multiple lines etc -- all accordingly to your Code Style.
    
    
Title: How to clean the list of previous &ldquo;command line&rdquo; in execute maven goal window of intellij ce
Description: 
    
    
                    
IntelliJ CE is great integrating maven execution for modules.

Im using IntelliJ CE 13, and for custom maven executions i'm using the "Execute maven goal" window.


A great feature it has is it remembers all (and i mean all) of the previous executions, which is a great thing to avoid typing over and over the same command.

BUT, if anytime you type a really long command, the window gets resized to fit in the command, so it's a little bit annoying to scroll in order to view the "choose module" button.

Is there any way of "cleaning" that list of previous executions???
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
To the best of my knowledge, there is not a way via the UI to clear that list. You may want to open a feature request to do such: http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/

That said, there is a hack you can do to clear it (or selective items).


Close your project
Go to the .idea directory within your project

if you are using file based project and not directory based project settings, you can search the .iws file for the following

Backup the workspace.xml file
Open the workspace.xml file
Do a search for &lt;component name="mavenExecuteGoalHistory"&gt;

It's path is: /project/component[@name='mavenExecuteGoalHistory']

Delete any or all of the &lt;option&gt; elements within that &lt;component&gt; element
Save the file and reopen your project.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I want to edit the minecraft server code and add/remove things, I need or not. 


First, am I allowed to edit the minecraft server code? 
And I get the
source of the minecraft_server.jar in IntelliJ, but if I want to
compile, I get 100 errors because in the code there are things like: 
switch(1.$SwitchMap$io$netty$handler$codec$http$websocketx$WebSocket08FrameDecoder$State[((State)state()).ordinal()]) {


I really don't know what to do with these errors, because in the finshed jar, it's in there like my example.

Minecraft Server: https://minecraft.net/download
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I think the source for minecraft servers is intended to be closed (You should not be able to even obtain it).

However, source for modded servers might be open, check Bukkit and similar projects.

Keep in mind that if you were able to find an open project, and you decided to add or delete various things, you are SOLELY responsible for ensuring that clients can still connect and operate properly.

Projects like Bukkit can be modified by writing your own plugins, so unless you want to REALLY change how minecraft operates (by adding new blocks or something!), you should be able to just write your own plugin without laying a hand on the server source code.

I admire your enthusiasm, but make sure you know what you're getting yourself into! :)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The Minecraft server is not open source. So you won't legaly get the source files.


  i want to edit the minecraft server code and add/remove things, i need or not.


I doubt there are things you don't need and if so... don't use them.

But there are OpenSource minecraft servers (like bukkit), that can easily be customized with plugins.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
use BuildTools as explained in spigot, after you got all the folders
go inside the folder Spigot and go inside the folder Spigot-Server 
then inisde src then main then java then net then minecraft then server and there
is the source code, modify the stuff you want in those .java files and when you are ready go back to the folder Spigot/Spigot-Server and put this command
mvn clean package
and thats it... you may need to install some dependencies like maven ... but that will make the spigot.jar inside the folder target with the minecraft modifications...
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I would suggest using Minecraft Forge (Google it) for server and client modding, if Bukkit isn't what you want.

Title: Sublime Text 3 its not using default python
Description: 
    
    
                    
I recently installed sublime text 3 in my pc (Ubuntu 13.10). And i also installed Canopy Enthought and set canopy as default python. But Sublime text instead of using the new default python and ipython, its using the "old" version. In windows i used to run ipython console with SublimeREPL and i have no problems with Canopy. I verified in Terminal the following with this results:

    ~$ which python
    /home/ccp/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/bin/python
    ~$ which ipython
    /home/ccp/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/bin/ipython


So there's no problem with Canopy as default, in Terminal i can access to Canopy python 2.7.3 and also ipython with python 2.7.3 but in sublimeREPL opens python2.7.5+(Ubuntu "old" default).
There's some place where i can changed this? i tried reinstalling Sublime Text 3 but it didnt solve the problem.

ReSharper's cleanup code for C# puts fields at the top, and methods after them, which I find great.

However it's being too technical for me with putting automatic properties in the method sections (so they get mingled with other stuff). As far as I care if they're automatic properties (and not ones with body) -- they're fields to me.

Have you try to install SublimeLinter for Sublime Text 3?

(I don't think this package is directly available in the Package control plugin, so you have to dowload the .zip and extract it in your Sublime Text 3/Packages folder)

[Edit:]Check: "If you plan to edit files that use a JavaScript-based linter (JavaScript, CSS), your system must have a JavaScript engine installed. Mac OS X comes with a preinstalled JavaScript engine called JavaScriptCore, which is used if Node.js is not installed. On Windows, you must install the JavaScript engine Node.js, which can be downloaded from the Node.js site."

Sublime Linter 3 is the way I've found useful so far. 


To use it, first you must install node.js on your system.

Type npm install -g jshint onto your terminal, open Sublime Text.

I have started a new job from a couple months, I work as front developer in a company where up until now everyone was using classic development patterns, but the goal is to move to a new ajax/rest services approach and that's what I do.

In our local development environment our apps run on Resin which runs inside Eclipse and get deployed as war files to C:\Resin\resin-pro-4.0.27\webapps

My problem is that I work mostly on css html and js files, static resources so I shouldn't need to restart Resin and wait 15 seconds (when it doesn't crash) to see the effect of every little piece of code I change.

Other problem is that I need to edit some files in external editors (sublime text for js, Crunch for LESS); I managed to make Eclipse open the external editor but even with the "Refresh using native hooks or polling" build option it takes a while to realize files have changed and restart Resin.

I also tried just working on the unpacked war in C:\Resin\resin-pro-4.0.27\webapps\appname but even there it takes like one minute before you can see the changes on the browser (is there some caching going on the server? can I disable it?)

 - like 600s, so it only checks for updates every 10 minutes.

&lt;dependency-check-interval&gt;2s&lt;/dependency-check-interval&gt;


Also check resin.properties for a variable definition in newer versions.
However I'm currently having problems picking up changes without a full redeploy.

Time is gone a whlie.
But now it's possible, to run Python 2.7 on Surface RT.
All what you have to do is to set you Surface rt in developermode, as followed:

https://github.com/VNNGYN/Windows-RT-8.1-Development-Tool

you than get Surface rt run in test mode.
In testmode you can sign all the already ported application, there are avaible on net.
To sign the appclication with a cert, you can use:

https://github.com/VNNGYN/Windows-RT-8.1-Development-Tool/wiki/How-do-I-sign-an-application%3F

than all the application, like python 2.7 can run under Standard mode.

https://github.com/VNNGYN/Windows-RT-8.1-Development-Tool/wiki/How-do-I-sign-an-application%3F

and there you will find Notepad++, which is the best to generate python scripts

Is there a way to document variables that are accessed via the __get magic method in a way that IDEs can recognize their existence and return type?

For instance I want to expose done and helper via __get but also want an IDE like PHPStorm to be able to know that they exist:

class Thing
{
    /** @var bool */
    private $done;

    /** @var HelperThing */
    private $helper;

    __get( $name )
    {
        if ( $name === "done" )
            return $done;

        if ( $name === "helper" )
            return $helper;
    }

I was trying to avoid using the psudeo-getter approach like $thing-&gt;getHelper() as I prefer the style of $thing-&gt;helper-&gt;someOtherMethod().

You can use the @property tag for magic properties, and @method for magic method documentation. These are supported by PHPStorm. See the documentation for @property and @method for more information.
    
    
Title: Adjusting directory structure in Visual Studio messing up #includes?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm sure there is a simple way to fix this somewhere in Visual Studio's settings, but I can't figure it out at all. Here's my issue: I'm a novice programmer who's trying to work on my first large multimedia project, and I've realized that it would be in my best interest to set up a project file directory structure that is more organized to suit my needs. Up until today I've been just using Visual Studio's default directory and build options. As of now, my project is only about 10 headers and 10 source files, so I thought it would be a good choice to re-arrange everything sooner rather than later. I thought that the easiest way to do this would be to start a clean 'solution' and just import my old files.

Here's my planned folder structure:

-Solution
    -Project
        -Source Files
        -Header Files
        -Multimedia Assets
        -Release Builds
        -Documentation


Now, as I'm new to Visual C++, I didn't realize that creating all these folders inside the 'solution explorer' does not create actual folders inside windows. (So it seems to me at least..)

So, I went ahead and created a mirrored set of REAL folders inside my Solution\Project\ directory. I placed all my headers within my Header Files folder, all my source code inside my Source Files folder, etc.

The problem I have now, is that Visual C++ is clearly expecting all my files to be within the same directory. And my existing #includes no longer work. I've tried changing them to be -

#include "Headers\xxxxx.h"



But, that doesn't seem to work either. I'm not sure where I have to go to inform Visual Studio C++ Express where the root directory is. Once I figure that out, I would guess that it would be as simple as including the file path from that root directory. 


Is there a way to set the 'root directory' for my project to be my 'Project' folder? Or is there a better way to manage my file directory when using Visual Studio C++ Express?

Description: 
    
    
                    
Please, suggest adequately simple UML diagramming tool.

I don't want to be obliged to rightclick at the page, then select "Create Class/Entity", then work with class dialog, then right-click to add each attribute and to set it up with GUI...

The class symbol is just a rectangle and it's contents is just a text. So I would like to edit it so simple as text editing.

So, for example, I want to enter something like

BankAccount&lt;ENTER&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;
owner : String&lt;ENTER&gt;
balance : Dollars=0&lt;ENTER&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt;
deposit(amount : Dollars)&lt;ENTER&gt;
withdrawl( amount : Dollars )&lt;ENTER&gt;


to get the following picture



So no excess clicks and keystokes, only what is absolutely necessary. No obliged dialogs and context menus.

This ability should not be just initial, i.e. once created class should remain editable. For example, to add attribute one should required to place cursor and previous attribute and press ENTER or some simple insert command.

Of course IF I WANT I should be able to call dialogs and property lists to fine tune my data.

The Visual Studio's Database editor can be regarded as good prototype.

I am not a Flash/ActionScript developer but I need to achieve a very small task in Flash. I need to display user audio input level in Flash. I found that I can do that using ActionScript (according to this).

Any help highly appreciated.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use the Flash Pro IDE  (eg Flash CS6),  Flash Builder (Adobe),  or FlashDevelop.  There are also a few more like FDT and IntelliJ.

If this is a quick and dirty no/low budget scenario for you, I would recommend FlashDevelop.

If speed is of the utmost importance and you don't have time to learn, then Flash Pro CS~ would be a good bet.

If you're an experienced coder and will be using the tool a fair bit, Flash Builder (as a commercial product) is a good bet. Though FlashDevelop is also a good open source alternative to Flash Builder.

They all have tutorials on their websites on how to get your environment setup and start creating swfs.

Not aware of any plugins that do this automatically, but you could write a script using command-line svn tools (svn utilities are installed by default on Linux; on Windows you can use CollabNet SVN or similar). You can pull the svn logs and redirect to changelog.txt in a format you desire.

You can also do this in python using pysvn module.

Answer 1: 

    
    
First question, according to the Eclipse Documentation 'Ctrl + /' maps to the source action Comment. 

That doesn't look like auto suggest to me ?

That said, the GtkSourceView version of Anjuta appears to not support Comment / Uncomment for some unspecified reason according to a Mailing List post, apparently the Scintilla version does however. There was talk of working around this using a Python plugin but I don't think anything eventuated from that discussion.

Regarding code completion in Anjuta , it should automatically provide symbol completion , and call tips along with class members if it has indexed your symbols properly, this should be done as you are typing (code-ahead).

Regarding your If not clause, see the following relevant StackOverflow Posts

Syntax highlighting.  From Wikipedia:


  Syntax highlighting is a feature of some text editors that display

  the category of terms. This feature eases writing in a structured
  language such as a programming language or a markup language as both

Description: 
    
    
                    
When I'm working on large projects, I always tend to end up with about 7 or more different tabs open in eclipse.

I'm wondering if there is a plugin available for eclipse that works like Firefoxes tab groups, in that you can group different tabs together and switch between them.  This would make it easier for me to concentrate on my different projects so when i'm working on the "c heeseburger factory" project and something goes wrong on the "hotdog factory" project, I don't have to add a further 8 tabs to what I have open, I can just minimise the current tab group and open a new lot safe in the knowledge once i'm finished with the "hotdog factory" i can have all my "cheeseburger factory" files open in one click.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There are no universally working tab group plug-in, as far as I know.

However, it is possible to use Mylyn for this reason: when you are working on the "cheeseburger factory" project, you activate a corresponding task, and Mylyn will record a context. When you switch to the "hotdog factory" project, you terminate the currently executed task (the context is saved, but the editors are closed), then open the other task. When you are finished, you simply activate your original task again, and you get back your previous context.

I'm not sure if I'm missing something as I'm new to Aptana but. I'm having trouble collapsing my class methods. I like to collapse everything except the function I'm currently working in within my class but everytime collapse and then go to edit, everything expands again. 

I'm guessing it's therefore some sort of feature that everything within a class is expanded when editing any method within the class. Is there any way around this at all. I'm loving Aptana so far, but this is extremely annoying.

Like you this one has bugged me on and off for quite a while and it's even more annoying when I found out how stupidly simple the answer is. It's not written in any of the documentation that I can find.

But all you have to do is fold up all the methods, functions, classes etc that you want folded, then hit "ctrl s" to save. That's it. This step is not required in some other editors so it didn't occur to me immediately.

Thereafter if you hover over the + icon you get a preview of the folded up code.
Obviously if you click on + the code expands.
By the way: if you want to add to the items that can be folded:

I just upgraded my Xcode, and created a blank new project, and discovered that there's many new settings that don't exist in my old Xcode projects. As a result, when I build and run my old projects, I get weird warnings that I didn't before.

I think it's just a matter of having the good factory defaults that come with new projects. Is there an easy way for me to migrate to the new project settings.

Right now, I'm having to create a new empty project, and move (almost one-by-one), all my files and groups over to the new one, and re-stitching everything together.

Use xcconfig files rather than the build pane. You can also build your own templates. Some of this has changed in Xcode 4, but most still applies.
    
    
Title: php compiler or syntax checker
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm looking for a php syntax checker, preferably as an eclipse plugin, preferably be able to sort of compile it(at least find undefined variables in addition to syntax checking.  Does such thing exist?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Every better IDE (PhpStorm, Eclipse/PDT, Eclipse/PHPEclipse, Netbeans with PHP-Plugin, and so on) comes with automatic syntax check built-in. At least PhpStorm is able to find undefined variables. The last time I used PDT it didn't support it. PHPEclipse seems to be not maintained anymore, so I assume, that it cannot find undefined variables too, and netbeans ... don't know.

If you just want to check the syntax the quick&amp;dirty way, you can use the php-interpreter itself

php -l filename.php

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Of course, look on this:
http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/

This IDE using php parser engine to syntax, and is for free :-).
But, better do not use the plugin version from update site, but All-In-One Package. At least previous versions from update site did not work too well...

Install phpEclipse for syntax-checking:

In PHP there is no such thing as an undefined variable. Variables are automatically initialized with null.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Zend Studio (custom Eclipse) also has a syntax checker, FWIW.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Our PHP Formatter parses PHP code to an AST, and then prettyprints the results.  This can be used as a command-line script.  If the source file isn't parsable, the tool exits with with an error (and doesn't prettyprint).  So, if you ignore the prettyprint feature, this is precisely a command-line level syntax checker. Easy to launch from Eclipse.

Title: Editing OpenCL in netbeans
Description: 
    
    
                    
I recently read a question on IDE's here on StackOverflow, having always been an emacs user I decided to try out one of these ide's, namely netbeans for editing C++. It was so nice that I got a little carried away and wanted to edit OpenCL files in it to.

And now for my question. I have netbeans set up to process the opencl source files like C files but this causes a problem. The __kernel keyword makes the syntax checker act really strange. 

Does anyone know how to make netbeans ignore a keyword in a specific(*.cl) file?

The following solution looks like its working:

#ifndef tan
#define __kernel
#define __global
#define __local
#define __private
#define get_global_id
#define get_global_size
#define get_local_id
#define get_local_size
#define barrier
#endif 


Since tan is defined without a header, netbeans does not see it, and the keywords are available.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It is not the answer you want, but for temporary editing, just put lines like

#define __kernel
#define __global
#define __local
#define __private


at the beginning of the cl file. This is working in Eclipse. I think it will work in Netbeans, too. 

Drawback: You need pay attention to remove the #define statements, otherwise the code will not work.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
In order to make netbeans ignore a keyword, you could define ONLY_DEFINED_IN_NETBEANS in the preprocessor definitions entry in the code assistence options of the project, while not defining it elsewhere. Your code can then be modified as

#ifdef ONLY_DEFINED_IN_NETBEANS
#define __kernel
#define __global
#define __local
#define __private
#define get_global_id
#define get_global_size
#define get_local_id
#define get_local_size
#define barrier
#endif


The netbeans parser will ignore these keywords.

The same trick can be applied as a patch to the bug reported in netbeans on the __restrict__ keyword:

#ifdef ONLY_DEFINED_IN_NETBEANS
#define __restrict__
#define restrict
#endif

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
you can tell the C editor of netbeans to entirely ignore syntax errors but i don't think that you will have luck to teach netbeans the CL specific keywords.

How do you include source directory to Padre IDE for autocomplete and for running the script.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
a) there is a configuration option for setting the Perl interpreter arguments.

b) Set the PERL5LIB environment variable to your include paths

c) Create an empty padre.yml file in your project home dir, Padre will use this as the working dir, otherwise it's the file's dir.

The autocomplete function is using the current file and a perltags file (if one exists).

Description: 
    
    
                    
I rarely use complex IDEs (I favor simple editors and command-line tools) and my struggles with Eclipse have finally driven me into a corner I can't get out of. I don't even understand what happened, so I'll provide what details I feel are relevant -- feel free to ignore, or ask for more.

I installed Maven management for a Java project through m2eclipse, downloaded the indexes, installed some dependencies manually editing the pom, and...

... the package tree dissappeard from the left pane. The folders are still there, I can open all the files and edit them; the JRE library node is there, the Maven node is there, everything but the classical package/class tree.

I can still work by going through the folders, I guess, but many of the tools Eclipse provides (e.g. refactoring) are not available.

Help would be most appreciated!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It seems, that the folders are not configured as source folders. Do you have the appropriate Maven folder structure, e.g. src/main/java, src/main/resources etc.? If so, then right click on the project and select "Update Project configuration" in the "Maven" sub menu. Then the project structure should be correct.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Make sure that all the source folders in under /src.
The main doubt I have is you have probably messed up or worst, deleted some config file, either Maven specific (which I don't know) or eclipse specific. Note that there are many hidden/non-hidden files which are created by eclipse.

Also, try refreshing project and restarting the IDE. Seems trivial but sometimes works.

Title: NetBeans remote editing for Java projects?
Description: 
    
    
                    
My project makes use of the Play! framework, so I don't need an editor that can compile. I generally like NetBeans, but would like to remote edit source files on the server to save time. I also often switch between my desktop/netbook for development, so remote editing would save me from syncing a dev environment.

All my searches for remote editing for Netbeans suggest that it's available for PHP projects, but I don't see anything for Java projects. If Netbeans doesn't support remote editing for Java projects, is there an IDE that does?

Edit: I develop on Windows but the server runs Linux.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You don't mention your operating system, but there are solutions for Windows where you can make a FTP server appear as a regular drive in Windows. That way you can use any editor/IDE you like regardless whether that supports FTP access or not.

So you want something that (a) runs in the browser, something like the built-in textarea, and in particular does not require your user to download and install any software, and (b) does automatic syntax highlighting and line numbering of the HTML/CSS code they edit?

Will any of the following work for you?
(Some of them might require you to set up a textarea where the user types and a separate div tag where the formatted text shows up, something like the Stack Overflow system; others let the user type directly into the formatted text).

Sorry if this has been asked before, I searched but couldn't find anything.

I'm a novice (like, just now moving on to true object-oriented programming) Java programmer taking AP Computer Science online. Outside of class, I've been working on some programs for personal use. One program that I'd like to write needs some third-party APIs, notably Apache Commons. I'd also like to have Google's Guava API available, among others. The only problem is, I have no idea how to make the APIs available to my IDE. I'm still trying to decide on an IDE, so I'd like to make the APIs available system-wide if possible, but at minimum I need compatibility with IntelliJ IDEA 9 CE. I'm on Mac OSX, but I sometimes have to work on a Windows PC.

You need to download the necessary JARs and then in NetBeans, I believe there is a "Libraries" or "Classpath" menu option somewhere toward the end. Thats where you'll need to add the libraries you plan on using by referencing any JARs you've downloaded.

You can see it here from their website

Title: C++ IDE feature: Synchronized viewing columns for headers and implementation files?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Modern screens have large resolutions, fitting two or three columns of 80-column code easily. C++ basically requires that you separate your code into .hpp and .cpp files.

So, to utilize this space, why not automatically open the .cpp file in a second column when you open a .hpp file (and vice versa)? This obviously wouldn't work for extreme cases, although for a lot of projects there is a direct correspondence between the filenames that would be easy to determine. To me, this seems like a very reasonable use of this space, and it's hard to imagine it hasn't been done.

Is there an IDE that does this? A plugin? Or, why do you think it can't be done?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you're in Visual Studio, a plugin (Visual Assist X), which is already very nice to have for C++ projects has a similar feature. It's not completely automatic, but all you have to do is press Alt+o and it will open the other file in the set. That is, if you're .hpp pressing the key will open the .cpp, and vice versa.

Their website demonstrates how this works in a video. It also works for things like XAML/Code Behind files, Windows Forms/Code files, etc. (Basically anywhere files operate in pairs, that key combo switches to the other file in the pair)
