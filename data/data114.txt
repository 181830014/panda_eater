Title: PhpStorm: set file type for a single file
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've inherited a project where all Smarty template (should be .tpl) are named .html

Problem is that there are html files also, so I can't globally redefine .html to always be smarty. Also, with 10 years+ of legacy code, I can't just rename the file.

Is there anyway I can get PhpStorm to recognize a single file (or a directory) as another format then the file name?
    

        
Title: Add space between type and diamond bracket, and after comma
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Visual Studio 2013. I've got all my formatting perfect (which is none whatsoever) except for when I do

Dictionary &lt;int, int&gt; dict = new


and I hit enter for the autocomplete it'll end up as

Dictionary &lt;int, int&gt; dict = new Dictionary&lt;int,int&gt; ();


I want it to instead be

Dictionary &lt;int, int&gt; dict = new Dictionary &lt;int, int&gt; ();
                                           ^     ^


Notice the extra space marked by the ^. Going back and adding those 2 extra spaces is really hurting productivity!

The same thing occurs when I use generics with a single type such as List &lt;int&gt;. I looked at every formatting option in the settings and I don't see anything about this one.

Answer 1: 

    
    
I haven't seen it explicitly stated anywhere yet, but I'm 90% sure the editor works with descendants of com.vaadin.ui.CustomComponent. Thus, my suggestion is to create a new CustomComponent/Vaadin Composite as described here, edit it visually and add an instance of it to your UI.

P.S. If you go and do some manual changes and still want to keep it editor-parseable, you should pay attention to at least the following (from what I can recall now):


@Autogenerated fields and methods
alignments it generates as new Alignment(34) instead of Alignment.MIDDLE_RIGHT
labels `ContentMode.HTML (not 100% sure but I remember setting these in the constructors instead of the autogenerated methods)

Is there a trick I can do to Visual Studio 2013 to get the icons to show up crisply?

I'm running my monitor at 1920 x 1080. I'm using the dark theme.

Here's a picture of what the Visual Studio team indicated would be our experience even on a resolution as high as 4k, which mine is not that high. If this was my ux, I would not have posted this question today.



Here's the same area of my screen. Notice the fuzziness around the edges of the icons.



But it's really bad over on the property grid. I mean the ones right above  [+]Font.



An IDE can look OK on my monitor, so I don't think it's my monitor. Here's an equivalent area from Android Studio. The little icons to the right of "Component Tree" are crisp enough for my eyes to not notice any degredation.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Selenium IDE, and I have to use only that tool.
I have this scenario: I've the check if my mailbox it contains message or not. 
The only way is to check if there is a certain string on the page.

I've applied this 

Command: verifyNotText
Target: //form[@id='messages']/table/tbody/tr/td[5]
Value: "on behalf of:.*"


How can I check the result of this command?
I mean: if the result is true the test will proceed with a list of commands,
instead it should execute other commands.

I was thinking to use something like:

Command: gotoif 
Target:  previous command
Value:   goAhead


Have you any suggestion?

Thank you in advance!

Answer 1: 

    
    
Try to use storeTextPresent. If you want to use gotoIf function, you need a variable.

storeTextPresent on behalf of:.* text //text is a variable name
gotoIf ${text}==on behalf of:.* Yes //Yes and No are labels
gotoIf ${text}!=on behalf of:.* No
label Yes 
//instructions if text present equals "on behalf of:.*"
goto End
label No
//instructions if text present not equals "on behalf of:.*"


Another useful thing might be using goto function. You can "drive" your test with this function, if you want to jump to particular step.
Example:

goto End //jump to label End
label End


Hope it helps!

I want to do the same set of operations on different pages that are called by a click on a target "link=1" for page 1, then "link=2" for page 2... Hence, I want to automate the clicking on 1, then 2, etc.

How should I proceed? I was considering using label and goto label (Flow Control plug-in for Firefox) with a variable that would increase each time. However I do not know how to increment a variable in Selenium IDE and above all how to use a variable in the field target for the click (I tried link=${variablename} which does not work).

I'm a beginner with not much programming experience, mainly using the capture/recording tool of Selenium IDE and modifying the obtained results, so a simple solution -even not the optimal one- would be appreciate. Many thanks !

Here's an example to increment:

&lt;td&gt;store&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;counter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;storeEval&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;${counter}+1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;counter&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;echo&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;${counter}&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;


The variable counter should remain in scope through all tests in the suite.

store     | 1            | counter
storeEval | ${counter}+1 | counter
echo      | ${counter}   |

Is anyone aware of any extension where you show the interfaces inside a namespace/folder at the top, ideally with a different icon, followed by the implementation classes below.

It is annoying that whenever you have a bunch of interfaces they all get shown in the middle of their current namespace as I is the 9th letter of the alphabet and they end up being in between of a bunch of other classes. And then if you have an actual class starting with I, it ends up being shoved in between a bunch of interfaces.

Is anyone ware of such an extension?

If not is anyone aware of any extension points which can be used for possibly developing a custom plugin for the built in solution explorer?

I wouldn't want to re-invent the wheel and create a brand new solution explorer :|

I use both VS2013 and VS2010. But any extension for any VS would be helpful!!

EDIT

Just noticed, that this is available in Class View, but than I lose the cascaded namespace folders  functionality :-( In class view you can sort by object type. No such thing in solution explorer?

I use the Zend Studio.  It does all the thing you are looking to do.  I think there is even a free licence - if you are in to licenses.  You can get the same thing (I think) by install eclipse and doing the independant install of different packages.  I tried it one time and was unsuccessful (that was a million years ago).  I tried the visual studio plugg-in  ( I really like visual studio - don't like micro soft).  I dont think I got it to work as promised.  That too was a million years ago.

Answer 2: 

    
    
Old question and I am sure you have already made your decision, but for the benefit of Googlers I too was looking to use Visual Studio with PHP and here is what I concluded. 

First, I spend most of my time developing in c#/.Net, so VS is my IDE of choice and I really like it. I have a few PHP projects that I work on occasionally and do not have a lot of time to dedicate to them. I did try using editors built for PHP such as PHPStorm and I do think they are a better choice for PHP if that is you main thing, but ultimately I felt like too much of my mental effort was spent switching gears and learning a new IDE instead of getting something accomplished. 

So that leaves PHP Tools and VS.PHP. My choice is PHP Tools simply because it appears to have more support and ongoing development. PHP Tools is very active on social media and has developed a VS 2017 version. VS.PHP has not posted any social media since 2015 and as of yet does not have a 2017 version.

For years I have used JCX VS.PHP for Visual Studio but the last update was Dec 2016 and VS.PHP is no longer being sold. The last version of JCX VS.PHP was for VS 2015. There will not be a version for VS 2017. It appears you can still download the last updated version of JCX VS.PHP for VS 2015. But if I was making this decision today I would go with PHP Tools and in fact you will have to go with PHP Tools if you want to use VS 2017 and above. It is really to bad JCX VS.PHP stopped development I really like the product and was very productive with it. By the way if you can in fact download the latest VS.PHP for free and are willing to continue with VS 2015 it still is a great development environment for PHP under Visual Studio. You just won't get support.

Is there an IDE with SystemC out of the box without compiling the lib for windows AND mac?
Looking for a download, but can't find. Why everybody needs to compile it on its own?

Thanks

Any C++ IDE will work once you have the library installed. I recommend Eclipse for C++ that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

EDA tool vendors like Cadence and Synopsys will provide you a pre-compiled library and IDE, but not for free.
