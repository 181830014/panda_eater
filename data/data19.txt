Title: Not select dollar ($) in PhpStorm on double-click?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am coming from Dreamweaver into PhpStorm 8.0.2 (on Windows 8.1).

How do you set it up so that when selecting a variable, you do not select the dollar ($)? This needs to include variables separated by underscores.

I have tried the various settings to do with CamelHumps, and had mixed results, but still not ideal.

For example, double-clicking the variable $foo_bar, I would like it to select foo_bar.


With "Honor CamelHumps", it will select $foo_bar.
Without "Honor CamelHumps", it will select foo or bar depending on which word you double-click on.

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It's now fixed - there is an option to allow selecting of $ in variable names - see https://stackoverflow.com/a/42624161/4879058

you should click exactly underscore sign when double clicking to select foo_bar 
    
    
Title: How to integrate Behat with PHPStorm / other IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
Behat is the leading BDD framework for PHP.  I use PHPStorm and want to integrate Behat into the IDE as an external tool.

Question: How should I set up Behat as an external tool (ie, output filters, macros, etc) in PHPStorm or any other IDE for that matter?

note: PHPUnit has deprecated their BDD support and will remove it in 3.6 (in deference to Behat), so I believe the integrated PHPUnit testing in PHPStorm isn't ideal for Behavior Driven Development.

update Feb 8-2012: PHPStorm's roadmap indicates Behat syntax will be integrated in the 4.0 release which is due Q1 2012! What can I say - PHPStorm rocks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Here's what I came up with, if anybody else out there needs it.

First, create behat-html.bat in the same folder as behat.bat (your PHP folder).  The contents of behat-html.bat should look something like this:

call %PHP_PEAR_BIN_DIR%\behat.bat --out="features\support\behat_test_output.html" --colors --format="html" %*
call features\support\behat_test_output.html


Second, in PHPStorm setup the external tool to run Behat with whatever parameters you like (tags, scenarios, etc).  Here are my settings for a general-purpose command:

Program: C:\Progz\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.5\behat-html.bat
Parameters: $FilePath$
Working Directory: $FileDir$\..


Third, setup a Keymap to run the tool.

Now with your .feature file in focus, press your shortcut key.  The batch file will run the scenarios, generate a pretty HTML output file, and open that file with your default browser.  Not as nice as having it integrated into PHPStorm, but it's a pretty efficient work flow nevertheless.

Tip: You might also want to set up a second external-tool in order to run with --strict

Hope this helps!

Title: Remote coding and execution with python: what IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have been developing a project in python for the last six months, and love the language. But I have yet to find an IDE or text editor that could provide some extra functionality for me. I currently have syntax highlighting which is one of the easiest things to get, but not much more. I am dreaming of having my IDE jump to the line in my code that caused the crash instead of reading the line number from the backtrace and manually locating it in my text editor. I have been looking for something that could do this under my development constraints, but no success. My constraints are the following:


The python code being developed rests on a remote machine, equipped with enough RAM and CPUs to run the code. That machine has no screen or keyboard.
I code from my laptop, a macbook pro running OS X which is not meant to execute the code.
The remote machine is running Fedora 12 and provides SSH connectivity with root access.
My connection isn't good enough at home to run an X11 IDE on the distant machine and have the interface displayed on my machine.


What I have been doing up to now is to log-in to the remote machine via SSH using the excellent CyberDuck client. This enables me to open a text file residing on the remote machine inside any of my local usual text editors like TextMate or TextWrangler and have changes uploaded automatically every time the file is saved. This really gives you the felling you are editing the distant file in your usual cocoa interface.

Then to execute the python code, I open a second SSH connection, this time using a terminal into which I would type:

$ ssh user@dns
$ ipython -pylab
$ execfile("/projectdir/code.py")


Finaly, I read the backtrace and go back to my local text editor to find the correct line number. There must be a better way ! Any ideas ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You may or may not like this suggestion, but I would use vim, setting makeprg and errorformat appropriately.  This way you can ssh in as you normally would, edit files directly on the remote machine, and compile/error fix using quickfix-errorlist.  It will only cost you the time to set makeprg and errorformat correctly.  If you do a little digging the info is out there.

EDIT


ssh user@intoyourbox.com
Put the lines at the bottom of this answer in ~/.vimrc 
vim somemodule.py
Type ":make somemodule.py"
Type ":cw" which may stand for c as in the language, window
vim will popup a window [Quickfix List]
Cursor over an error in the [Quickfix List]
Press enter
vim changes your cursor to the window above and places it on the error
Fix the error using your vim skills, ":h" for help and tutorials
Ctrl+w, j will move the cursor down a window, back to your quickfix list
Ctrl+w, k will move the cursor up a window
Repeat steps 7-12 as necessary
":make somemodule.py" to make sure you fixed everything
Welcome yourself to the darkside, vim rules.


~/.vimrc settings:


"python makeprg settings

setlocal makeprg=python\ %

setlocal errorformat=
        \%A\ \ File\ \"%f\"\\\,\ line\ %l\\\,%m,
        \%C\ \ \ \ %.%#,
        \%+Z%.%#Error\:\ %.%#,
        \%A\ \ File\ \"%f\"\\\,\ line\ %l,
        \%+C\ \ %.%#,
        \%-C%p^,
        \%Z%m,
        \%-G%.%#



Setting makeprg tells vim that your "compiler" is python.  Setting the errorformat tells vim how to parse the output of your "compiler" so you can jump to error lines.  Look around on the internet, there are plenty of vimrc suggestions for programming in python.  There are makeprg/errorformat settings for Xcode/Visual C++/Perl/etc as well which really makes vim a win-win situation if you program in different languages.  There's also other fancy stuff like autoindent, code completion and syntax highlighting.  Enjoy

Note: These settings were taken almost verbatim from here.

here is a good list of Python-Editors.

In my opinion WingIDE (there's a free version) is very feature-rich, good and easy and supports Remote-Debugging (only in the commercial version). Also Eclipse PyDev-Plugin, which is fully free, is worth looking into it and seems to support Remote-Debugging.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You should keep your eye on PyCharm - it isn't production ready yet, but it has some real potential to be a great IDE.  I've been using it for about 7 months now - you can renew the 45 day free trial as long as you keep your build current.  I believe that remote debugging is a feature that the production version will support.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
It's been years since I used it, but the commercial version of Komodo includes a remote debugger, and is generally a very competent package for Python programming.

Alternatively, you might try a standalone remote debugger: WinPdb - which, despite the name, works on Mac and Linux - is very good. 
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
You could try the Professional version of PyCharm. It is by far the best remote debugger I have found till date.. there is full debugging functionality available for remote development. The only catch is that you might have to shell out a few dollars per year. 
    
    
Title: Vim - Show data type
Description: 
    
    
                    
I typically code most of my C projects in Vim. I am comfortable with navigation, search and replace, and indexing via Ctags/Cscope.

One feature I would like to have, if possible, is a keymapping that will show the datatype for a variable under the cursor on screen.

For example, if my cursor is on a variable, "test123" (ie: int test123 = 0) is there a way to have the type (int) and some other details about the variable shown in another tab within Vim? 

Also, is there something similar that would do the same for a struct variable, and show a list of all its members in the descriptive tab as well as the type (ie: struct)?

I've also noticed that sometimes while coding, I have a tab titled "[Scratch][Preview]" at the top of Vim that appears to fulfill this requirement, but I have no idea what triggers it (searches and Ctag searches don't seem to trigger it). It looks like so:

name: myStruct::instanceOfStrct|  2 cmd: /^   int instanceOfStrct;$/
.. (up a dir)                  |  3 kind: m
&lt;/code/test/test.c             |  4 struct:   myStruct
|+config/                      |  5 access:   public
|+lib/                         |  6 filename: /code/test/test.c


I think this is something that already exists in Vim to some extent, but I have not idea how to work with it.

Thank you.

I do not know of any plugin that does what you want, however it should be quite possible using libclang. There is a fork of clang_complete that adds 'go to definition' functionality which is close to what you want. However development on that plugin seems to have stagnated.

Also the scratch buffer appears when doing autocompletion to give more information about a specific completion. It can be enabled and disabled using the completeopt setting.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using DBArtisan 8.5.5 and it has the ability to generate Database Diagrams using Build Query, it has a nice feature that lets it autojoin, detecting potential relationships on newly added tables to the diagram. So the diagram results into a SQL statement since its a Query Builder after all.

Is it possible to provide an SQL statement in DBArtisan and generate the Database Diagram? In other words, the reverse (give it the SQL to generate the diagram, instead of using diagrams to generate SQL)?

If no such feature, is there a product out there for Sybase DB that will provide said feature?

DbVis is an actionable choice, being open source and powerful - it's got a good amount of extra features aside from the one you need.

If you're willing to pay, Aqua Data Studio is a very complete and intuitive database IDE.

As a middle ground solution, disposing of both a - constantly updated - open source edition, the DBeaver Open Source IDE, and an Enterprise Edition. Both of these also offer what you need, the main differences as of now being interface, SSH algorithm support and SQL debugging framework offered in Enterprise. You can take a deeper look yourself, comparing the Open Source features with the Enterprise ones.

I set in geany a key shortcut to Send Selection to Terminal action which send the current line (or selection) to the build-in terminal (according to: shortcut to send selection to terminal in geany). 

Then I change send_selection_unsafe=false to send_selection_unsafe=true in the geany.conf file (according to: Geany: execute line in Terminal)

Everything works well, I can send a line to terminal which is automatically executed. My problem is that at this point the cursor remains on the line after sending it to terminal.

Maybe I miss something, but is it possible to set or configure behaviour that cursor is automatically move to next line after using Send Selection to Terminal so than I can sending lines to terminal one after another (without hitting down arrow) ?

like this:

print("hello world!")
#I want cursor on this line after sending previous line to terminal, so this can be send to terminal immediately

Ctrl + F11 is the "Run" keyboard shortcut in Eclipse.

This makes the Ctrl + F11 shortcut nearly useless. I either have to press Ctrl + Alt + T, name of main class, Ctrl + F11, or use the mouse.

Do I have something misconfigured? What can I do to make Ctrl + F11 really run my program, no matter which file is active in the editor? Or is everybody using the Ctrl + F11 shortcut like that?

I am able to create a scala project and add a package, but i couldn't add scala object, at the time it shows "projectname" is not a Scala project error message in add object dialog. 

I have googled and found it could be related to JDT Weaving not enabled in eclipse. I have verified, its enabled and running in my environment.

The error message means your project is not recognize as a Scala one (as detailed in the scala.tools.eclipse.wizards.AbstractNewElementWizardPage.scala class.
But adding "Scala nature" to your project, as suggested by Alexey Romanov in the comments, might not be enough in this case.

The requirements mentioned in scala-ide.org clearly include:


Java Developer Toolkit 1.6
Eclipse Classic 3.5.2

This seems simple enough, but I can't seem to find the setting in Eclipse to change this setting.

I prefer my consoles to have dark colors with white text.  I leave the print to stderr as the red default.

My problem lies in when I receive an Exception, it's set to a very dark blue, so I can't see the text of it easily without highlighting the link.

If you want to create a project that you can deploy with Tomcat, you need to change the value of the 'Java EE Version' field from 'Java EE 6' to 'Java EE 5', before you hit the Finish button.

I asked the same thing and got this quite good answer: How to track execution time of each line / block of lines / methods in PHP?.

Some additional notes on that (stuff i've collected in other SO posts in my own research with this problem):


The port might be also 9001 (seems to work for some people while 9000 don't).
Switching to PHPStorm IDE is a real alternative that solves this problem (as PHPStorm has included perfectly running xdebug already).
Download a new version of xdebug via the wizard (https://xdebug.org/wizard.php) and if you follow the instructions maybe you will be lucky.
Switching off the firewall might help.
Add to php.ini xdebug.idekey=netbeans-xdebug.
Find out if you have a xdebug.ini file and add the xdebug related php.ini lines to that file.
you have to un-comment the zend_extension line (i.e. remove the ';' at its begninning), so Xdebug is actually loaded.
make sure Xdebug is loaded, calling phpinfo() from a PHP file (just to be sure).

I had a similar issue and came across a post to fix the problem.  My html form (testform.html) was calling a php script (runQuery.php) and Netbeans could not break at the set break points in my runQuery.php

After checking all the configuration settings in php.ini and Netbeans by searching on forums like this one, I discovered that netbeans will only break on the break points if the Index file for the project is a PHP file.  This is very important otherwise you will spend hours trying to figure out why break points are not working. 

In Netbeans go into the File/Project Properties/Run Configuration and check that the Index file is a PHP file.  In my case I changed my index file from testform.html to testform.php and it worked, I was able to break on break points.

Is port 9000 available for usage, try changing it to 9001 (both Netbeans and php.ini).

Answer 6: 

    
    
Sublime Text is a really nice Windows editor (commercial, but reasonably priced) that supports TextMate configurations (well, at least for syntax and snippets) so if you manage to get a REBOL bundle from somewhere, you can use it with this.

SciTE also has REBOL syntax coloring support because the Scintilla editor component it's based on includes this. 

Notepad++ should also support REBOL syntax coloring, being Scintilla based, but as it is currently distributed, the support is not compiled in. If you're so inclined, you could probably compile it yourself and add the support back in. It might be worth it because Notepad++ is quite a good editor too.

I use JEdit which not only has REBOL syntax highlighting but also auto-indenting. It has most of the features you'd expect from a text editor (e.g. block selection, configurable keyboard shortcuts).

I use UltraEdit.  

with its advanced project, syntax highlighting, macro, command-line control and total keyboard shortcut configuration, per language and project, you can program the editor to do just about all of what you need at a single click of the mouse, or keyboard.

my setup starts rebol on any file, and assigns a launch "default project script " to a shortcut, so wherever I am in the files, I still launch the project's relevant script.  change project, it will run that new project's scripts.  another key for unit tests, another key for "find in all opened files, etc, etc..

also, the actual text-exiting, when combined with a few macros which create functions, objects, and more using the clipboard and "currently highlighted" text makes it much faster than any Visual IDE including MSVC.

ultra edit itself has thousands of other advanced features, and they all work... really they do.

I've tried other editors and they always fall short when I start to push them.

yeah, you have to buy it... but its cheap (like one or two hours of your life salary ;-)

so considering you might use it for several months or years... its a cheap investment.

also, ultra edit is now released on linux and the mac port is just around the corner.

Title: Jump-To-Code-Line Eclipse Shortcuts
Description: 
    
    
                    
is it possible, in Eclipse, to mark certain lines with Shortcuts and be able to quickly jump to those lines?

Example: Let's say I have maintenanceHeavyMethod() at line 120 in my class, gameLoop() at line 800 and some listener at line 1460.

I'd like to f.ex. press CTRL+SHIFT+1, 2, 3 etc. to mark those positions, and then use f.ex. CTRL+1, 2, 3 to immediately jump to them. I don't like split-screens etc, but I need to jump around when writing.

Is there such a feature?

I'm using latest Eclipse to write Java-programs.

To jump to a particular method, I use ctrl+o and then start typing the method.  If you're a proficient typist, this shouldn't take any longer; keep in mind that you only have to start typing the name of the method.

You can jump to methods by using the outline view. Outline view shows all the Methods, Fields, and Inner-Classes (and their methods and fields and inner-classes...etc) of the source file you currently have open. I personally prefer this method, unless I have a stacktrace and know which line I want to jump to, in which case I use ctrl+L.

Title: alternative IDE for squeak/pharo
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been using smalltalk for a while now and I love the language and the concept. What I just hate is the System browser. This tool doesn't even resemble a modern IDE. How am I supposed to code without tabs, outlines and handy shortcuts? I often find myself implementing a selector and noticing that it would be nice to isolate a piece of code in a separate (private) selector, just for readability shake, but I don't. Because it takes like 5 mouse clicks and I have to navigate away from the selector I am working at, and navigate back to it. Oh wait, I can't! Because it has syntax errors, because I haven't finished it yet! Kills me. And I don't have a 24 inch display to open 3 browsers.

Sorry for a little rant. My question is, is there a real IDE (Eclipse, Net.Beans, VS) for smalltalk? Maybe for some commercial version of smalltalk?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Historically, the real "IDE" is the Smalltalk one, and one could claim that the others are just an adaptation to the limits of traditional textual programming languages (not rethorical, just check out the evolution of typical development environment UIs and how they are adding features that exists in Smalltalk from the very beggining, like the senders and references in VS).

Just a side note: actually more than 2000 open-source projects in the SqueakSource repository were coded without tabs, outlines and shortcuts (I think still in Squeak you can cross reference any text selecting and pressing with Alt-6). I can't tell you how sad I feel when I must to go back to file based developement, still don't understand why most developers love to sweep text, mess with line numbers and page up-down files in directories. The good news for you, is that you have many options:

There is an alternative browser called BobsBrowser (works in Pharo 1.3) which lets you browse


Class hierarchy windows exploring each class
System Category window
Unsaved edits
Recent classes
Recent methods
Method categories for instances and classes
Unsent methods
Driller relating every structural information
etc.


The advantage over the Whisker browser is that the hierarchical lists are attached to a window while in BobsBrowser you can detach them.

It all depends of the different activities you're performing when you're developing. With some experience in Smalltalk you'll find that you prefer some browser for exploratory insights and others for refactorings, etc. BobsBrowser for example is good for knowledge organization or custom navigation of Smalltalk classes and categories, the hierarchies you can see are the organizations from the Smalltalk reflective meta-architecture at any level (classes, senders, implementors), and they are expandable/collapsable (in the classic system browsers you can only expand the system categories and subcategories).

The instance variables were shown historically in the Smalltalk/V flavors, and there is an old goodie (from Squeak 2.7 IIRC) to enable it back again but almost nobody today maintains the classic System Browser in Squeak/Pharo. Adding that feature to OmniBrowser would be more complicated though because is a browser framework (as every serious framework, it took some time to learn it for the first time), although the effort of the Squeak/Pharo community is absolutely incredible, still the Smalltalk community needs more developers.

You have also a commercial Smalltalk which isn't public (downloadable) yet but includes IDE-like features of traditional programming environments
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You might want to check out tODE. It's at a very early stage, but it is an attempt to provide a Smalltalk IDE in the web-browser and is a break from the traditional Smalltalk IDE. With that said, I don't think you'd want to start using tODE right away, but you can keep an eye on it as it evolves.

Title: Why don&#39;t IDEs support dynamic formatting?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Given all the holy wars surrounding various code formatting styles, and many companies' strict formatting requirements, why don't IDEs allow dynamic reformatting of code?
By that I mean have the IDE format the code the way the user wants it every time, and save the code without any formatting at all. (Well maybe line breaks so that diffs are still easy)
The user wouldn't have to worry about adhering to a coding standard, people wouldn't get bent out of shape over working in code that's not formatted just how they like it, and formatting changes wouldn't show up in repository diffs.
There's have to be some mechanism for turning it off so it doesn't screw up old, pre-formatted code, but otherwise, what's keeping this from becoming a standard feature?

Edit: I'm aware that some IDEs have an reformat feature, but that causes almost as many problems as it solves -- source control diffs become nearly useless as the actual changes are lost in a sea of insignificant formatting changes, and different tab character widths still knock things out of alignment. Also, it doesn't let programmers work with the code in their preferred format.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Because most people like to see the code as it will be committed. Unless all of the tools you use to view your code (diff programs, grep, web based source repository viewers, etc) understand how to dynamically format the code the same way, you're going to be confused by different formattings when you look at it in your IDE vs. the other tools.

I agree it would be nice if we had more structural programming tools, rather than fixed width text tools, but it would require updating everything in your tool chain to really make it workable.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I think Eclipse allows you to format code however you like.

EDIT: Yeah, the Java Code Formatter formats based on rules you set in the project.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I've thought this would be a good idea too, but as a function of the source control software rather than the IDE.

Code could be stored as a list of tokens and then reconstructed when copied to the development machine. This answers aleemb's point as no white space is ever stored. There might need to be more sophisticated formatting rules to cope with all cases though.

It also answers Martin Harris' concerns - the code on your machine wouldn't contain any special characters just white space between tokens.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I think that the files that live on your actual machine in most cases should be in a common text format, it is beyond useful to be able to open up any source code file that I'm working on in notepad or any other handy text editor. Because of this I wouldn't want my local copies to contain any special characters that the IDE interprets as "This is an indent, please use a tab or a space here as you feel is appropriate". My opinion is that the best point to do this kind of formatting is the source control system, you check a file in formatted as you like, I check it out formatted as I like.

A while back I asked this question about source control tools not understanding code and ascalonx's answer pointing me towards source control in database. It's a shame that this idea doesn't seem to have more traction since it would solve both our problems and much more. I'm a .NET developer so I'm very much out in the cold with this at the moment, but apparently Eclipse and IntelliJ in the Java world are getting closer to this ideal (I don't know how close, since I've never used either)
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I think that the biggest hurdle would be reconstructing the source code comments since they have no formal semantics - I'm not talking about JavaDocs or the like but rather the comments that are placed inline with the sources. Without semantic rules for source code comments the whole concept falls apart.

Sure you can version control the AST, but how will you map the comments onto the AST nodes? 

A naive approach would be to associate comments with statements in the language, but what if I have a comment that applies to "the next 3 lines" and then someone moves one of the lines somewhere else. Where does the comment go?
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I am sure there are programs and scripts available that format the code in the way you specify. 

While some IDE's support such reformatting of code (Eclipse, Intellij for Java, Wing for Python, VS2007? for .net), even if they dont, it should be a matter of just running those scripts on the source code.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
If you can handle the following scenario I would think it's a good idea but my hunch is that it's not trivial, which means that it's not intuitive and predictable which is bad for user experience.

If the code is written:

if(value!=null)


and dynamic formatter shows:

if (value != null)


and I modify it to:

if ((value != null) &amp;&amp; (value.Length &gt; 0))


and then another developer dynamically formats it to:

if ( (value != null) &amp;&amp; (value.Length &gt; 0) )


and changes some other line in the code and saves it. Does the above formatting also get saved? How do you reconcile the different formatting preferences of the two developers because his new additions will in a different format.

You'd have to store in a common format but even so the line lengths would be different and the developers would break the line at different positions for 80 or 100 char wrapping and it gets quite messy.

Title: Why bundle version a control plugin with an IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I was always wondering why it is a big deal having version control support inside an IDE.
I always preferred to use a command-line/standalone version of the version control of choice and never found IDE integration helpful.
I know it can be helpful sometimes, for example to automatically keep track of renames, but I was bitten by version control plugins a couple of times (especially the ClearCase Eclipse plugin) that I'm now finding it counter productive compared to the command-line version, where I have better control.
What is your opinion?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Integration of the IDE with version control and, in particular, software change management (SCM) helps bringing together the philosophies of the IDE and the source control system.
One example is temporary files and binaries, that should not be checked-in and, e.g. in Visual Studio, end up within the source directory if you're not carefully creating new project and solution templates with a non-default directory configuration.
Another could be tracking of work items and complex bug fixes.
Also it saves some ceremony and context-switching when editing files.
Advanced integrations may also allow to push the change management system's concept of &quot;configuration&quot; (&quot;branch&quot;, &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;view&quot;) into the IDE.
ClearCase integration, however, is clearly not &quot;advanced&quot;.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Integrated Source Control also helps to only keep the important files under Source control. For example, when I add a new File in Visual Studio, the Plugin (visualSVN) will allow me to add it easily without me having to remember to go outside of my IDE and run the command to add it to the repository. On the other hand, it will automatically ignore temporary files, like the obj/ and bin/ Folders.

Essentially: Integrated Version Control that actually works is a great way to keep the repository clean and complete.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I like how some IDE's implement this. Ankh-SVN for Visual Studio is not that great and is a bit buggy, however Subeclipse I find to work exceedingly well when I'm using Eclipse.

I think it really depends on the IDE you're using and the quality of that plug-in. It's going to work well for some setups and terrible for others.

That's why I like Subversion with Tortoise SVN so much. I can choose to use the IDE integration when and where it makes sense, otherwise, just like you said, I can simply use the command line or in my case, the windows explorer based client!
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
A lot of it is simply the preference and comfort level of the user.  Some folks are comfortable with the command line.  Some prefer a GUI.

I wouldn't make generalized assumptions that all version control within the IDE is bad or buggy based on experiences with a particular plugin which had issues.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Why even have an IDE?  Why not just do everything with a command line? ;)

The answer is that having it integrated with the IDE is "better".

My #1 reason:
You can visually see if a file is checked out or not, and if you need to edit a file, you can take the action right there where you are working.

There are more, but that is the big one.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
It's depend on your IDE and the way you work with VCS.

Me and my team using VSS plugin-ins inside Delphi IDE, it gives a lot of flexibable feature when working together for example, All our forms are check-in when you start to write a letter or move components it asked if you want to check-out the code file or form.

also when some one change any code in other forms, it pop up and telling you it's already update by someone else and asking you to update current files in your H.D.

and you just get everything while you are in the IDE, you don't need to move to other external file, or command prompt to do a simple task.

I find most people who like to deal with command prompt working mostly in code without GUI IDE or may I be wrong.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Nearly all of my subversion needs can be handled by the IDE interface.  It's a lot faster to do 2 quick clicks than pop up a command line, cd to the right place, issue the command, etc.

Command line has it's place, but with the current crop of IDEs, that place continues to shrink.
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
I have battle scars from using a buggy implementation of an IDE/VCS integration.  In all honesty, if it was not buggy it would have been great.  As long as there are great tools like TortoiseSVN, I don't see a need for IDE/VCS integration.  I'd rather have more tools that do their job well than a few buggy tools.
    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
Version control support in an IDE generally gives you a better view. The IDE actually knows what type of file you are looking at when doing a diff, which means it can do context highlighting and help you do merges more effectively.

I also think it saves setup time. In stead of installing all kinds of tools, a developer can download the IDE, do a checkout an be on it's way. If every developer on a project uses the same IDE, they can help eachother.

"Counterproductive" is a large word. If you have serious CVS/SVN problems maybe once a month, it's still way to few to have complicated clients installed on all your dev machines.
    
    
Answer 10: 

    
    
I have both systems where there is an integrated IDE (Microsoft FrontPage against an IIS Development Web site with Visual Source Safe on all of the web content) and where there is not (java command-line development, Visual Studio Express Editions).  An intermediate case that I use is jEdit 4.x with VSS integration via plug-in.

I think the integrated case is valuable for the reason it always is -- you don't have to leave your application to interact with source-control functions and you don't have to worry about remembering to add new files and to check out files before editing them.  The ability to have a smooth work process and to minimize the risk of oversights is powerful, as far as I am concerned.  Even when the IDE-plugin integration is less than perfect (the jEdit 4.x case), I still prefer it over not having it.

I also agree that having explorer integration on Windows, the case for Tortoise SVN, is also a great capability, even when IDE integration is available.  This allows convenient operation without having to launch the IDE while also being able to launch from the explorer window into the IDE (depending on file type) or editor or make or whatever while operating in Windows Explorer.

And yes, the command-line interfaces remain valuable, especially for scripting of recuring-operation patterns.

I operate in many contexts.  Having low barriers and fluidity of operation in all of them is to be prized.
    
    
Answer 11: 

    
    
I'm not sure I understand the question. IDEs by definition are integrated, meaning that they're supposed to help you avoid the need to get out of the environment for anything project-related. Version control obviously fits the bill.

If you're looking for more practical reasons, one is that IDEs can offer you awareness by the nature of their graphical presentation. Eclipse, for example, will present files and directories that have changed. With additional plugins or suites, you can ever get real-time awareness as soon as another user is editing the same file, helping you predict a merge conflict before it occurs. I'm not familiar with a commandline based mechanism.
    
    
Answer 12: 

    
    
I use intellij integrated with cvs on a regular basis and by far the best feature of the integration of version control inside the IDE is line-by-line indications of what is added, edited, or deleted along with easy access (mouse hover/tool tip) to the pre-edit changes.

This is all within the source code in a non-obtrusive way. 

For the nuts and bolts of version control (checkin/checkout/update/etc) I sometimes use the IDE and sometimes use the command line.
    
    
Answer 13: 

    
    
The number 1 reason for an SCM integrated with the IDE is that it makes it more effortless to use it and eliminates the need to REMEMBER to check things out. Through experience I have seen that steps that developers construe as extraneous, which often encompases anything other than writing code, don't get done. Making them do extra steps increases the odds that developers won't bother with it and will work around the source control system
    
    
Title: toLowerCase or capitalize functions for Sublime Text 2 Snippets
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is it possible to define some sort of capitalize() or toLowerCase() function when creating Sublime Text 2 Snippets?

For example:

&lt;snippet&gt;
&lt;content&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;?php
class ${1} extends Datamapper
{
    var \$has_one = array();
    var \$has_many = array();
    var \$table = '${1}s';
    //constructor and other stuff next...
}
?&gt;
]]&gt;&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;tabTrigger&gt;dmm&lt;/tabTrigger&gt;
&lt;/snippet&gt;


This particular snippet helps me create Datamapper ORM models on the fly. When I type dmm the Snippet is fired and my cursor is placed in two areas at the same time; the class's name &amp; the assignment to $table. The first cursor requires capitalization whereas the second cursor should not. Can I force the Snippet's case? Something like {1.toLowerCase}

Simple example, but I can think of other times when I could use this.

Here's how to change the shortcut key for a Visual Studio menu, using the 'Test' menu as an example:


Go to Tools, Customize.
Click the Commands tab.
Ensure the Menu bar option is selected, and that Menu Bar is chosen for editing from the drop-down (this is the primary application menu bar).
In the Controls section, click on the Test menu.
Click on the Modify Selection ▼ button.
Change the text for the Name property:


Any letter prefixed with an '&amp;' ampersand will act as the shortcut key.
The ampersand is not required if you don't need to reach this menu with the keyboard.

Press Enter to keep the setting.



  
  
  'Modify Selection' for the Test menu

Isn't this something the fault of the Windows API, not Visual Studio?  I think the Alt (and nothing else) keyboard shortcuts are directed through Windows API, so the OS will probably not let you do this; it'll select the menu with the respective mnemonic (underlined letter).  

You could try using a custom keyboard layout that would swap the left ctrl and left alt keys, allowing you to use "ctrl-S" but it feels like command-S.

Good Luck!

go to tools -options - keyboard(you may have to choose show all option or something like that to be able to see this one) and you can change the shortcuts
    
    
Title: Netbeans scanning of project too slow
Description: 
    
    
                    
I use netbeans 7.3.1,  i have found here one way how to make netbeans faster: How to improve Netbeans performance?, but my problem is that my netbeans is to slow by project scanning, is projectcanning important for the software netbeans? My projects are in network and not on my pc. I have also found this plugin, but there is no more available: http://wiki.netbeans.org/ScanOnDemand

My CPU is Intel quad 2.40GHz.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Try to disable auto-scanning of sources. Make sure that you only modify the sources via Netbeans. According to the manual:

Enable auto-scanning of sources
When selected, the IDE will scan the source code of projects to detect any files that were modified externally. Scanning is triggered when the focus is returned to the IDE, for example when the user returns to the IDE from another application.
If your sources are only modified from within the IDE, you can probably disable auto-scanning with little risk of encountering problems. Disabling auto-scanning may improve IDE performance if you are working on large projects.
Auto-scanning is enabled by default.



Other than that it the network that causes the delay. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The previous answer didn't work for me. But if your OS is Windows, I only found one way to significantly decrease the amount of time it takes to open my remote project and hopefully it will work for you.


Open Programs and Features.
Select Turn Windows features on or off.
Uncheck Remote Differential Compression.




Beyond disabling that, depending on the size of your project, netbeans indexes your project during each launch in order to track changes that have been made. Application modules are also cached which causes a further delay as well.

One more thing you can try which may help if your project or netbeans version has significantly changed, and was recommended in the comments above, is to clear the cache.

You can either rename the folder, or delete it (netbeans will recreate it).

Title: Is it safe to remove the declaration of a form from the unit?
Description: 
    
    
                    
When designing a TForm, a line is added to the form's unit declaring the form object...

var
  frmMyForm: TfrmMyForm;


I don't need this form auto-created, and I intend to create multiple instances of it, and to make sure I don't make the mistake of using this declared form, I commented it out...

//var
  //frmMyForm: TfrmMyForm;


I was wondering if this is safe to do? I don't see any problems, and the form designer still works fine. But could there be some trouble if I leave this out completely?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is a very common scenario when using form inheritance. You normally don't want to instantiate derived forms from the middle of the inheritance chain.

The only place where these form variables are used (besides your code perhaps) is the dpr file and that only when the form is autocreated.

So, no problem to remove the declaration.

I run the following command as a pre-Build event in Visual Studio 2005 and it works fine:

SubWCRev.exe "C:\work\subversion\aviOffline .Net\trunk" 
"c:\test.tmpl" 
"c:\testout.txt"C:\work\subversion\aviOffline .Net\trunk"


So I change the command to use the in-built Visual Studio macros for better maintainability but it fails.  It appears to fail on the $(SolutionDir) macro because it appends a trailing backslash and SubWCRev.exe seems to not like the trailing backslash?

"SubWCRev.exe" "$(SolutionDir)" "c:\test.tmpl" "c:\testout.txt"


Is there a dos command or another way that removes the trailing backslash?

Title: What GUI should I run with JUnit(similar to NUnit gui)
Description: 
    
    
                    
What GUI should use to run my JUnit tests, and how exactly do I do that? My entire background is in .NET, so I'm used to just firing up my NUnit gui and running my unit tests. If the lights are green, I'm clean. 

Now, I have to write some Java code and want to run something similar using JUnit. The JUnit documentation is nice and clear about adding the attributes necessary to create tests, but its pretty lean on how to fire up a runner and see the results of those tests.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Eclipse is by-far the best I've used.  Couple JUnit with a code coverage plug-in and Eclipse will probably be the best unit-tester.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
JUnit stopped having graphical runners following the release of JUnit 4.

If you do have an earlier version of JUnit you can use a graphical test runner by entering on the command line[1]:


java junit.swingui.TestRunner [optional TestClass]


With the optional test class the specified tests will run straight away. Without it you can enter the class into the GUI.

The benefits of running your tests this way is that you don't have the overhead of an entire IDE (if you're not already running one). However, if you're already working in an IDE such as Eclipse, the integration is excellent and is a lot less hassle to get the test running.

If you do have JUnit 4, and really don't want to use an IDE to run the tests, or want textual feedback, you can run the text UI test runner. In a similar vein as earlier, this can be done by entering on the command line[1]:


java junit.textui.TestRunner [TestClass]


Though in this case the TestClass is not optional, for obvious reasons.

[1] assuming you're in the correct working directory and the classpath has been setup, which may be out of scope for this answer
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
There's a standalone JUnit runner that has a UI, but I recommend using one of the builtin test runners in the Java IDEs (Eclipse, Netbeans, and IntelliJ all have good ones).  They all support JUnit, and most support TestNG as well.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
If you want a standalone test runner (not the build-in IDE one), then for Junit3 you can use


junit.textui.TestRunner %your_class% - command line based runner
junit.swingui.TestRunner [%your_class%] - runner with user interface (swing-powered)


For Junit4, the UI-powered runners were removed and so far I haven't found a convenient solution to run new Junit4 tests on old swing-powered runner without additional libraries. But you can use JUnit 4 Extensions that provides a workaround to use junit.swingui.TestRunner. More here
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Why you need a GUI runner? Can't you just run the tests from the IDE itself?

In .Net we have TestDriven.net, in Java there must be something equivalent. You can check out IntelliJ IDEA, it has the unit testing support built-in.

I usually put the documentation in the interface if I can:



interface SenderInterface

    /**
     * Sends Email to user
     *
     * @param UserInterface $receiver
     * @param string $msg

    public function sendEmail(UserInterface $receiver, $msg)
    //...
    {


I then inherit the doc like this to avoid redundancy.

class Sender implements SenderInterface
{
    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    public function sendEmail(UserInterface $receiver, $msg)
    //...
    {


Is there a way to see the inherited doc directly into the Sender class without having to open the SenderInterface in PHPStorm?

Title: How can I implement my own custom property editor for all instances of a certain type?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have followed a few tutorials on creating a custom property editor dialog, but there are so many things involved that I could not get it to work right. What I am trying to accomplish is a custom form with a date picker (calendar), a time picker, and OK and Cancel buttons. The form is no problem at all, but how would I go about implementing this so that I can publish a property in any component of a certain type with a button to launch the property editor?

I would like to completely override the TDateTime type and put my custom editor in its place, so wherever a TDateTime is published and visible in the Object Inspector, I can use this editor to modify both date and time together in the same window.

The problem is that the documentation on creating a custom property editor is poor and although some resources are very thorough, they go into too much detail of the capabilities and lack getting to the point on the most common scenarios.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I did not want to ask this question here and expect anyone to answer it for me, so I did the research myself to solve my issues and I would like to share the unique experience involved in this mini project, as I'm sure others are frustrated with the same thing.

There are many different possibilities with custom property editors, dialogs, and component editors. This in particular would call for a TDateTimeProperty descendant. This would allow you to be able to edit the value of the property directly in the Object Inspector as plain text (String) while keeping the DateTime formatting.

I am assuming that you already have a general knowledge of creating custom components and a package in which you can publish this property editor from, because that's a lesson in its own which I will not cover. This calls for just one line of code to be placed inside the Register procedure, but we'll get to that later.

First, you need to create a new form in your Design-Time package, where your components are registered. Name the unit DateTimeProperty.pas, and name the form DateTimeDialog (thus making the form's class TDateTimeDialog). Place whatever controls you need, in this case a TMonthCalendar, TDateTimePicker (with Kind set to dtkTime), and 2 TBitBtn controls, one labeled OK with ModalResult of mrOK and the other labeled Cancel with ModalResult of mrCancel.

Your unit should look something like this:

unit DateTimeProperty;

interface

uses
  Winapi.Windows, Winapi.Messages, System.SysUtils, System.Variants,
  System.Classes, Vcl.Graphics, Vcl.Controls, Vcl.Forms, Vcl.Dialogs,
  Vcl.ComCtrls, Vcl.StdCtrls, Vcl.Buttons;

type
  TDateTimeDialog = class(TForm)
    dtDate: TMonthCalendar;
    dtTime: TDateTimePicker;
    BitBtn1: TBitBtn;
    BitBtn2: TBitBtn;
  private

  public

  end;         

var
  DateTimeDialog: TDateTimeDialog;

implementation

{$R *.dfm}

end.


And here is the DFM code behind this form:

object DateTimeDialog: TDateTimeDialog
  Left = 591
  Top = 158
  BorderIcons = [biSystemMenu]
  BorderStyle = bsToolWindow
  Caption = 'Pick Date/Time'
  ClientHeight = 231
  ClientWidth = 241
  Color = clBtnFace
  Font.Charset = DEFAULT_CHARSET
  Font.Color = clWindowText
  Font.Height = -11
  Font.Name = 'Tahoma'
  Font.Style = []
  OldCreateOrder = False
  Position = poScreenCenter
  DesignSize = (
    241
    231)
  PixelsPerInch = 96
  TextHeight = 13
  object dtDate: TMonthCalendar
    Left = 8
    Top = 31
    Width = 225
    Height = 166
    Anchors = [akLeft, akRight, akBottom]
    Date = 41261.901190613430000000
    TabOrder = 1
  end
  object dtTime: TDateTimePicker
    Left = 8
    Top = 8
    Width = 113
    Height = 21
    Date = 41261.000000000000000000
    Time = 41261.000000000000000000
    Kind = dtkTime
    TabOrder = 2
  end
  object BitBtn1: TBitBtn
    Left = 158
    Top = 200
    Width = 75
    Height = 25
    Caption = 'OK'
    Default = True
    ModalResult = 1
    TabOrder = 0
  end
  object BitBtn2: TBitBtn
    Left = 77
    Top = 200
    Width = 75
    Height = 25
    Caption = 'Cancel'
    ModalResult = 2
    TabOrder = 3
  end
end


Now, add DesignEditors and DesignIntf to your uses clause. Make sure you have DesignIDE declared in the Requires of this Design-Time package. This is required for publishing any property editors.

In the form, create a new public property called DateTime of type TDateTime with a property getter and setter. This property will allow you to easily read/write the full TDateTime value the selection actually represents. So you should have this in your form:

private
  function GetDateTime: TDateTime;
  procedure SetDateTime(const Value: TDateTime);
public
  property DateTime: TDateTime read GetDateTime write SetDateTime;

....

function TDateTimeDialog.GetDateTime: TDateTime;
begin
  Result:= Int(dtDate.Date) + Frac(dtTime.Time);
end;

procedure TDateTimeDialog.SetDateTime(const Value: TDateTime);
begin
  dtDate.Date:= Value;
  dtTime.DateTime:= Value;
end;


Next we need to add the actual property editor class. Create this class just beneath the {$R *.dfm} which is just under implementation:

type
  TDateTimeEditor = class(TDateTimeProperty)
  public
    procedure Edit; override;
    function GetAttributes: TPropertyAttributes; override;
    function GetValue: String; override;
    procedure SetValue(const Value: String); override;
  end;

procedure TDateTimeEditor.Edit;
var
  F: TDateTimeDialog;
begin
  //Initialize the property editor window
  F:= TDateTimeDialog.Create(Application);
  try
    F.DateTime:= GetFloatValue;
    if F.ShowModal = mrOK then begin
      SetFloatValue(F.DateTime);
    end;
  finally
    F.Free;
  end;
end;

function TDateTimeEditor.GetAttributes: TPropertyAttributes;
begin
  //Makes the small button show to the right of the property
  Result := inherited GetAttributes + [paDialog];
end;

function TDateTimeEditor.GetValue: String;
begin
  //Returns the string which should show in Object Inspector
  Result:= FormatDateTime('m/d/yy h:nn:ss ampm', GetFloatValue);
end;

procedure TDateTimeEditor.SetValue(const Value: String);
begin
  //Assigns the string typed in Object Inspector to the property
  inherited;
end;


Finally, we need to add a Register procedure to perform the actual registration of this new property editor:

procedure Register;
begin
  RegisterPropertyEditor(TypeInfo(TDateTime), nil, '', TDateTimeEditor);
end;


Now there's an important piece to understand in this call to RegisterPropertyEditor. Since the 2nd and 3rd parameters are nil and an empty string, this means the editor will apply to all instances of TDateTime. Look into this procedure for more information about making it specific to certain components and property instances.

And here's the final result after installing...



Some good resources for custom property editors which contributed are as follows:
