Title: Using newest 2013 MS cc compiler into older visual studio 2010 interface?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I wanted to know if anybody had the experience of configuring this : http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=41151
into visual studio 2010 ?

I have only Windows Vista on some of my machines; and I'd like to code using a 2012 or 2013 compiler. I know visual studio is greatly configurable and can plug various compilers (like sony for PS Vita is providing a configuration for gcc based compiler in visual studio).

VS 2012 and 2013 express cannot be installed on Vista. But I see no reason why the compiler; a purely command line tool, wouldn't work on Vista. (because it wouldn't dare to need that darn K32GetModuleInformation thingie. I bet MS called this function for purely phony purposes of forcing people to upgrade their OS)

thanks !

ps : of course a trick to make vs 2013 express (for desktop) installable on vista would also be appreciated.
    

        
Title: Problems persisting dockable form layout in the Delphi IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've written a small IDE extension for Delphi. My form descends from TDockableToolbarForm. I've figured out how to get the IDE to save the form's position in the .dst and .dsk files.

The form's registration looks like this:

procedure Register;
begin
  RegisterFieldAddress('MyForm', @MyForm);
  RegisterDesktopFormClass(TMyForm, 'My Form', 'MyForm');
  MyForm := TMyForm.Create(nil);
  MyForm.Show;
end;


and I added the following OnCreate handler to the form:

procedure TMyForm.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  inherited;
  AutoSave :=True;
  SaveStateNecessary := True;
  DeskSection := 'My Form';
end;


This caused the following to be written to the dst/dsk files:

[My Form]
PercentageSizes=1
Create=1
Visible=0
Docked=1
State=0
Left=0
Top=0
Width=1193
Height=4115
MaxLeft=-1
MaxTop=-1
ClientWidth=1109
ClientHeight=3788
TBDockHeight=4115
LRDockWidth=1193
Dockable=1
StayOnTop=0


This allows the form's layout to persist between one run of the IDE and the next. However I'm having two problems:


When the package is first registered with the IDE I'd like the form to be docked on the left side by default (assuming the user isn't using the 'Classic Undocked' layout). Right now it's simply showing the form undocked.
When the package is uninstalled/reinstalled the form isn't using the previously saved layout settings. It again appears undocked.


I suspect both problems are cause by a missed step but I'm at a loss as to what that step is.

For the first problem I found TControl.ManualDock mentioned quite often in discussions about docking but it was always in reference to applications for which you have access to the source. I have no idea how to retrieve the necessary parameters from the IDE to call it.

For the second problem the only thing I know for sure is that the settings in the dst file are still present after the package has been uninstalled so I would think reinstalling the package would simple using the existing settings but that doesn't appear to be the case.
    

        
Title: Get IntelliJ to show compilation problems automatically [duplicate]
Description: 
    
    
                    
Yesterday I switched to IntelliJ IDEA from Eclipse. 

I am using JRebel with WebSphere Server 7 as well.

Everything now seems to be working somewhat fine, except that when I modify a Java file, and hit save, IntelliJ does not re-compile the file, in order for JRebel to pick it up. 

The Eclipse "Build Automatically" feature resolved this issue. 

In IntelliJ IDEA, I have to hit CTRL+SHIFT+9 to re-compile the relevant class for JRebel to pick it up. If changes are done across two files, I have to do this on each and one of them and since IntelliJ uses the save all mechanism, its pretty hard to know what to recompile manually which I am not really interested in doing either.

Isn't there a way to make IntelliJ to do this on its own?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
UPDATED

For IntelliJ IDEA 12+ releases we can build automatically the edited sources if we are using the external compiler option. The only thing needed is to check the option "Build project automatically", located under "Compiler" settings:



Also, if you would like to hot deploy, while the application is running or if you are using spring boot devtools you should enable the compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running from registry too. This will automatically compile your changes. 

Using Ctrl+Shift+A (or ⌘+Shift+A on Mac) type Registry once the registry windows is open, locate and enable compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running, see here:




For versions older than 12, you can use the EclipseMode plugin to make IDEA automatically compile the saved files.

For more tips see the "Migrating From Eclipse to IntelliJ IDEA" guide.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Please follow both steps:
1 - Enable Automake from the compiler

Press: ctrl + shift + A (For Mac ⌘ + shift + A)
Type: make project automatically
Hit: Enter
Enable Make Project automatically feature

2 - Enable Automake when the application is running

Press: ctrl + shift + A (For Mac ⌘ + shift + A)
Type: Registry
Find the key compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running and enable it or click the checkbox next to it

Note: Restart your application now :)
Note: This should also allow live reload with spring boot devtools.

WARNING

Eclipse Mode plug-in is obsolete and is not compatible with the recent IDEA 12+ builds. If you install it, IDE will hang on every file change and will respond extremely slow.



IntelliJ IDEA doesn't use automatic build, it detects errors on the fly, not via compiler. Similar to Eclipse mode will be available in IDEA 12:



Use Build | Make, it invokes the incremental make process that will compile only changed and dependent files (it's very fast).

There is also a FAQ entry that may help.

Update on the automatic make feature:
When run/debug configuration is running, Make project automatically has no effect. Classes on disk will change only on Build | Make. It's the core design decision as in our opinion class changes on disk should be always under user's control. Automatic make is not the copycat of Eclipse feature, it works differently and it's main purpose is to save time waiting for the classes to be ready when they are really needed (before running the app or tests). Automatic make doesn't replace the explicit compilation that you still need to trigger like in the case described in this question. If you are looking for different behavior, EclipseMode plug-in linked in the FAQ above would be a better choice.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
You can keymap ctrl+s to save AND compile in one step.  Go to the keymap settings and search for Compile.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
There is actually no difference as both require 1 click:


Eclipse: manual Save, auto-compile. 
IntelliJ: auto Save, manual compile.


Simplest solution is just to get used to it. Because when you spend most of your daytime in your IDE, then better have fast habits in one than slow habits in several of them.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I ended up recording a Macro to save and compile in one step, and keymap Ctrl+s to it.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
I managed to solve this using macros.

I started recording a macro:


Click Edit - Macros - Start macro recording
Click File - Save All
Click Build - Make Project
Click Edit - Macros - Stop macro recording


Name it something useful like, "SaveAndMake".

Now just remove the Save all keybinding, and add the same keybinding to your macro! 

So now, every time i save, it saves and makes a dirty compile, and jRebel now detects all changes correctly.
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
Please follow these steps carefully to enable it. 

1) create Spring Boot project with SB V1.3 and add "Devtools" (1*) to dependencies 

2) invoke Help-em/em/pp
Answer 9: 

    
    
The only thing that worked for me in my maven project that was affected by this is to add a "test-compile" goal to the run configuration of my unit tests. Incredibly clumsy solution, but it works.


    
    
Answer 10: 

    
    
Intellij fails quietly when it encounters compile problem in other module, and then automatic build is not performed. So check your Problems window
    
    
Answer 11: 

    
    
I had the same issue.
I was using the "Power save mode", which prevents from compiling incrementally and showing compilation errors.

It was not working for me due to having an unnecessary module in my project structure. The tests were executed using the other module, I suppose. 

I don't know how it ended up like that but removing it solved the problem.

Make sure your Run/Debug settings are using the module you are building with the autosave.

E.g. : see the module in

I had the same issue. I think it would be appropriate to check whether your class can be compiled or not. Click recompile (Ctrl+Shift+F9 by default). If its not working then you have to investigate why it isn't compiling.

In my case the code wasn't autocompiling because there were hidden errors with compilation (they weren't shown in logs anywhere and maven clean-install was working). The rootcause was incorrect Project Structure -/p/div

Not enough points to comment on an existing answer, but similar to some people above, I wound up just adding a macro &amp; keymap to Organize Imports / Format / SaveAll / FastReload(F9) / Synchronize.

The synchronize is added as it seems to be the only way I can also see updates in resources modified by external build tools / watchers (i.e., webpack).

The process is slower than eclipse - and for the external file refresh often have to run the command multiple times - but suppose I can live with it.

Answer 1: 

    
    
This depends on the version of VS you are using.

For Visual Studio 2013 you can show the "Autos" window, it dynamically displays all return values of functions you step over while debugging. You can find the Autos Window here: Debug =
Answer 2: 

    
    
What about using a trace statement.  I'm assuming you want to know what the result of each call on the call stack is when debugging the recursion.  

Note: Having the trace statement at the top of the function will order the output, to the console, from first to last.

For example:

void Factorial(int n) {

    Trace.WriteLine(n);

    if (n == 0)
       return 1;
    else
       return (n * factorial(n-1));

I am writing C++ on OS X, and the best IDE I've found yet is Xcode. But the automatic code completion is weird. The suggestion will appear only after two or three seconds. To be specific, while I type

str


the list that contains suggestions including string and other identifiers won't appear until I stop typing and wait for 2 or 3 seconds. So basically, the auto completion is UNUSABLE!!

Strangely though, the auto code completion is super fast in the main() function.

Is there any explanation to such strange behavior of the automatic code completion in Xcode when writing C++?

I am getting an error while compiling a jade file on my mac. I have already read too many blog posts but the problem still exits. 

Here is a screenshot of the error I am getting:



Can anyone tell me how i can setup jade in Webstrom MAC.

In terminal when i am trying to compile using this command i got error no: 156

mandeepgill-macpro:htdocs mandeepgill$ cd HTMLCodes

                             ^
Error: EISDIR, open 'main.html'
mandeepgill-macpro:public_html mandeepgill$

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The EISDIR error is caused when a Node application expects a file, but gets a directory.

This particular instance of that error was thrown by this block of code:

fs.writeFile(path, output, function(err){
          if (err) throw err;
          console.log('  \033[90mrendered \033[36m%s\033[0m', path);
        });


You can tell because it's not error number 156, but the line number of the relevant code.

Do you, by any chance have a directory named main.html in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/HTMLCodes/Sports/public_html?

Also, you should be able to just execute the command, jade main.jade without the second argument. That would seem to make your life easier.

Though if your dead set on using Webstorm on a Mac, this configuration should work equally well, or to keep it really simple, just put $FileName$ in arguments and get rid of the output paths.

This seems to have been a fairly common problem with Webstorm watchers though, so you might want to just use the command line jade --watch.

Some IDE's like PyCharm offer ability to mark parts of source code with # TODO tags with further ability to locate all the tags later on.

Is there any way to convert them into "Issues" after commit was made to Butbucket or Github?

I find it might be very useful to create TODO's on the fly while writing code, so then other contributors may view them on online repository, like Bitbucket.

Bitbucket and Github have a lot of addons or "services", but I couldn't find similar functionality anywhere.

There is a cloud based solution called Todofy (https://todofy.org), it lists out all the todos in the repository, and keep tracking its state untill its finished (removed from code). It provides more features like adding deadline, reminders, assigning someone or bringing someone to discussion, labels etc. 

Example comment with prettifiers (C++ style comment)

// TODO: something has to be done quickly @deadline: 1 week
// @assign: mebjas @priority: high


It has an option to auto create issue for it in Github.

I have created a node module to do exactly what you needed, to adapt it to your usage, you will have to create a package.json file, in which you mention the url of your github repository, and then you will have to create a .fixme-to-issue file and include your github credentials as well as the configuration for the annotations (if the module finds a //TODO, it creates an issue with label todos for example).
to install the module: 

npm install -g fixme-to-issue

Here is a pretty strait forward python script. It uses Githubpy to interact with github. It goes through your current directory tree and grabs the given files (in this case *.cpp and *.h). It then goes through each one of those files finds any #TODO and creates a github issue. It then changes that line to be TODO [GH]:

gh = GitHub(username=user, password=password)

path = '.'

configfiles = [os.path.join(dirpath, f)
    for dirpath, dirnames, files in os.walk(path)
    for extension in extensions
    for f in fnmatch.filter(files, ["*.cpp", "*.h")]

import fileinput
for fileName in configfiles:
    count = 0
    search = fileinput.input(fileName, inplace = 1)
    for line in search: #TODO [GH12]: to
        line = line.rstrip()  # remove '\n' at end of line
        if re.match("(.*)(\#)TODO:(.*)", line):
            todoInfo= re.sub("(.*)(\#)TODO:\s","", line)
            fileNameShort = re.sub("\.\/","", fileName)
            subject = fileNameShort+":"+str(count)+" " + todoInfo
            # make url that can link to specific place in file
            url = "https://github.com/"+projectAccount + "/" + project + "/blob/master/" + fileNameShort + "#L" + str(count)
            r = gh.repos(projectAccount)(project).issues.post(title=subject, body=url)
            line = re.sub("(\#)TODO:","#TODO [GH"+str(r.number)+"]:", line)
        print(line) #write line back to file
        count = count + 1

In Eclipse Juno we have a Quick-Assist for converting Switch to If-else. Is there a way to add a Quick-Fix or similar shortcut for the opposite action: converting If-else to Switch ?

For example convert:

if (kind == 1) {
  return -1;
} else if (kind == 2) {
  return -2;
} else {
  return 0;
}


To:

switch (kind) {
  case 1: return -1;
  case 2: return -2;
  default: return 0;
}

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Interesting question. If it's possible to add a quick-fix for converting if-else to switch, then how would the Assist convert if-else statements with boolean expression that contain more than one variable to switch statement ?

Let's say, we want to convert this if-else statement to switch:

if (x == 1 &amp;&amp; y == 1) {
   //do something
} else if (x == 1 &amp;&amp; y == 3) {
   //do something else
} else if (x == 2 &amp;&amp; y == 1) {
   //and so on.
}


This would result in:

switch (x) {
   case 1 : {
      switch (y) {
         case 1: // do something
         case 3: // and so on  
      }
      break;
   }
   case 2 : {
      switch (y) {
         case 1: //do something else
      }
      break;
   }
}


Personally, I wouldn't like to convert if-else with more complex boolean statements to switch, because the generated code could be very difficult to read and (maybe) wouldn't meet some Good Practices conventions. In simplier cases, like the one you've posted, it's not very difficult and wouldn't take so much time and effort for you to convert it.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there an WebGL intelligent IDE/Environment/Parser (... compiler, interpreter ...) that would go through the code and analyze it? 

The analysis that I am thinking about is debugging, code interpretation, intellisense...  

I know there are some extensions for VS that allow Java Script parsing, but what are your experiences and advices for the best setup?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you need free one. You can use NetBeans. It can handle pretty well with JavaScript, so it should with WebGL.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
For debugging WebGL I recommend WebGL Inspector Chrome extension (http://benvanik.github.io/WebGL-Inspector/). It allows you to log all the WebGL calls, see the current state of GL, look at all the buffers (including vertex buffer visualization), shaders, textures, etc. I found it helpful identifying problems with my WebGL code countless times.

For debugging Javascript, you can either go for a full IDE (WebStorm, VS) and use their debugger, or just let Chrome Devtools handle it. I prefer the latter option, because it feels a bit snappier and more 'solid' for me.

Also, Visual Studio Code (their new little IDE based on Atom) has some very nice Javascript Intellisense and includes a debugger. Might be a good idea to check it out.

There is no mechanism within Eclipse to permanently and physically uninstall a feature and its plug-ins. The process to physically and permanently remove an undesirable feature and its plug-ins is a manual process that should be done when Eclipse is not running. In order to do, you will have to manually remove the files there associated with the feature from the eclipse/features directory and its plug-ins from the eclipse/plugins directory.

Title: Inferring opening/closing parens?
Description: 
    
    
                    
It seems like someone must have done work on figuring out how to infer or suggest where to put closing parentheses.  I mean, highlighting matching parens is great, but suggesting would be even better.  Is this a defined problem?  If so, what is its name (like, what should I Google Scholar?).  If not, why not?  Is it an obviously impossible/poorly posed question?

To wit, let's say I have some malformed, ruby code:

foo.all.map { |i| i.bar }).uniq.compact.reject { |j| j.match /baz/i }


Note that I'm missing the initial parenthesis.  The problem I'm talking about is, "How do I suggest the insertion of a paren at the beginning when I move my cursor over the unpaired paren?"

If this is not a poorly posed question, why hasn't someone done this yet?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
One could keep track of "balanced" vs "unbalanced" parens as the user types. Then suggest a paren as soon as the parens become unbalanced.

For example typing (something)) would suggest an opening paren before s. Correctly placing the "fix-it" paren might be challenging. For example if the user types something(else)) there's a choice: insert the fix-it opening paren after g or at the beginning of the string?

Keeping track of balanced parens would be relatively simple:

int parenCount = 0

event keyUp(char c){
    if(c is close-paren){
        parenCount--;
    }else if(c is open-paren){
        parenCount++;
    }
    if(parenCount &lt; 0){
        // missing an open-paren somewhere
    }
}

// handle missing close-parens when user finished typing the string...
// for example if user types "myObject.something(" and hits enter


Might also need to look for unnecessary parens as in a.doSomethingWith((aNumber))

I have a problem with the @SuppressWarnings annotation when handling raw-types warnings in Eclipse Helios.

According to this post and the docs, the annotation parameter rawtypes should be used instead of the old unchecked in Eclipse Helios. However, when I use the rawtypes annotation, I get following warning:

Unhandled warning token rawtypes


Even when performing a quick-fix over a raw type, Eclipse suggests me to use rawtypes. However, I have found out that the old unchecked parameter still works in my version of Helios while rawtypes doesn't, which doesn't conform to the docs. 

So basically I have already "solved" this issue but the real question is why rawtypes doesn't work?

In Visual Studio 2008 and 2010, you can right click in your .cpp file and choose Go To Header File ... that will take you in one direction. For the other direction, if you right click something you're declaring in the header, and choose Go To Definition, that will take you in the other direction. You might have to go through an ambiguity resolution dialog if you choose the constructor, because the function name matches the class name, but if you choose anything else, you'll go straight where you want. I know this is a two-click approach, rather than one keystroke, but it does do what you want.

I don't see this answer here, but at least in Visual Studio 2012 (Express included!), you can just assign your own keyboard command to go to the header file (NOTE: Only goes one way -- you can't go back to the source file unfortunately...)


Go to Tools/Options/Environment/Keyboard.
Find the following command: EditorContextMenus.CodeWindow.GoToHeaderFile
Assign whatever key combination you want (Alt-S works)
Profit

Title: How to configure Hibernate Tools HQL editor in Eclipse with a custom NamingStrategy
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've installed Hibernate Tools 3.2.4.GA in Eclipse Ganymede.  The main driver for installing it was to be able to issue HQL queries interactively.  

I have configured all of our mapping files, hibernate.properties, etc. and it shows all of our entities and mappings and is able to read a list of tables from the database.  It doesn't appear to use the custom naming strategy I specified in the configuration and therefore I can't query anything.  The query in the Dynamic SQL Preview is correct except for table names.

The way I configured the naming strategy was to right click the hibernate configuration and select 'edit configuration'  In the 'Options' tab I 'browse' for a Naming strategy.  Eclipse is able to find the naming strategy and auto-complete it for me, which would indicate it is in the classpath.  I then hit OK and still have problems.

Am I missing something in the naming strategy configuration for hibernate tools (now jboss tools it would appear) or is it broken?

Optionally, is there another tool that I could use (in or out of eclipse) to issue HQL statements against my database and be able to see the results?

UPDATE
The problem was in the NamingStrategy implementation.  It prepends a string to the front of every table, and changes camel case to all lower case with underscores.  Unfortunately, in the implementation, the string is injected via spring, and there is no default set.  That spring injection wasn't happening in hibernate tools, and because there was no default, the string was empty.  It has been changed to have a default ( which matches our current spring configuration ) and it is working now.

Netbeans 8 is doing crazy auto horizontal scroll, how to disable this!
When coding a long lines, netbeans automatically move horizontally and focus to your mouse pointer.

To replicate :
1. Do a long code, make sure you will have horizontal scroll visible.Sample :

2. Edit above code type="text" to hidden, you will notice that the netbeans will move your view automatically and focus to the mouse cursor!

Note : Even using "Line Wrap" to anywhere, you will see this movement! this make my head break, probably same with you!!? LOL hope someone knows how to disable this.

SOLVED * PROBLEM: In NetBeans
Title: Will any ide warn me when I set &ldquo;Optional&lt;String&gt; optional = null;&rdquo;
Description: 
    
    
                    
If I write something like this

java.util.Optional&lt;String&gt; optional = null;


or as a field (without init value, also not in constructors)

private Optional&lt;String&gt; optional;


or later in the code

optional = null;


I think I should get at least a warning. We had some unexpected NullpointerExceptions which were found very late because nobody expected the possibility to have a null-instance of an Optional (which was obviously a bug).

I tried Eclipse and IntelliJ and both didn't mention it. I also didn't found a plugin. Is there a reason why there isn't such a check? Or is it implemented somewhere?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In Eclipse, you can go to your project properties and then to Java Compiler --code/codecode/codecode/codecode/codecode/code/ppimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mlK2S.png" alt="Eclipse Errors/Warning --&gt; Potential programming problems"/p/div
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you want to see the warning for statement which may cause NullPointer exception in eclipse use findbug plugin for eclipse

From FindBugs Bug Descriptions


  NP: Possible null pointer dereference (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH)
  There is a branch of statement that, if executed, guarantees that a null value will be dereferenced, which would generate a NullPointerException when the code is executed. Of course, the problem might be that the branch or statement is infeasible and that the null pointer exception can't ever be executed; deciding that is beyond the ability of FindBugs.

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
public final class Optional&lt;T&gt; {
....
}


As Optional is a class that inherits from Object (like every class in Java) it can be set to null. There is nothing wrong here.  

But you should always be aware to set it to Optional.empty(), when you want to set it to an empty value.

I used  to use gcc compiler on my unix machine. I am now forced to work on a windows machine. Is there any cool IDE or a simple editor for C with a unix terminal like feel (Black Screen and colored syntax on it :))

What other editors/IDE are as robust as gcc for windows? Also what is your personal favorite. I would like a try a few of the those before I stick with one.

Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you are used to a Unix-y feel and are looking for a text editor, I'd honestly avoid installing Visual Studio. It's a nice IDE, but it is very heavyweight and perhaps much more than you are asking for. That said, you might of course find that you like it, but be aware that you are potentially looking at a several-hundred-megabytes download, 2 gigs for the full package IIRC.

Netbeans is good too, but fairly heavy, and a little difficult to get set up correctly with C and C++, at least last time I tried. It's a good alternative to VS, though.

I'd go for a more lightweight solution, like Notepad++, vim for Windows, or my personal favourite, Geany - http://www.geany.org/

Getting the black background &amp; colored syntax is possible on basically any advanced text editor/IDE nowadays.

As for the compiler, MinGW is probably your best bet. Or you could nick the compiler &amp; toolset that comes with Visual Studio Express :)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Visual Studio.  You can change the fonts &amp; colors however you want.  I have been using the same coloring scheme since Borland Turbo C++ back in the 80's -- yellow text on a dark blue background.

Cygwin is your friend. It gives you all the nice unixy stuff that you miss! :)

In terms of cool IDEs that will integrate nicely with gcc on Cygwin, you should try Netbeans, Eclipse (with CDT) - both require a decent JVM. If you do get Cygwin installed, there's xemacs and gvim I believe that you can get for it...

IMHO stick with Netbeans...

mingw is Minimum Gnu for Windows.  There are several add on packages to it, but it has gcc and g++.  Occasionally there is an issue with some tool not acting exactly right with executables having .exe on their end or / and \\ in output statements, but it's pretty decent.  I can't remember, but I think that there may be some reason that you can't run gdb in Windows, but I could be wrong.

You can also get versions of most of the *nix text editors for Windows.  gVim is available if you like vi or vim.  Versions of vi and vim for the command line are also available, but don't always act right with resized windows.  gVim and vim can do syntax highlighting if you tell them to in the configuration file.

The last couple of versions of Windows have had (or been able to freely download and install) PowerShell, which I suggest you get.  It is different from a *nix shell in many many ways, but often (not always) you can get away with using it just like a *nix shell.  If you use pipes in it you should know that it likes to turn everything into utf-16, though.  The main good thing I've found when using it as a better DOS window is that you can resize the window more freely.  You can still use old DOS windows, though.

Another alternative is cygwin, which besides just the command line tools, presents more of a *nix environment for your programs.  It includes libraries that make things look more like you are running on Linux from your programs' point of view (simulating many Linux system calls, for instance).  I used this a long time ago, but it had some pretty severe problems back then.  I have heard great things about it since then, but I have not had enough of a reason to try it out again.

Visual Studio will be your best bet. Others have mentioned the free Express version which will probably be sufficient for your needs. Visual Studio is not only an IDE, it has Microsoft's compiler bundled with it. Since the choice of IDEs is vast, I'll leave it to you to choose the one you'll be comfortable with.

The venerable GNU gcc compiler is also available on Windows using Cygwin or MinGW. 

If you want something pretty cutting edge, compiler wise, you should check out clang. For various reasons, this is the C compiler to keep your eyes on. It's relatively new and was built with IDE support in mind.

If you have Visual Studio, which I feel is an excellent IDE, you can try to set it up to use GCC/G++.  I've done this before, back in the Visual Studio 6 days.  As long as you aren't using any Windows-specific libraries and write portable C++, you can compile and test on Windows, then periodically ensure that the code also compiles properly for Linux.

Another approach, one that I actually prefer, is to host your source and make files on the Linux box, share the files through Samba, then use your Windows IDE/text editor to edit those files.  Then, you can do the compiling through an SSH terminal.  Sure, you'd lose the convenience of being able to compile through your IDE, but at least you wouldn't have to muck around getting the compiler set up on Windows.

The vast majority of developers I interact with are using Eclipse (I prefer NetBeans) and will leverage many of the free plugins that are available. However, many of them are using few if any tools that require monetary payment.

Have developers ever considered that this may be unwise and that they are compromising their own productivity? Are there certain types of tools that the majority of developers will pay for? Likewise, are there tools they would like to use but aren't because they aren't free?

Intellij is probably the most popular 'paid-for' tool that I know developers use. I've worked at client sites where they regard it as so productive that they have site-wide licenses, whereas some similar sites will use (the free) Eclipse or NetBeans.

There's a huge motivation not to pay for stuff. But if doesn't have to save you that much time to be worthwhile. The per-seat/per-day developer cost in large enterprises is surprisingly high. If you claim that Intellij saves you, say, 2-3 days productivity in a man-year, then it'll have paid for itself (this is largely a subjective argument, I would say, but I know independent consultants who pay for Intellij themselves).

We have been using Jira + Fisheye + Crucible.  While the first two are just your standard tools for tracking issues and viewing/searching the repository, the third tool Crucible has been invaluable.  It is a tool to help with code reviews.

http://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/

It has increased the amount of code reviews we do dramatically as well as giving us some tracking that bugs got fixed and the code was reviewed.

In addition, we have some floating licenses for YourKit
http://www.yourkit.com/

That we use quite frequently to sort out memory and performance issues.

We try to follow the mantra:
First, write it so it works.
Second, optimize only what needs optimization.

In order to optimize, you need to know where the bottle necks are, and profiling is one of the best ways to find out.  You pick the slowest thing and fix it, profile again, if it's fast enough you are done.  If not, pick the slowest thing and fix it, rinse and repeat.

Title: Add two numbers instead of combining
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am trying to create a program in which a user can enter 2 numbers and the program will take the 2 numbers and multiply them to get an answer. However, for this specific example, I am simply trying to take 2 numbers from a user and I want Java to add them. eg 1+1=2, instead of 1+1=11. 

My code:

import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class MultiplicationTables {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        //declare variables

        String num1;
        String num2;
        int ans=0;

        num1=JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,"Enter a number");
        num2=JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,"Enter another number");

        ans=Integer.parseInt(num1);
        ans=Integer.parseInt(num2);


        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Your answer is " + (num1+num2));
    }
}

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You are using num1 and num2 which are Strings instead of ans which should be your sum as an int.
Also you don't add correctly the 2 values into ans.

public static void main(String args[]){
    String num1 = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,"Enter a number");
    String num2 = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,"Enter another number");

    int ans = Integer.parseInt(num1);
    ans += Integer.parseInt(num2);

    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Your answer is " + ans);
}

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
num1 and num2 are String. 
So as you write num1+num2 you get the result of their concatenation.

In fact, you don't use the Integer.parseInt(); results.

Instead, do it to addition two int values:

int result = Integer.parseInt(num1) + Integer.parseInt(num2);


And display result :

JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Your answer is " + result);

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Here: 

num1=JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,"Enter a number");
num2=JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,"Enter another number");


The option pane returns strings, what you seem to understand, as you then go:

ans=Integer.parseInt(num1);
ans=Integer.parseInt(num2);


But then you use the + operator on your string results:

... +(num1+num2));


But + for strings concatenates them. 

So instead of "adding" strings, you want to add the numbers, as in:

int1FromUser = Integer.parseInt(num1);
int2FromUser = Integer.parseInt(num2);

int sum = int1FromUser + int2FromUser;


That is all there is to this.

( and I took the freedom to use slightly better naming - keep in mind to use variable names that say something about the meaning of the thing they point to )
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
You are doing it wrong. You are adding Strings in the end and ignoring the parsed Integers. 

And also you using the same integer variable for both inputs.

So that should be 

int ans1=0;
int ans2=0;

...

 ans1=Integer.parseInt(num1);
 ans2=Integer.parseInt(num2);


And in the end 

JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Your answer is " +(ans1+ans2));

    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
+ is used in addition when using Integer or int, and it also used to  concatenate two Strings. In your case num1 and num2 are Strings, and hence it is concatenating the result. So you will have to change your code to reflect following changes:

ans = Integer.parseInt(num1);
ans += Integer.parseInt(num2); // add the result of parseInt to ans
//--^---------------------------
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Your answer is " + ans ); // another one


Or alternatively:

JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Your answer is " + (Integer.parseInt(num1) + Integer.parseInt(num2)));

    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I'd suggest you change the last line of your method to: 

JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Your answer is " + (Integer.parseInt(num1) + Integer.parseInt(num2)));


This way, you don't need the "ans" variable (which in your code doesn't really do anything) at all. Instead, you can simply parse the int values and add them on the same line as you're writing the message. 

If you want to use ans, try this: 

ans = Integer.parseInt(num1) + Integer.parseInt(num2);


Then:

JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Your answer is " + ans);

    
    
Title: Favourite Features of VS 2010
Description: 
    
    
                    
With the general public release of Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 today, this latest version has created a lot of hype and interest.

Indeed, the opinion I've gauged is that VS 2010 has resolved a great deal of the minor flaws left over from previous versions, as well as added some particularly useful new code editor and project development tools (in particular the Premium/Ultimate versions).

My question here is: what are you favourite new features in VS 2010 that have really got you excited? Or similarly, what are the flaws of VS 2008 that you are most glad to have resolved?

There is a wealth of changes in VS 2010, of course, but these are some of the ones that have interested me most (about which I know!).


Integrated support for F# (with multi-targeting for .NET 2.0 - 4.0)/
Much improved WPF designer. The VS 2008 was more than a bit buggy at times.
Great improvements to the code editor, such as call hierarchy viewing.
A decent add-in framework.
A greatly expanded testing framework (now capable of database testing, for example) in Premium/Ultimate.
Project planning and modelling features in Premium/Ultimate.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm from a Java school, but I'd like to get my hands dirty in C/C++ development as well. Can you suggest:


a Lightweight beginner IDE [Eg: JCreator for Java] (Simple and small download)
a full-blown advanced IDE [Eg: Eclipse for Java] (Every feature and huge download)
should I use GCC or other compilers? 


Thanks a lot guys!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

  1) a Lightweight beginner IDE [Eg: JCreator for Java] (Simple and small download) 


Eclipse with CDT (~40 MB download) or Visual Studio 2008 Express edition (2.6 MB download for installer and then tons of stuff that it'll pull from the net) -- it's free. Also, get the SP1. But, I still suggest that you take a look at Visual Studio.


  2) a full-blown advanced IDE [Eg: Eclipse for Java] (Every feature and huge download) 


Eclipse with CDT (~40 MB download) or Visual Studio 2008 Professional (if you are going to pay).


  3) should I use GCC or other compilers?


Yes and no. Depends on your needs. GNU g++ is great to get started with. However, hooking up with CDT may prove to be difficult. 

If you intend to do professional Windows programming in near future, it is best to buy the Visual Studio 2008 Pro (and install SP1) and get used to it.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you have to do it in Vista and if it is Microsoft platform-specific, then there is no better full-blown IDE than Visual Studio. You can download Visual Studio Express Edition for C++ development as a lighter IDE (Not that light though but it is free). Eclipse with GCC works great as well if you want to go cross-platform.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I suggest Code::Blocks. Remember to download the codeblocks-8.02mingw-setup.exe, it includes the GCC compiler and GDB debugger. With it you're ready to start :)
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I agree that there is no better Windows IDE for C++ development than Visual Studio. Apart from the free Visual Studio Express, you might also want to consider Visual Studio Standard. It costs about $200 in the US and, among other advantages, allows you to use third-party plugins such as Visual Assist. Those will help you speed up your development even further. 
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
For really light weight, you can go without any IDE. Grab Cygwin, install GCC and start writing code in any text editor (E.g. Crimson Editor). In fact, I suggest you try this to get an idea of how C++ programs are actually compiled behind the scene of an IDE.

You can get Visual Studio Express C++, which is a good package for a beginner. Probably easiest to get started with this.

You can get Eclipse with CDT and use the Cygwin GCC tools, but this is inferior to Visual Studio in certain ways.

Then there's CodeBlock, which I've heard good things about, but don't know how it compares to Visual Studio or Eclipse/CDT.

Do you want to just learn C++ or use C++ to interact with Vista components?  The title of your question says Vista but your description is asking which IDE to use.  

I agree using Visual Studio C++ Express is a great place to start.  It will basically give you the foundation for writing Windows Apps with C++.  You said you're from the JAVA world and if you have experience with C# or VB.NET, don't expect all the designers and wizards to be here in C++.  Anyone who had done C++ GUI work knows that this isn't always the case.  Not to discourage you, there are designers, just not for everything.

If you want to learn how to interact with Windows through C++, the VC++ main site is here, and the how-do-i videos here, also download the feature pack if you haven't installed SP1 yet is here, besides ribbonizing MFC, they've included Boost in the STL, which is awesome.  And finally, the guided tours are here.

Also, you don't technically need MFC to write GUI applications, you can call Win32 API functions directly, but MFC is a foundation and will help.

That should get your started.  If you need more help, just post a comment.

I agree with the posters above. For microsoft platform specific development, the Visual Studio environment is by far the best. The express editions are nice, but if I remember correctly, they do't come with the win32 SDK, so you still can't make windows GUI programs with it (officially)... 

If all you want is to learn C++, gcc/g++ is a great free compiler and an editor with syntax highlighting should be enough. I find an IDE only adds value for larger projects, for simple test/learning projects and IDE is not that neccessary.

You mentioned that that you know about Eclipse for Java. If you have any experience with Eclipse for Java then you can leverage most of that experience towards your C/C++ development by using Eclipse's CDT ( C/C++ Development Toolkit ) plugin.

I strongly encourage using Eclipse with CDT over using Visual Studio because any time spent learning Visual Studio will be lost if you ever want to do any Linux development.

... 

I forgot to mention that Eclipse with CDT has all the important features that full version VS has ( and probably more ) ... but doesn't cost any money.

I am rather partial to the Code Gear (formerly Borland) C++ compiler line which I have been using for years.
They have recently release a free 'community' addition called Turbo Explorer

Netbeans is also very good IDE with many futures in it.
