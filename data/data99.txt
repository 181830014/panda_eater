Title: Not able to Find Locate the Element through xpath using Selenium IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
Xpath i am getting is - id('submitButtonWrapper')/x:input for 'Login button'on application but not able to target the field.

URL of the application - https://authentication.liveperson.net/
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Try with the Following Xpath Expression:

Driver.findElement(By.xpath(".//*[@id='submitButtonWrapper']/input")).click();

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can find this by using the Record button in Selenium IDE.
In case you prefer to do it manually, here is what you should enter:

Command: Click
Target: name=loginButton
Value:

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Here is the solution of your problem, It will work with clickAt command. So in this way change your code -

Command: clickAt
Target: name=loginButton
Value:


the command specification says -


  clickAt(locator, coordString)
      Arguments:
  
  
  locator - an element locator
  coordString - specifies the x,y position (i.e. - 10,20) of the mouse event relative to the element returned by the locator.
  
  Clicks on a link, button, checkbox or radio button. If the click action causes a new page to load (like a link usually does), call
  waitForPageToLoad.
  


I'm not much clear with this command but i was able to selecting items from chozen dropdowns only with clickAt but not with click command

  I'm required to install either JRE or JDK, does JDK have any benefits over JRE in this case? since I'm not gonna write in Java at all, only C/C++


Looks like installing JRE is sufficient. Any of the C/C++ code features won't rely on a JDK. So as long you're not developing Java code the JDK isn't needed.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
As the name says, the JDK is the development kit for Java.

When installing Eclipse only for C/C++ development, installing the JRE should thus be sufficient. 

You only need a JVM capable of running eclipse in; and a JRE will do just fine.
    
    
Title: Codename one ActionListener build process not working
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am building my first app with codename one.
However I think that there is a bug during build when using eclipse and the new GUI Builder.
I'm on eclipse neon and just installed the cn1 plugin this week.

1) The main thing which causes actionListeners not to work is that there is a line missing inside the EventCallbackClass

public void actionPerformed(com.codename1.ui.events.ActionEvent ev) {
            com.codename1.ui.Component sourceComponent = ev.getComponent();
            if(sourceComponent.getParent().getLeadParent() != null) {
                sourceComponent = sourceComponent.getParent().getLeadParent();
            }

            if(sourceComponent == gui_createAccount) {
             --------------missing------------------
            }
}


The oncreateAccountActionEvent-method should be invoked in there, but it is not in the generated code.

It probaly is caused because I get an error during build

2) I get this error when clicking the "Action Event" within the "Property Sheet" -/pprecode/code/prep/pprecode/code/prep/ppstrong/strong/pp/pprecode/code/pre/div

does someone know how I enable the compile warnings in netbeans 8.2 and cygwin compiler (for c++)?

For example when I write

I dont get a "signed/unsigned-comparison-warning".

I dont find anything in the settings. The compile-command in the box at the bottem is

g++    -c -g -MMD -MP -MF "build/Debug/Cygwin-Windows/main.o.d" -o build/Debug/Cygwin-Windows/main.o main.cpp


I guess there should be the paramter "-w" for warnings..

can someone help?

You should go to File/Project Properties then select Build/C++ Compiler. You can then set the warning levels there. See the screenshot: 



If the Warning Level doesn't do it, then just add -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Weffc++ to Compilation Line/Additional Options in the same dialog window.
    
    
Title: PhpStorm does not detect my PHP 7 remote interpreter
Description: 
    
    
                    
So I'm using PhpStorm 2016.1.1 and I've been using a PHP 5.6 remote interpreter since I've started using this IDE.

The "remote" refers to a web dev server I have on my personal network.

So before my issue, I had the following the configuration:



As you can see, PhpStorm detects my PHP 5.6 version properly.

A few months ago, I switched to PHP 7 on my server so last week, I thought I would switch the interpreter too. So my PHP 7 interpreter is /usr/bin/php or /usr/bin/php7.0

The problem I'm facing is that none of those two works, PhpStorm keeps giving me the error:


  PHP version: Not installed




I already double checked the permissions and both PHP 5.6 and 7 executables have the exact same permissions. I also tried making a copy of the PHP 7 executable and chmod it to 777 but didn't help.

Also calling PHP from the console with the same user as the one in my remote configuration works perfectly:

user@webdev:/var/www$ php -v

I tried to use the Invalidate Caches / Restart of PhpStorm but didn't help.

Now I'm running out of ideas so I'm wondering if someone here has a clue of what's going on here.

Problem is that there is unicode characters in my PHP config for some reasons:



Thus, that breaks the XML generated by the PHPStorm phpinfo.php file.

I haven't found a way to get rid of those unicode characters yet so I ended up hacking temporarily (you know that temp hack probably means I'll keep it like this forever right ? ^^) the /home/&lt;user&gt;/.phpstorm_helpers/phpinfo.php by replacing line 154:

"name" =&gt; htmlspecialchars($configurationOptionName)


With:

Title: Atom IDE - Keybinding
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have disabled the default Atom IDE keybinding for the combination alt + f (In my keymap.cson):

How to make it to show [ character when I click alt + f?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Here's how to do this, based on this forum entry:


Open the editor's init.coffee script file (Menu: Atom &gt; Init Script...)
Insert the following text (make sure to use the right indentation:

atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor',
  'custom:insert-bracket': -&gt;
    atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()?.insertText('[')

Save the file.
Open the keybinding file (Menu: Atom &gt; Keymap...)
Add the following mapping (replacing yours) to call the new command:

'atom-text-editor':
  'alt-f': 'custom:insert-bracket'

Save the file.
As a last step, restart Atom.


This worked for me, pressing Alt+f now inserts an opening bracket (which is automatically completed with a closing bracket by Atom).
    
    
Title: How to use templates defined in other package without adding source file to the project?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've created a package which contains several templates (TFrame descendants).
These templates has been added to the palette.
In other packages, I'm trying to use these templates but each time I add one of them, a message appear:


  The following unit: %s, is needed in your project to create the
  template. Do you wish to add it?


mrYes: 

Source file is added to the project. 
Furthermore, it causes the following error on compiling: 


  E2200 Package '%s' already contains unit '%s'




mrNo: 

It's ok, but the question is asked each time I place one of my
   templates. Me and my collegues will use these templates alot of times and I really would like to avoid that message.



Update 1:

Here are steps to observe the described behavior:


Create a package project named Package1.
Add a TFrame descendant named MyTest.
Add TMyTest to palette (Structure window, right click, add to
palette).
Set project output directories to .\out
Build the project.
Add \out to library path.
In the same projectgroup, create a package project named Package2.
Add Package1, to "requires" (in Package2.dpk).
Add a form.
Add a TMyTestTemplate to the form.


Update 2:

I'm looking for a solution which works with Delphi 2007 and Delphi XE7.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
A bit more work but one that should fit your needs:  


Create Package FooRuntime(Mark RuntimeOnly), add your TMyFrame  
Create Package FooDesignTime(Mark DesigntimeOnly), requires FooRuntime, Registers your frame  
Install FooDesignTime  
Link your other project to FooRuntime  


Without the packages the IDE seems to fail to recognize the units.
    
    
Title: Why did all my folder dates suddenly change?
Description: 
    
    
                    
This morning I started the Delphi Seattle (Update 1) IDE into a project group 'X' I was working on yesterday (automatically, autosave options are on). I then immediately switched to another project group 'Y', I was (of course) not asked if I wanted to save changes.

Now the folder dates of all the projects in group X have changed to that time (9:25, Total Commander screenshot):



I just confirmed this behaviour by switching back and forth again.

Note that not all dates change. When there is no project in one of these folders, the date remains unchanged. But when a project resides in a subfolder (in this example ClientDataset\NestedClientDatasets), that subfolder date changes too.

What is going on here? Is this a bug?
I consider it unwanted behaviour.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The folder modified date that is reported is, as I understand it, the latest modified date of the objects in that folder. So look inside one of those folders to find out which file or files have that modified date. That will indicate which aspect of the IDE is responsible. Whether or not you can change the behaviour remains to be seen and will depend on which file it is that has been changed. 

Personally I would not be surprised if the history tracking (the __history folders) was responsible. If that is the case then you can disable history tracking for instance by using Andy Hausladen's tools.

when I hover over hello function the text appear on hovering, function() : void
so how IDE determines that what is return type of function although its js file not ts file still it showing return and data type, how this happens, what is this thing that causes it
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The thing is called IntelliSense

Well, I am assuming that the team behind Visual Studio does some analysis on the javascript code that you write. In the case of your method, it's easy to see the return type should be void. Maybe it can do more complex analysis as well, you could find out by returning a method returning an integer (statically) or even an object. This is part of what they call IntelliSense in Visual Studio. 

Javascript also has some type knowledge

Even when you are programming using javascript instead of typescript, you can still determine what Type a variable is. Typescript gives this an explicit mention, e.g: let name : String = "JD";. But even in plain Javascript you are dealing with types, even when you do not give them an explicit mention. You can test this with, for example, the following code.

 var name = "JD";
 console.log(typeof name); // logs "string"


I think that explaining exactly how IntelliSense does this would be beyond the scope of this answer and I fear that I will not be able to give an adequate answer either. Though there are a few posts on stackoverflow which aim to answer this, or seem to link to further resources anyway.

In last project, I used python 2.7. The new one have to run in python 3.5 so I installed 3.5. I choose Python 3.5 in Setting--code/code/pprecode/code/prep/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
It's probably because the pip command points to python2.7 version of pip, and as django is already installed for python 2.7, you are getting the message you mentioned.

You need to install django for python3.5. To do that, either directly run pip executable inside python3.5 folder, or choose python3.5 as the interpreter from pycharm, and install django through the ui of pycharm.

Depending on how you installed python3.5, you could also run 

pip3.5 install django


from the console to invoke python3.5 version of pip
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Just go with pip3 suited for Python 3x envs:

   pip3 install Django

I started to use Android Studio and I am looking for the option to fix errors similar to Eclipse IDE. 

For example, in Eclipse, if you have some code that might throw an exception Eclipse shows you an option to surround the code with a try/catch statement, so you don't have to write it manually.

In Android Studio I can't find this option and it's very frustating for me because in Eclipse it was so fast to do this and here I have to do it manually.

Anybody knows how to do this in Android Studio?

Is there a way to configure IntelliJ IDEA so that when you transpile code from TypeScript to Javascript, it ignores the Javascript files in search results and most importantly omit them in Find Usages results?

In doing so, however, it would also be important to keep JS results that are NOT transpiled from TypeScript (ie: the ones originally written in JS, not TS).

Where each section @@ -n1,n2 +n3,n4 @@ means that previously (n1,n2) the lines n1 to n1+n2 are now lines n3 to n3+n4. 

This means that 


if n2 is zero then its all addition (Use n3 to n3 + n4 to highlight)
Else if n4 is zero then its all deletion (Use n3 to higlight)
Else its modification (Use n3 to highlight)

    
    
Title: Light Table read input
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm having some trouble to get started with Light Table.

Here's my code (Clojure)

(ns prova1-ed.core
  (:gen-class))

(use 'clojure.java.io)

(defn -main [&amp; args]

  (println "Type the name of the file to read: ")

  (let [fileName (read-line)]
    (let [rdr (reader fileName)]
      (doseq [line (line-seq rdr)]
        (println line)
  )))
)


I'm sure it works. I've tested with lein run. As you can see, the program should read a file which the name is given by the user.

I've tried CTRL+SPACE in Light Table, but this is what I receive:

ERROR: Unhandled REPL handler exception processing message {:data {:auto? false, :pos {:line 14, :ch 1}, :mime "text/x-clojure", :tags [:editor.clj :editor.clojure], :type-name "Clojure", :line-ending "\r\n", :ns user, :path "C:\\Users\\Tiago\\Documents\\Clojure\\prova1_ed\\src\\prova1_ed\\core.clj", :print-length nil, :name "core.clj", :local true, :code "(ns prova1-ed.core\n  (:gen-class))\n\n(use 'clojure.java.io)\n\n(defn -main [&amp; args]\n\n  (println \"Type the name of the file to read: \")\n\n  (let [fileName (read-line)]\n    (let [rdr (reader fileName)]\n      (doseq [line (line-seq rdr)]\n        (println line)\n  )))\n)\n"}, :id 90, :op editor.eval.clj.sonar, :session 65d1da68-a730-4ffe-9365-9527726384e3}




How can i run it in the Light Tables' enviroment, so that I can input the file name?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
TLDR

I don't think you can run (read-line) in Light Table as it'd have to add explicit support for allowing input. There's no standard input basically.

An Alternative

I'd suggest you modify your -main function to accept an explicit file-name argument instead of trying to read it from a standard input that isn't available.

I've got a Clojure webapp that I work on in Light Table.

I've got a -main function in a namespace named my-app.web. It looks something like this:

(defn -main [&amp; [port]]
  (let [port (Integer. (or port (env :port) 5000))
        store (cookie/cookie-store {:key (env :session-secret)})]
    (jetty/run-jetty (-&gt; #'secured-app
                         wrap-with-logging
                         wrap-current-user
                         wrap-current-auth
                         wrap-error-page
                         (site {:session {:store store}}))
                     {:port port :join? false})))


In a separate file I've named light-table-start.clj, I've got the following code to run my app inside Light Table:

(require '[my-app.web :as web])
(require '[ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty])

(defonce server (web/-main "5000"))

;; (.start server)
;; (.stop server)


I run the Eval: Eval editor contents command (Ctrl+Shift+Enter on Windows and Linux or ⌘+Shift+Enter on Mac OS) the first time I want to run my app (or later, if the connection is closed for some reason). When I want to start or stop the server I can just highlight the code on the respective commented lines and run the Eval: Eval a form in editor command (Ctrl+Enter on Windows and Linux or ⌘+Enter on Mac OS).

Just use Eclipse.

Since Eclipse is self-contained (doesn't require installation on the host machine), you can just start it up and go. It's also pretty lightweight considering you're probably using at least an 8GB flash drive.

Also, you could just use Eclipse to create a new workspace on the flash drive by going to

File &gt; Switch Workspace &gt; Other...


Then just set it to a folder on your flash drive. Then you can just open the workspace when Eclipse starts up on whatever machine you're using.

I've followed these instructions to install Cassandra: http://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/install/installDeb_t.html 
When I do $ cqlsh terminal replies me with 

Connection error: Could not connect to localhost:9160 


I read that the issue might be with configuration file cassandra.yaml
However, I turned out I can't access it. My etc/cassandra folder is empty: enter image description here
How to access cassandra.yaml?
Where is cassandra is stored in my project? 
Is there a way to check if Cassandra is actually set up in project?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The image you have attached is showing the ~/.cassandra directory off of your home dir.  That's not the same as/etc/cassandra.  You should be able to confirm this with the following command:

$ ls -al /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml
-rw-r--r-- 1 cassandra cassandra 43985 Mar 11 12:46 /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml


To verify if Cassandra is even running, this should work for you if you have successfully completed the packaged install:

$ sudo service cassandra status


Otherwise, simply running this should work, too:

$ ps -ef | grep cassandra


When you set up Cassandra, you'll want to set the listen_address and rpc_address to the machine's hostname or IP.  They're set to localhost by default, so if it's running cqlsh should connect to that automatically.

My guess is that Cassandra is not starting for you.  Check the system.log file, which (for the packaged install) is stored in /var/logs/cassandra:

$ cat /var/log/cassandra/system.log


Check out that file, and you might find some clues as to what is happening here.

Also, did you really install Cassandra 2.0?  That version has been deprecated, so for a new install you shouldn't go any lower than Cassandra 2.1.
    
    
Title: TDD, Resharper, Visual Studio 2015, are not multi projects friendly
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a C# solution with a project for my unit test (and several production logic projects). Every time I write a test first, I'd like the generated code to go to the right project.

For instance if I have a project named "BusinessLogicA" (assembly and namespace names alike) and I add a refernece to it in my unit test project, that inside some test class I have the following code.

using ThisNameSpaceExist = BusinessLogicA;
....

var instanceOfAlreadyExistingClass = new ThisNameSpaceExist.AlreadyExistingClass();
var instanceOfNewClass = new ThisNameSpaceExist.NewClass();


Where AlreadyExistingClass exists and NewClass doesn't, then whenever/however I try to autogenerate NewClass, it gets created inside the UnitTest project.

namespace UnitTest.BusinessLogicA {
    class NewClass {


It's important to note, all projects are withing the same solution and I reference the project (not the built dll), so everything should be set to have the class created at the right place (inside the right project).

Is there a way to enable/force this behaviour?
If not, any lead on how to deal with it the easiest way?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The problem is, how would Resharper/Visual Studio/RandomTool know where your generated class should go?  Ideally, your unit tests would have a namespace that is similar to the classes they test, such as:

namespace UnitTest.BusinessLogicA
namespace BusinessLogicA


And so be in a spot on disk that maps to these, like:

root\UnitTest\BusinessLogicA
root\BusinessLogicA


But there are hundreds of variations on this that I can think of that the tool would have to be smart enough to handle, or offer some configuration.  I don't think it's an impossible problem, but I don't know of any tool that can do this.

To alleviate this a bit though, I have a "finger macro" for classes that I auto-generate:


Put the cursor on the auto-generated class name (it's there as soon as you ask Resharper to create the class).
Hit Ctrl+Shift+R, R (Open refactor context menu, select "Move to folder")
In the dialog that comes up, remove the test-specific part of the path, which maps to the corresponding business-logic path of my solution.
Accept the dialog.


I can't get it much faster/easier than that, so of course I'd love a plugin that just moves it to the right spot automatically.

It's not quite possible as you describe in your question (each eclipse workbench only supports displaying one perspective), but the following options will give you a similar effect:


Open multiple eclipse windows, each using a different perspective. This isn't a great option though, which leads to...
(Recommended) - avoid perspectives entirely, and just open up all the relevant views, positioning them where you want. 


I use option 2 myself - everything is open at the same time, and since you don't have things shuffling around or disappearing when you switch "perspectives", it's easy to train yourself to remember where specific views are.

Answer 1: 

    
    
I think your problem is with this line:

(setq ecb-layout-name "emcas")


According to the source:

Currently available layouts:
+ Left layouts:   left1 left2 left3 left4 left5 left6 left7 left8 left9 left10 left11 left12   left13 left14 left15
+ Right layouts:   right1
+ Top layouts:   top1 top2
+ Left-right layouts:   leftright1 leftright2 leftright3


So it seems like emcas is not a valid option, which is hinted at in the error message: (error-type: void-function, error-data: (ecb-layout-function-emcas)) note the end is emcas.

It doesn't seem to; the status bar at the bottom of the VS editor keeps you apprised of where you are in the code editor, giving you a line (LN) number, column (Col) number, and a character (I think) number (Ch), such as:



It seems the "Col" and the "Ch" are in lockstop, and that makes sense: each "column" is one character wide. If I'm right, what's the use of showing both? If I'm wrong, when can "Col" and "Ch" differ in value, and why would anyone care? My intuition (even men have it some times, even though it's usually wrong, in my experience) nudges me that this may have something to do with alternative character sets or something...

Hi @pedrofurla you are right. With community edition you will not have feature in your IntelliJ IDEA to create Play Application directly. 

If you wish to create Play application make sure you have downloaded Typesafe Activator. GOTO cmd prompt and then simply run below command,


"activator new"
Select option 6 for Play and Scala App
Give your application name and you are done with it
Now open your IntelliJ IDEA
GOTO File Menu --&gt; Open --&gt; then select your project and checked option "Auto import"
click on "OK".


Once you perform above steps it will download some dependency and will take some time to prepare your app.

Once process complete from your project path execute "activator run" command and open http://localhost:9000 to check everything works fine and test your app.
    
    
Title: Size of splash screen IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
For my thesis work, I need to create an IDE and I want to create a splash screen for the IDE.
So my first question is that I don't know which size for the image I must create for the splash screen.
My second question is that probably a lot of different screen resolutions are available in the market and the screen splash might be bigger or smaller for some computers... Is there anything that we could do to solve this ?

P.S.: I really liked the splash screen from IntelliJ IDE (15), I want to create something like that as a splash screen.

//----------------------------------------------------------------//

Solution for question 2:

    //Get the resolution of the screen PC
    Toolkit toolkit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
    int X = (toolkit.getScreenSize().width);
    int Y = (toolkit.getScreenSize().height);

    //Get the  pixels of the screen middle resolution
    int cX = (toolkit.getScreenSize().width / 2) - ((int)((ImageView) s.lookup("#splash_logo")).getFitWidth())/2;
    int cY = (toolkit.getScreenSize().height / 2) - ((int)((ImageView) s.lookup("#splash_logo")).getFitHeight()/2);

    //Set the position of Stage to middle
    primaryStage.setX(cX);
    primaryStage.setY(cY);

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you want to scale it in relation to the monitor's resolution, I'd first get the height and width with the java.awt.Toolkit:

Toolkit toolkit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
int X = (toolkit.getScreenSize().width)
int Y = (toolkit.getScreenSize().height)


Then you can scale an image that you're using for your splashscreen by using this method:

public BufferedImage scaleImage(int multiplier, BufferedImage img) {

    BufferedImage bi = new BufferedImage(multiplier * img.getWidth(null), multiplier * img.getHeight(null), BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);

    Graphics2D grph = (Graphics2D) bi.getGraphics();
    grph.scale(multiplier, multiplier);

    // everything drawn with grph from now on will get scaled.
    grph.drawImage(img, 0, 0, null);
    grph.dispose();

    return bi;
}


Then center it on the screen by calculating the middle and setting your component there:

    int cX = (toolkit.getScreenSize().width / 2) - (getWidth() / 2);
    int cY = (toolkit.getScreenSize().height / 2) - (getHeight() / 2);
    component.setLocation(cX, cY);


actual implementation is up to you, but these are the tools I use and it works fine for me.  Hope this helps!

Title: NetBeans fails to recognize and/or create folders that start with &#39;.&#39;?
Description: 
    
    
                    
At least in Windows, folders with names starting with '.' (dot) characters are valid, and it's possible to create or name folders starting with a '.' (dot) character by ending the folder's name with a '.' (dot) during creation or rename.

NetBeans (8.0.2 and DEV) seems to fail to recognize such folders, making them unavailable or invisible in the "Projects" or "Files" tabs.

During the creation of such named folders, NetBeans further fails to close the "New Folder" window, after clicking "Finish", although, in the real file-system, the file gets created successfully.

Is this a bug?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Folders starting with . are ignored by NetBeans by default. To change this behavior, go to Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Miscellaneous -&gt; Files and remove .* from the end of the Ignored Files Pattern, thus changing it from:
^(CVS|SCCS|vssver.?\.scc|#.*#|%.*%|_svn)$|~$|^\.(?!(htaccess|git.+|hgignore)$).*$
to...
^(CVS|SCCS|vssver.?\.scc|#.*#|%.*%|_svn)$|~$|^\.(?!(htaccess|git.+|hgignore)$)$



As for the folder-creation problem, yes, this is a bug with the NetBeans IDE.

I submitted the issue (#256500) to the NetBean's bugtracker.
    
    
Title: C++ namespace &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; appearing in the Eclipse parser
Description: 
    
    
                    
Recently I have being working on a project using C++ as the programming language and Eclipse CDT as the programming IDE. The 'Chrono' library is used in the project. 

I was trying to define the "&lt;&lt;" stream operator for different time scales like nanoseconds by putting the definitions in the same namespace as chrono, namely "std::chrono". One small example of the code of the header file (Test.hpp) is illustrated as following:

#include &lt;chrono&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

namespace test{ namespace chrono{
  typedef std::chrono::nanoseconds  nanoseconds;
}}

namespace std{ namespace chrono{
  inline std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; s, nanoseconds dur)
  {
     return s &lt;&lt; dur.count() &lt;&lt; "ns";
  }
}} 


The above code together with other parts of the project can be compiled correctly. However, the IDE, Eclipse CDT, keeps complaining "Type 'std::chrono::nanoseconds' could not be resolved" and the auto-completion functionality says "No Default Proposals" for any member variables/functions in the namespace "std::chrono". It looks like that adding new functions into the "std::chrono" namespace in this header file somehow 'hides' other content from the Eclipse's point of views. 

The question is what could be the reason leading to such 'error' messages in Eclipse CDT or it is one flaw in my programming? I would appreciate any help or hint from you.

I also copy-past the code into Xcode on the laptop and there is no such error message as in Eclipse CDT.

Additional information:

The os I am using is Mac OS, thus the chrono library is slightly different from that mentioned in the answer. The screenshot of 'chrono.hpp' is as following:



Actually, my CDT has no issue to find the members in the namespace 'std::chrono::'. What confuses me is CDT's behaviour when I add/override members in the namespace 'std::chrono::'. See the following pictures:

Errors appear when I override a member function in the namespace:


Errors do not appear when I do nothing on the namespace:


Any idea on how to solve this problem?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Assumptions about your setup

I believe you have changed your build settings to use -std=c++0x or something similar as the chrono library requires it.

Perhaps you did it like this:


At the top of chrono (header file) there is a bit like this:

#if __cplusplus &lt; 201103L
# include &lt;bits/c++0x_warning.h&gt;
#else


so that if you don't have sufficiently new C++ standard, you get a compile error.

Now the problem is the CDT indexer that is used to generate highlighting and code completions does not know you are using __cplusplus &gt;= 201103L. You can see this in this following screenshot that the majority of chrono is inactive because __cplusplus is the wrong value. 

This screenshot shows the incorrect value and the errors CDT identifies:



And if you try and code complete, you get the wrong thing too:



How to fix it

To fix the problem, you need to tell CDT that your project uses GCC settings that are different from the default GCC settings. i.e. because of the different standard __cplusplus in particular has the wrong value.

Title: Android Studio hide incorrect &ldquo;Probable bug&rdquo;
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've written the following equals function in class Finding:

@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!(o instanceof Integer)) {
        return super.equals(o);
    }
    return (o.equals(permanentID) || o.equals(tempID));
}


tempID and permanentID are both Integers. Now when I call finding.equals(5), I get a warning in my inspection:


  'equals()' between objects of inconvertible types 'Integer' and 'Finding' at line 55


I can choose to suppress this for the statement, member or class. But I actually want to suppress it for any call to this equals function. Is there any way to do that?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The warning is a side effect of the fact that your equals method is incorrect.  By the contract of equals on Object (the method you are overriding) it's not possible for an Integer to be equal to your Finding object.

These are the rules for the equals method:


It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value x, x.equals(x)
should return true. 
It is symmetric: for any non-null reference
values x and y, x.equals(y) should return true if and only if
y.equals(x) returns true. 
It is transitive: for any non-null
reference values x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and
y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) should return true
4.It is consistent: for any non-null reference values x and y, multiple
invocations of x.equals(y) consistently return true or consistently
return false, provided no information used in equals comparisons on
the objects is modified
For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false.


You're better off creating a new method to do the comparison above, you're likely to get some strange results if you leave your equals method as it is.

Look for openProjectsDisplayNames and openProjectsURLs in the file config/Preferences/org/netbeans/modules/projectui.properties in the user configuration directory (see http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqWhatIsUserdir )

Delete the ones corresponding to the project you want to avoid opening.

Another option would be to just delete the whole user configuration directory to reset your config. This might be necessary anyway if Netbeans is freezing for another reason.
