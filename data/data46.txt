Title: How to skip parentheses on Netbeans with enter?
Description: 
    
    
                    
So I have been programming in C++ with Eclipse and have the habit of hitting enter to skip parentheses (anyone who has ever used eclipse probably knows what I am talking about).

I have recently started learning Java and decided to use NetBeans, mostly due to the much more simple interface.

However, I would like to know if there a way to skip the (), [], &lt;/pp/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
This should be this option:



From the general Editor features:


  By default, the IDE automatically inserts matching pairs of braces, brackets, and quotes.
  When you type an opening curly brace and then press Enter, the closing brace is added automatically.
  For (, [, ", and ', the editor inserts a matching pair right away.
  If, for some reason, this feature is disabled, enable it as follows:
  Choose Tools &gt; Options &gt; Editor &gt; Code Completion.
  Select the Insert Closing Brackets Automatically checkbox.
  
  The editor also highlights matching pairs of braces, brackets and quotes.
  For example, place the cursor before any brace or bracket and, if it has a matching pair, both will be highlighted in yellow.
  Single brackets of any type are highlighted in red and the error mark is displayed in the lefthand margin.
  To customize the highlight colors, choose Tools &gt; Options &gt; Fonts &amp; Colors &gt; Highlighting.

The new Code Bubble IDE has been in the news. I wonder if there are useful libraries to implement this kind of interface (for other applications)? I prefer java or python. I understand Code Bubble has been implemented on Eclipse.

It looks more like it's implemented in Squeak Smalltalk using it's interface parts as building blocks and Eclipse as back-end.

You can use some sort of good custom drawing library like Piccolo http://www.piccolo2d.org to build your own blocks and connected them together.

Title: Nested struct viewer for Linux Kernel
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am in the process of tackling the Linux Kernel learning curve and trying to get my head round the information stored in nested struct specifically to resolve a ALSA driver issue.

Hence, I am spending a lot of my time in the source code tracing through structures that have pointers to other structures that in turn have pointers to yet other structures...by which time my head has become so full that I start to loose track of the big picture!

Can anybody point me at either a tool or a website (along the lines of the highly usful Linux Cross Reference http://lxr.linux.no/) that will allow me to, ideally graphically, expand down through the nested struct of the source code?

At the moment we are developing for an Embedded PowerPC in Eclipse CDT version 4.0 but wouldn't be opposed to switching tool chains.

This may sound old fashion but I've found that tracing through data structures with a pencil and paper helps you reverse engineer the code better than tools that automagically do this. So, my recommendation is that you draw them yourself so that you don't have to keep it all in your head. Once you've done this your learning curve becomes a lot less steep.

I am currently using Kdevelop4 (svn version) to walk through the Linux kernel. The navigation capabilities are great, but it takes a big while to parse it (just give it the directories you need, omitting all drivers you are not interested in for example) and is still a little bit crashy.

Once the stability improves and the parser can cache previously parsed data, I think this will become the most convenient way to walk through the kernel.
    
    
Title: ASP.NET MVC markup in VS2008 script has warnings with &ldquo;expected expression&rdquo;
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've searched SO and have been unable to find this question asked before, but I can't believe I'm the only one running into it.  If this is a duplicate, please point me to the original question.

In VS2008, I have some ASP.NET MVC markup in a script section on some of my pages.  I end up getting "expected expression" warning squiggles on the ASP.NET MVC markup even though the jQuery/JavaScript in the preceding code is valid.  It only happens on the markup. 

This doesn't prevent the page from rendering, everything works fine.  It is more an annoyance than anything else.  I've installed VS2k8 SP1 along with the Intellisense hotfix and it still happens.  It also happens whether I'm running R# 4.5 or the 5.0 EAP.

Suggestions or should I just pick my battles when it comes to VS 2008?

Answer 1: 

    
    
The VS designer is not good at handling cases where your markup jumps between server-side and client-side script.
Sometimes adding &lt;%=""%&gt; at the top helps, as per this post: http://forums.asp.net/t/1384577.aspx.
The VS designer also seems slow to pick up changes, re-parse and remove error squiggles.  

In your case I think it's trying to parse that line as Javascript but it's obviously not.  If you're nuts about removing the errors you would have to re-factor the code, eg generate the entire JS script as a server-side string and write it out.

I've learned to view error squiggles as advice only, and once the page is stable and working just ignore them.
    
    
Title: Aptana Alternatives
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am looking for javascript/css editors that are a good alternative to using aptana.

The following are features I care about:

1) "learning-based" auto-complete within the file. Aptana does not necessarily know what all possible auto-complete values are, but it tries to guess based on references in the file.

2) auto-complete for css. A very big feature for me.

3) An integrated JSLint or something similar.

4) The ability to specify jslint header comments in a file. Basically I can indicate which objects, functions, etc are global so that they don't throw unused reference errors when used. This is big because my SSJS framework has a few globally injected functions that we need for things like included files. And I want JSLint to report useful errors vs a bunch of noise.

Anyone know of any decent editor that does this?

As a side note: I use windows/linux not mac. So please constraint on that.

Try Ctrl+Space on Jetbrains Web IDE http://www.jetbrains.com/webide/ in a css file. It can also refactor CSS (Alt+Enter), such, as expand CSS shorthand or optimize expanded CSS to shorthand. IntelliJ CSS auto completion is also awesome if you are working on Java related project.

With a dynamic language like js you're probably not going to do much better on auto-complete than textmate / e. There's a reason so many web developers use it. But you're just never really going to get good auto-complete with a dynamic language.

Title: Eclipse smart quotes - like in Textmate
Description: 
    
    
                    
Happy Friday — Does anyone know if eclipse has the notion of smart quotes like Textmate.  The way it works is to select some words and quote them by simply hitting the " key?  I'm a newbie here so be gentle.  FWIW - I'm using pydev in Eclipse.

Thanks

Rephrase

What I am looking for is given I have a word or phrase selected on the screen, I would like to simply hit the '"' key and have the entire word or phrase enclosed by quotes.  The same would apply to various keys — like ([{"'`.

So say I have the following code

a = {}
a[keyword] = 1


Now (in python) keyword should be in quotes.  I should be able to double click (select) keyword and simply type the ' and then viola the whole word is quoted.  Right now what happens is that keyword is replaced by a single quote...  Sigh..

For Java and XML files you can create a new template in Window / Preferences / Java / Editor / Templates. The template text could look something like this:

"${word_selection}${}"${cursor}


Then you can apply this template activate code completion using a standard Ctrl-Space (may have to hit it 2 or 3 times to get to the template selector) and then select your quote template.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I think I know what you are asking, is it that...

if you press X-key it will select the current word that the cursor is in?

If that is the question, then I don't think so. 
There are lots of possible keybinding that are not set in eclipse. See Window

Title: R function to return code to source code editor in R Studio?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been using R since before its official first release but don't have a lot of knowledge of R Studio's &quot;bells and whistles.&quot;  One thing I was trying to do in R Studio is the following:  I want to write a function (or use some other functionality possibly available in R Studio) that when run, returns source code to the source code editing window in R Studio at the point where the function is called.  This is sort of like an alias, perhaps for a longer block of code.  For example if I have some R code like this:
insertCode(&quot;John Smith&quot;, &quot;August 23, 2020&quot;)
library(tidyverse)

and I execute the first line—or even better, after I type the line and press return, tab or some other character—I'd like R Studio to return some templated code to the window and replace the function (or alternatively place it below my insertCode function call).  In this example, I was thinking the code, when executed or typed, would replace the line insertCode(&quot;John Smith&quot;, &quot;August 23, 2020&quot;) with program description text so that the following would appear in my source code editor:
###############################################
Author:              John Smith
Last Modified:       August 23, 2020
###############################################
library(tidyverse)

I realize I could just save a template of source code and open it up any time I need to do this, but I have other ideas of how I'd like to use this functionality too besides inserting program description headers into my code.  Is this possible somehow?
Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Title: Cloud-based IDE for Docker-based projects?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I want to start converting some of my existing projects over to using Docker - mainly to improve the ease with which new developers can get started working and reduce environment-related bugs when deploying to production (I once had an issue where code worked perfectly in dev and staging only to find out that production had an out-dated version of MySQL)

The problem is that I like working with cloud-based IDEs. I currently use Cloud9, although I've started looking at CodeAnywhere and Codenvy recently to see if they'll fit my needs (so far: uncertain)

The problem I'm running into is that Docker doesn't seem to play nicely with many cloud-based IDEs.


On Cloud9, your project (and associated repository) reside in a "workspace". One workspace is a Docker container running in non-privileged mode, so you cannot run Docker while within the workspace. This means any environment dependencies (Python, PHP, MySQL, etc) must be installed directly to the workspace OS
CodeAnywhere similarly creates a "container" -- a Docker container where your code runs, and within which you cannot run Docker
Codenvy seems a little closer to what I want, in that a "workspace" may consist of multiple "machines". This reminds me very much of a docker-compose.yml file. Your workspace may contain a database machine, a redis cache machine, and a PHP machine. However their hierarchy then places "projects" (and associated repositories) as a child of "workspaces" -- rather than the environment definition (and docker-compose.yml file) being a child of the project


The first two both support some notion of "SSH workspaces" -- instead of connecting to a container hosted by them, you can spin up a VM and connect to it directly. While this would allow me to run Docker, at a first glance it suffers one of two serious issues:


Every project resides in a single "workspace" - making it difficult from the IDE to keep work separate
Every project has their own "workspace", meaning every project has their own VM - leading to large monthly costs


Is there some other cloud-based IDE that will solve my issues, or is there some other way to use one of these three cloud-base IDEs that will work for me?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I asked this question in a few different places and not just here. After several months there has been no complete answer, but I have gained a bit more information that I would like to pass along to anyone who stumbles upon the same issue.

1. Regarding Cloud9 and CodeAnywhere

When spinning up a new SSH workspace, you can specify not only the host, but also the root folder for the workspace. This means you can create multiple workspaces on a single VM and keep everything nice and separate.

There are a few caveats:


In order to truly keep your workspaces separate, you must create a new user for each workspace. Otherwise someone in workspaceA can edit ../workspaceB/file
All workspaces will share the same disk space, so it's possible for someone working in one workspace to fill up the hard drive and cause issues for all other workspaces
There's no easy way to spin up new workspaces. You have to log into the VM as an administrative user, create a new user, create a directory for the workspace, assign permissions, then set up a new SSH workspace. It may be possible to automate a large portion of this, though


2. Regarding CodeAnywhere specifically

CodeAnywhere promised full Docker support in Q4 of 2018. I've been waiting and haven't seen it yet. Keep your fingers crossed.

3. An alternate service

Now in 2018 there are over 50 cloud-based IDEs. Everyone and their mother is making a "me too" business. So it stands to reason that at least one of them will work. While I haven't gone around trying them all, I did hear from someone that OpenShift supports Docker.
    
    
Title: How to exclude/hide specific directories/folders from search in Atom Editor, per project
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a directory with a bunch of Bootstrap versions in it, and every time I search my project for a Boostrap-related classname, I get a list with all the hits from my Bootstrap versions. I need to know how to exclude this directory from searches. I do not want to do this globally, and I'm not looking to use the search/pattern field in the 'find' panel (unless this field can get populated from a config file in the project). I need a solution that will persist every time I open this specific project in the future. Would this configuration be in .editorconfig or config.cson?

I searched for this solution elsewhere, but there's a lot of noise in the threads related to my question, so it's hard to identify the correct/best solution. 

[Edit]: To be clear, I'm not looking to rely on .gitignore, since that will result in files omitted from version control. And I'm not looking to set a preference for fuzzy-finder, since this will be global, and could exclude items in other projects.

[Edit]: This, so far, sounds like a missing feature.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can make use of the Exclude VCS Ignored Paths feature. If you check the box on this entry in Atom's Settings screen, and then add the folder that you want to exclude from the search to your VCS's ignore file (e.g. .gitignore for a Git repo), then entries in that ignored directory will no longer show up in your search results.

So if your folder is called bootstrap-versions, and your project is a Git repo, then adding

bootstrap-versions


to your project's .gitignore file will remove this folder from the search results.



As an alternative to that, you can add the name of the folder to be ignored in the fuzzy-finder Ignored Names field. Go to Settings /emem/emem/emcode/codeem/em/ppem/em/pp/p/div

Title: Different coloured print strings in python - IDLE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using IDLE to just create a short, basic text adventure game. the methods I try work in other editors such as Repl.it or canopy, but I prefer the use of IDLE as I just like the simplicity of it, and that it doesn't require an Internet connection to access. 

I won't mention the methods I tried, as I may have just been approaching them in the entirely wrong way, or maybe IDLE just simply doesn't have the functionality of other editors, but I just want to make the text in the game clearer to distinguish. For example, below is a short segment:

import time

print ("Welcome Traveller!") 
time.sleep(1)
def name_identify():
    print () 
    name_input = input ("What is your name? ").lower() 
    name_input = name_input.title() 
    time.sleep(0.75)
    def name_confirm(): 
        print ()
        print ("So %s is your name then?" % name_input)


Where the questions such as

name_input = input ("What is your name? ").lower()


appear in a different colour, or bold/italic even. As things similar to

print ("\x1B[3mHello World\x1B[23m")


and

print ("\033[1;31m""Hello world") 


don't work, I assume this function is not naturally supported, so I ask, if it is possible to either A, make it supported, so this method, or similar work, or B, another option which does make changes at least similar to what I seek?

It would be very helpful if anyone could provide me with a way to do this, or at the very least an editor which is close in simplicity (design wise) to IDLE and does support the functions I seek. The version of python I am currently using is 3.6.1.

Thanks in advance, and I apologise if my wording confuses you, just ask about what confused you and I will attempt to clarify. Using Windows with the Idle Shell.

I know what you are going through right now, but there is no benefit to make text colored or bold in python without GUI. If somehow you manage to do it it will turn back to normal text when you make the file to exe format. I have wasted a week on this.

It only makes sense when you are reach GUI programming. Tkinter would be a good place to start.

Its does not matter on the IDE but on the compiler.

You may try to exclude ModernTheme250.bpl from the IDE's "Known IDE Package" registry setting:
Open "regedit.exe", navigate to
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Embarcadero\BDS\19.0\Known IDE Packages
find the entry named "$(BDS)\Bin\ModernTheme250.bpl". Edit this entry to change the value(!) [not the name] to start with an underscore _. This will disable this package from beeing loaded and you will get back the old style.
    
    
Title: How to integrate LLVM 5.0 into Visual Studio 2017?
Description: 
    
    
                    
From llvm's site, I can dowload the prebuilt binary of LLVM 4.0. After having installed the prebuilt binary on Windows with Visual Studio 2017, I can easily switch the compiler between VC++ and Clang 4.0 via Platform Toolset options.

From Getting Started with the LLVM System using Microsoft Visual Studio, I can also build LLVM toolchain (result in many executables) on Windows. However, I don't know how to make a prebuilt installer and get the same effects as the official version provided.

Because llvm's site doesn't provide prebuilt binary for LLVM 5.0 (SVN), so I have to do it myself.

Is there a tutorial telling me how to build the installer of LLVM 5.0 (SVN) from LLVM's source code?

Thanks in advance.

==================

Why LLVM 5.0

The following C++17's features are available in LLVM 5.0 only:


Template argument deduction for class templates   
constexpr lambda expressions 

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As a quick hack you can overwrite prebuilt binaries with those you've compiled. Or take a look at &lt;LLVMInstallDir&gt;/tools/msbuild directory, it contains bat scripts to install LLVM toolchain. You can alter and run them to add another toolchain that would use SVN versions.
    
    
Title: How to avoid angular2 giant footprint
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am investigating the development setup for our next developments.

Requirements 


Java, WAR
Javascript, Angular2
JSP, Html, CSS


When doing this with eclipse-neon and nodeeclipse a simple Angular2 "Hello World" will take up giant 

100 MBytes, in words hundred megabytes

nearly all is located in "node_modules".
Generating a WAR results in about 30 MBytes after waiting a long time.

Is there a way to reduce this giant footprint to a reasonable size?



As proposed I investigated both ways using webpack with simple "Hello World" apps

First I tried 
http://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html
. After removing .map-files the total size was 1.1MB. The (packed) WAR comes with 250KB

Second I tried angular-cli. angular-cli creates a set of config-files and a simple "Hello World". After remove .map-files the total size was 3.2MB. the WAR comes with 490KB.

Regarding the size both approaches looks valid. However, we will continue with the first approach since it used explicit config file for webpack. We need to tweak webpack in order to use and support JSP. It is not obvious how this could be done with angular-cli.

If you do not need to tweak the webpack config, you may prefer angular-cli
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In fact this is an experience you make when starting with angular 2 and node. The solution to this is using a package builder like "webpack". I'd recommend to create a starter project with "angular-cli"
https://github.com/angular/angular-cli
and start from there to add your project-specific components, libraries, ...
This makes it possible to jump right into development and testing this feature very quickly. Investigating the mighty and complexity behind that is recommended, but can be done step by step.

The command-line commands for this generated project - you can see them defined in the generated "package.json" - provide all you need to develop and run the code
and also 
e.g. npm run build:prod
...
preparing the code for deployment, including reducing and packing the code to an absolute minimum size (in my case from ~ 120MB to 2.7MB)

If you are trying to import a whole project to your workspace by creating a new application from existing code then that is very easy as long as project you are importing is on already on the folder of your workspace or there is no conflicting project on your workspace with the same name. 

On the other hand if you have a project on your workspace that you are working on and you want to import other projects to it then it becomes challenging especially if you dont have a well define working sets. I suggest that you:


Open particular folders of the project you want to import for instance the "src" folder and copy the java files in it directly to your project on your eclipse (If you are using it)
Right click on the src file on your eclipse and paste the java files.  It will save you the time of changing the package name on the java files.
Do the same for the resources files by copy pasting them from the respective files to the corresponding files in your project. 
Then when you do this dont forget to edit the manifest file with the new changes of the activities you imported. To do this you need to look into the manifest of the project you were importing so that you do not miss a point. 


It may appear tidious and cumbersome but it will help you know what exactly you imported. But you will need to change package names in the java files to the current package name.

Answer 1: 

    
    
The TIDEGradientTabSet (if it's still used in modern Delphi) doesn't support multiline view, so the only option for those IDE experts could be making own tab set control hiding the original one.

Alternatives are:


On the far right of the tabs is a small down arrow. Press that, and you'll see a list of all the files that are open in the editor;
Pressing Ctrl+B will open up a dialog to select a tab;
TMS has a free tool AltTab but it did not get update for while. That was exactly what was needed for Delphi IDE;

Eclipse IDE automatically grays out the inactive branch.

#if 1
    &lt;code 1&gt;
#else
    &lt;code 2&gt;
#endif


For the above code, &lt;code 2&gt; should be grayed out, as it is not active.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Xcode does not have this feature built-in. It may be possible to write an Xcode plugin to accomplish this, but you will face the following problems.


The Xcode plugin API is unsupported and undocumented.
Xcode plugins have to be rewritten for new versions of Xcode
It is actually difficult to determine if code is active or not.


That last point takes some explaining. Let's say you have the following code

#ifndef SOME_UNUSED_DEFINE
    // Some code
#else
    // Some other code
#endif


Usually, the else code will be inactive. However, if the compiler is passed -DSOME_UNUSED_DEFINE, then it is reversed. The ifndef code block is inactive, and the else code is active.

Is there any way to duplicate this behavior? I don't see an option to open a new console and I can't find anything in the advanced properties of the DB connection listed in the DB panel.

I tried installing the Database Navigator plugin, but it seems to duplicate a lot of functionality.  I like the built in one better, but neither seem to support multiple tabs.

Does anyone have any ideas?  It seems like this should be a fairly common use-case.

I don't think it is possible with the built in database support.

Update: PhpStorm 9 built in database manager is now able to open multiple consoles for a given connection. Right click on the connection / New / Console.

Using the Database Navigator plugin however you can have multiple consoles open for a single connection. First open up a SQL console, then at the top bar close to the Execute Statement button there is a settings dropdown. Open that up and at the bottom of that list you will find Create Console.

I'll recommend to use Android-Studio based on IntelliJ IDEA from jetBrains when there will be a v1 release, its UI is clear and effective and the debugger is less annoying than eclipse's one, however native development is a bit tricky unlike eclipse which provides the appropriated plugins when you write your module in C++ (if you do it in C, the compiler will take it as an error when you'll open your file in the IDE).
So I'll develop in native using eclipse until a native module exists for Android Studio.

Description: 
    
    
                    
can anyone recommend tools/plugins that are capable of "normalizing" the coding style of a php document?

Oftentimes I find myself working on outdated codebase by different authors following different or no coding style at all. Before working on those documents, I often find I have to clean up the code and for quite a few things I just do a regexp search &amp; replace, like fixing brace indentation, new lines, dot-connectors, spaces around operators and so forth... 

I use Aptana Studio and like the default php formatting it offers, which is great for writing new code that conforms to a coding style. What I am looking for would ideally be some sort of tool or plugin that could take EXISTING code and even just slightly adopt it to a given coding style (or even set of regexp search &amp; replace's).

Anyone got any hints?

P.S.: Please do note that I am not per se asking for advice on enforcing coding standards, but rather on how to automatize the adaptation of old code base to a coding standard.

Edit: I found this topic Aptana auto format: Aptana supports formatting of code to the active coding style via shortcut cmd + shift + f. From what I've tried so far, it behaves a bit weird and not exactly producing the kind of output I'd expect. So, while this might be something I could get to work, and would still be interested in other solutions to this.

So, i want to do the same, but currently i failed to reach this menu.

I tried IOTAProjectManager interface, which facilitates an adding Project Manager's menu items³, but i learned what its notifiers are isolated from each other, so most probably this API is useless for my purpose.

I think the original Project Page extension does it by installing an IDE Notifier (see TProjectPageNotifier below). I don't think it has anything to do with the Project Manager.

However, I don't know what effect the "Resource Folder" has. The option can be stored in and read from the .dproj file, it's also checked that it exists but I don't know how the original extension uses the folder path. If you find out please let me know, I'll include it in the code.

Also, part of this code is copied from my answer to another question of yours, which I compiled (and briefly tested) in Delphi 2007 and Delphi XE. This code was only compiled and briefly tested in Delphi 2007.

Hope this helps as a starting point, at least.

You could try some form of Revision Control. Programmers don't normally edit the same copy of a document for various practical reasons.

Eclipse has an excellent SVN plug-in called Subclipse. 
    
    
Title: How to make Vala available in my NetBeans IDE for autocomplete or What else can be used for Vala to have autocompletes?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I just ran this code, and it looks like nice language for me. 

But when i was trying in NetBeans IDE i do not see any Vala nor i see any autocomplete availability. 

Any idea how to make NetBeans IDE to allow Vala? (to get auto-complete specially)

e.g:

using Gtk;

int main (string[] args) 
{
    Gtk.init (ref args);

    var window = new Window ();
    window.title = "First GTK+ Program";
    window.border_width = 10;
    window.window_position = WindowPosition.CENTER;
    window.set_default_size (350, 70);
    window.destroy.connect (Gtk.main_quit);

    var button = new Button.with_label ("Click me!");
    button.clicked.connect (() =&gt; {
        button.label = "Thank you";
    });

    window.add (button);
    window.show_all ();

    Gtk.main ();
    return 0;
}


I have tried from here: https://github.com/carbonfx/netbeans-valaproject/downloads
But does not work.



Follow up:


  NetBeans IDE i could not make it someone can update it later!
  
  I installed Anjuta IDE using yum -y install anjuta, and simply Vala works
  
  
  I will try this too: http://yorba.org/valencia/

You could use the Anjuta IDE, or turn Gedit into a Vala IDE using Valencia.

As far as I know, there's no shortcut to navigate between the Error Insight.

See these two images of eclipse project explorer below. The first one has dotted lines (so it's much easier to see the hierarchy), while the second one does not (which is the case for the eclipse on my computer).

How to configure eclipse 3.6 on Windows 7 to display dotted lines?


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Windows 7 removed this tree-view component from application usage, you can read about it here.

http://www.sevenforums.com/customization/25956-windows-explorer-tree-view-connecting-lines.html

In otherwords, you can't add it back, but that link provides a modification which they claim helps out a bit.

It was called "Simple Folder View", you can read about how it was turned on/off in Vista.

Answer 2: 

    
    
You can make the whole app go back to an XP like look by disabling visual themes on the compatibility settings. See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8973912/381161
    
    
Title: Delphi 7 IDE disables some &ldquo;Enhancement Modules&rdquo; on Windows 7 64 bit
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am running Delphi 7 on Windows 7 x64. Everything is working fine except this thing.

When I start the IDE the enhancement modules for key mappings are enabled and working in the default blank project but when I load one of my projects, Delphi disables the keyboard shortcuts from my 2 installed extensions.



I don't have any other extensions installed except the two visible in the above screenshot.

Do anyone have any idea how to get around this issue? It is really driving me crazy ...

Thanks a lot!

I think that it can be related to a crash. I have just installed madExcept and the IDE crashes whenever I load a project. 

Exception is: EOSError with "A call to an OS function failed."

Title: Using Syntax Highlighting
Description: 
    
    
                    

I'm trying to write an IDE for the iOS and I stumbled on a problem. I of course wanted to be able to do syntax highlighting, but I have no idea how I have to get this to work.

I have been googling over a month now, but I haven't found anything useful. Most libraries are C++. That I find no problem, I know enough of C++, but they all use the Boost libraries and I heavily doubt if it's easy to install them on a jailbroken iOS device, or even compile them for the iOS on the Mac.

So I come here for help. What should I do? Should I use a PHP syntax highlighter, which always colors the whole document? Should I write a syntax highlighter my self, that doesn't use the Boost library? Or does somebody here know another library, which can be used on the iOS?

Thank you in advance,
ief2
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
i have a simillar problem about syntax highlighting, but i prefer to solved it using UIWebview than using core text, because that is a different pixel in rendering text in core text and UITextview (in my problem i was using a core text view that cover by uitextview), and then i try to solved using uiwebview, even i'm still on developing but i can say that it is better using uiwebview than core text, maybe you can take a look at this link http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/ it is an open source code, but it develop using javascript.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Most Boost libraries are header-only. There are only a few Boost libraries, like those for threading and asynchronous I/O, that use a compiled library. If you've found some solutions that would work fine aside from your worries about using Boost, then I would look at them again, as they'll likely work. Even if you must use a Boost library that is not header-only, you can always build it as a static library and link that into your application, so that in the end the only thing that needs to be installed is just your app bundle.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I know this is old, but in case anybody is looking for a complete syntax highlighter for iOS, there's two options: 


Highlightr: A Swift library for syntax highlighting, supports hundreds of languages but uses JS as backend. It's fast enough for live editing, though. (Disclaimer: I am the creator of this library).
SyntaxKit: A native solution on early stages of development. Should support any TextMate syntax in the future. 

    
    
Title: Writing custom IDE on top of Eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
I wish to write my own Python IDE (just for the heck of it). I was wondering if I could use Eclipse as a foundation. This will save me from coding a whole lotta things (code editor, intellisense and so on). 

To understand what I mean, please take a look at Visual Studio Isolated Shell. I'm essentially looking for something equivalent. Searching on Google hasn't helped. Is there anything like this available in Eclipse's case?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes. Eclipse is designed to have additional languages added and there is extensive support for this kind of plugin development. I'm surprised Googling didn't help - there's an entire site dedicated to a tutorial on the basics and a toolkit for developing such things
    
    
Title: Refactoring crazy inheritance hierarchies of value objects - How to get a list of all fields and types?
Description: 
    
    
                    
So basically, I need to manually adjust an inheritance hierarchy.  I'd like for the classes to be perfect, no extra fields, and they're just DTO's.  However, it's really easy to get lost and add duplicate fields, and it's really hard to see if what I'm looking for is already there.  Something I'd really love to have is a way to list all the fields within a class, including its inherited fields (private too).  Like a flattened field-only view with no getters and setters cluttering everything up.

I've found a way to show it in netbeans with right-click/File members, but I can't copy-paste and save it in a text file or anything.

Basically just these columns:

Name     Type            Superclass
id       int  
theDate  java.util.Date  com.something.AbstractDTO
...


Anyone know how to do it, or a better way to do what I'm trying to do?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If no pre-existing tool can be found it shouldn't be hard to write something that uses reflection to extract this information from your DTO classes. You'd need to recompile and re-run the program for updates, but that's better than nothing.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can use Eclipse's "Hierarchy View".  When you click on a class you get its members.  Clicking the "Show all inherited members" icon gives you a view sorted by member type (static fields, static methods, instance fields, etc.).  You can select the instance fields in the usual way, right click, and "copy qualified name".  You'll get something like this, which includes where the member was originally defined.

nz.ac.vuw.ecs.kcassell.cluster.MatrixBasedAgglomerativeClusterer.distanceMatrix
nz.ac.vuw.ecs.kcassell.cluster.MatrixBasedAgglomerativeClusterer.originalMatrix
nz.ac.vuw.ecs.kcassell.cluster.DisjointClusterer.originalMatrix
nz.ac.vuw.ecs.kcassell.cluster.DisjointClusterer.originalSeed1
nz.ac.vuw.ecs.kcassell.cluster.DisjointClusterer.originalSeed2
nz.ac.vuw.ecs.kcassell.cluster.MatrixBasedAgglomerativeClusterer.previousIteration
...


In this example, "originalMatrix" is multiply defined.  (It's even easier to see in the hierarchy view.)

Recently after scorching my retinas from the garish white background in Eclipse, I found some of the excellent posts about how to change the colors so it uses sane (i.e. dark background) colors in the editor.  However, one problem present in all solutions is that background of the column with the expanders for code folding is always white.  Is there a way to change the background of that column?

I want to be able to retrieve an SD Card's Serial Number, Manufacturer, and any other information it may provide.  Java or just a command to run would be great.  Compact Framework does it, but that doesn't help me.

You can also try

sudo hwinfo --disk


to get information on your disks, including SD Cards.  

hdparm -i may not work through sdcard controllers
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You may be able to get some info out of "hdparm"

hdparm -i /dev/sda


Gives a bunch of info about /dev/sda which includes its serial number. In my test case, this was a hard drive, but presumably the same may work for a SD card (which looks a lot like a disk to the OS)

I received a src archive from a friend who develops Qt apps on Linux on Kdevelop IDE. Is it possible to load the Kdevelop project in Windows  in some IDE ? Is there a Kdevelop port on Windows without Cygwin/Msys etc ? Are there any workarounds or I should I have to install Linux and take charge?

Update : I visited the page as mentioned in the below answer, but  there's no Kdevelop package in the KdeWin installer . See here
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
KDevelop 4 will also be available on Windows (together with a lot of other KDE4 software). It is currently in beta, but you can download a Windows installer. The installer also lets you install other KDE4 software and should come with the QT development files you will need to develop QT applications.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
AFAICT, there is no port to Windows of Kdevelop4 and Kdevelop3 was run with cygwin - which, IMHO, is not really a robust solution.

It would probably be easier, and better, to install a Linux distro in a virtual machine and go at it from there. If you don't need access to Windows, you could just install a Linux on a separate hardrive and/or partition.

Title: What Java IDEs work well with existing GUIs and may help with conversions?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have an application of some 85 "frames" which was originally written with JBuilder 5 - an early IDE. The app is pure Java and I think it's all mostly Swing and AWT. So, the core question is: What IDEs can help me both maintain my existing application, possibly convert it from standalone to JSP, and hopefully also help with new development via a GUI interface?

Last summer ('08), I downloaded Eclipse and it sure beats JBuilder, except for the lack of a visual GUI WYSIWYG editor - the Visual Editor was dead even then. I like Ganymede (the current version) standard toolset, but lack of a visual editor concerns me. (And, I had a lot of trouble integrating it into an existing development environment.) While it lets you work with existing code, it didn't even have a (current) GUI editor, so working with my old code was the old-fashioned way ("blind").

In doing my homework, I found a company that makes/made a current-version Eclipse-based IDE that had a full-blown GUI environment that they claim make it easy to develop one GUI and then deploy it either as a stand-alone (pure Java) app, or deploy it as a web page (using JSP, etc). And, they suggested, it would let you work with existing applications, something none of the other systems do - that I've found so far. IIRC, it was about $250 for a license.

Unfortunately for me, life-events prevented action at that moment - long story short, I lost the link to their site. I thought it would be no problem to find them again, but the number of "plug-ins" and partners has EXPLODED! They now have nearly 1200 plug ins available and about 60 GUIs! YOWZER!

I came here to SO and got the idea from one of the several questions on "best IDE for Java" that NetBeans 6.5 is worth a look-see. I tried it. It's horrifically slow, even on a 3ghz box with 3G memory, etc. But, it integrated into the environment more quickly and I like its deployment details. I then found out that its GUI environment is only good for new code, and some here on SO suggest that it's a bit brittle and that if you have to hack it much (which I will need to do!) then it may break the ability of the GUI to continue to be editable in the IDE...

I've spent countless hours doing my homework on this, especially including looking here on SO and the web pages to which they often point. A lot of articles on Java IDE GUIs are old now, but I've read them anyway, and learned a lot... 

Ideally, I'd like to find one tool that:


Competently, and without undue hassle works as a modern IDE for Java with a good GUI
Can help convert between types of applications - stand-alone vs JSP (mobile?)
Can work with existing applications (not written using that toolset).
Doesn't hook the code in to proprietary libraries.


If not in one tool, as multiple tools, it would still be nice to have all these abilities!

I do not require "free!"

Your input appreciated!

I suggest you look at Visual Editor again, as it should be able to work with existing code if this code is not too complex (in terms of business logic being mixed with the gui code).

Otherwise your time may be well spent in refactoring out the GUI code to a state where Visual Editor can handle it.  I have not seen other free IDE's which can work with existing code.

If you already have Eclipse, I would recommend trying MyEclipse. This has a plug-in called Matisse4MyEclipse that is a nice GUI builder.

I've used wufoo in the past and like the interface, so short of any other suggestions I'll probably go with that

Title: Configure Emacs FlyMake to use Rakefile as well as Makefile
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have been learning to use Emacs for a little while now. So far liking it a lot.

My problem is that for little C codes I prefer using Rake instead of Make. However flymake does not seem to want anything else than Make. As it complains that it can not find Makefile. From the command line Rake is used in the same way as Make so I was wondering if there was some emacs configuration I could enter to allow Rake to be used by flymake?

To correct a bit what I am doing. I'm not actually editing a Rakefile. And flymake-ruby does not help at all. I'm working with C code. I just use RAKE to compile the c code using gcc instead of MAKE.

Right, got it now; sorry about the earlier confusion.

Taking a quick look through flymake.el, for *.c files, the 'make' invocation ultimately comes from here:

(defun flymake-get-make-cmdline (source base-dir)
  (list "make"
    (list "-s"
          "-C"
          base-dir
          (concat "CHK_SOURCES=" source)
          "SYNTAX_CHECK_MODE=1"
          "check-syntax")))


That gets called by flymake-simple-make-init, which is called because that's what *.c files are mapped to by flymake-allowed-file-name-masks.

So, the right answer would be to modify flymake-allowed-file-name-masks to map *.c files to a different init defun, then write that defun to call rake the way you want. There are a bunch of those defuns already written for various things, and most of them are pretty short and sweet -- so even if you don't know Emacs Lisp, you could probably get something to work with a minimum of futzing. (The really really right answer would be to change flymake-simple-make-init so that the command name was read from a defcustom variable, then submit that change back upstream...)

The quick-and-dirty answer, given that you said all you need to do is call 'rake' with the same args as 'make',  would be to grab a copy of flymake.el, stick it early in your load-path, and munge the 'make' string in flymake-get-make-cmdline to read 'rake' instead. That'll at least get you to the next step...

Rake is Ruby syntax, so simply turning on the flymake for rby in the file should do it.  This link is to someone's elisp code for doing this.  the EmacsWiki has a lot on it as well. (In fact, you should be reading the EmacsWiki in general, lots of useful stuff there.)

To continue with what Charlie said, the FlymakeRuby node on EmacsWiki has exactly the code you need, including the bits to enable it on rakefiles. 
    
    
Title: Eclipse (pydev): Is it possible to assign a shortcut to send selection to the python console?

Question so easy that fitted in the title :)
Eclipse (pydev): Is it possible to assign a shortcut to send selection to the python console?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can only assign shortcuts to "actions". Actions bound to buttons (for example, the toolbar) and menus. If you have a menu for this, you can bind a key to it. If not, then you will have to open an enhancement request in the pydev project.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you mean to the interactive console, use ctrl+alt+enter in the pydev editor (version 1.5).

That action does a number of things:


opens an interactive console view if it's not opened already
sends the selected text to the console
makes an execfile of the current editor (if no text is selected)

    
    
Title: PyCharm raising Unresolved reference + expression expected for mypy ignore based on error code
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am trying to silence mypy errors based on error codes.  This is done using something like this:

from foolib import foo  # type: ignore[attr-defined]


I believe PyCharm is interpreting my type: ignore[code] comments as a type comment, and reporting ignore as an unresolved reference.



Also, PyCharm expects an expression within the brackets.



mypy error I'm trying to suppress:

pylint_ignore.py:8: error: Skipping analyzing 'pylint.utils': found module but no type hints or library stubs  [import]


And yes, I know I can just say type: ignore, and not include a code, or specify to ignore this particular import in a config file.  However, I would like to specify the error codes, because I think it's a good feature.

How can I get PyCharm not to complain about this?



Research

This answer to How do I stop pyCharm from complaining about underscore strings?

Helped me realize under Preferences --&gt; Editor --&gt; Inspections --&gt; Python --&gt; Unresolved references, I can add a fully qualified symbol name to be ignored.

I believe this is officially documented here.

I tried adding *.ignore.* (since I don't want to have to build up a per-module ignore list), but this didn't work.

If this is the right approach, can you help me figure out the right syntax?

Apparently if you put a literal tab character between the # and type:, PyCharm will treat it as a regular comment. As PyCharm normally converts tab to spaces, you will have to copy it in from somewhere, but hey...
