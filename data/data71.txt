Title: CoffeeScript - Configuring SublimeText as a Simple IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am new to CoffeeScript and I would like to experiment with it using SublimeText.

Ideally I would like to emulate the functionality of Fiddle Salad's excellent online editor - specifically I would like to see the OUTPUT - i.e. so that 

console.log 'Hello World' 


actually displays 'Hello World' in the console...

I am on Windows and have followed these instructions and have used the following 'build' file:

{
"cmd": ["coffee.cmd","-c","$file"],
"file_regex": "^(...*?):([0-9]*):?([0-9]*)",
"selector": "source.coffee"
}


This gets me as far as compiling Coffee files to JavaScript, but no further.

Not incidentally, I can't help wondering why this is so hard.  I am keen to learn and (until this point) I did not consider myself a moron, but it seems that web app development is almost deliberately esoteric and overwrought.  Help appreciated.

Getting What you want working

"cmd": ["coffee.cmd","-c","$file"],


The -c in this command stands for compile.  So it is doing what you've asked it to do.  If you want live responsese, what you really want is an REPL (Run-Eval=Print Loop).  

Here's a sublime text plugin that supports coffeescript: SublimeREPL

You also can do the same thing on the command line by just calling the coffee executable.

As far as this goes, you're trying to use a language that compiles down to another language, inside an editor that is designed to have a minimal but extensible base, and want live editing capabilities.  Thats 3 levels of complication/configuration that are not in any way required for web app development.  There's nothing wrong with that persay.  Its a totally valid setup to be developing on.  But most of your complication seems to come from these choices rather than web development in general.

If you want to do some quick web development with instant feedback using coffeescript, consider using one of these online editors that allow you to ignore all this configuration/complexity

CodePen


If you want more IDE features without the configuration complexity consider using an IDE like Webstorm

If you don't want to deal with the complication of compiling down to another language, consider starting with Javascript instead of coffeescript.

You of course don't have to do any of these things, but they might reduce some of the complexity you're complaining of for your use case.

Title: Eclipse: How to open an editor programmatically
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm wondering how I can open an editor programmatically. I first created the appropriated file and then I want to open the editor for this type of file. But I'm not able to open the editor then.

...
IWorkbenchPage page = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage();
PlcEditor editor = new PlcEditor(emfResource);
page.openEditor(editor, "test");
...


I already had the following solution (which works), but here I wasn't able to call the constructr of my editor:

....
IWorkbenchPage page = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow().getActivePage();
IEditorPart openEditor = IDE.openEditor(page, plcFile);
....

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
First you must define your editor to Eclipse using the org.eclipse.ui.editors extension point:

&lt;extension
     point="org.eclipse.ui.editors"&gt;
  &lt;editor
        name="Sample Multi-page Editor"
        extensions="mpe"
        icon="icons/sample.gif"
        contributorClass="tested.editors.MultiPageEditorContributor"
        class="tested.editors.MultiPageEditor"
        id="tested.editors.MultiPageEditor"&gt;
  &lt;/editor&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;


(above is as created by the provided multi-page editor example).

You can then use:

IDE.openEditor(page, file, "tested.editors.MultiPageEditor");


to open the editor on an IFile specifying your editor id, or for the extension specified the editor will be the default and you can just use 

IDE.openEditor(page, file);


You can also use the contentTypeBinding child element of editor to specify content types then editor will handle.
    
    
Title: Eclipse Auto-Correct?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a way to have Eclipse auto-correct certain misspellings? For example, I tend to type "System" as "Sysetm", and Eclipse catches it. However, it only tells me it's an invalid package, and I have to manually correct it. I'm hoping there's a way like in Microsoft Word, where you can add words to be auto-corrected.

Title: How do I show Variable Bindings in SICSTUS&#39; &ldquo;SPIDER&rdquo; IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using the "SPIDER" IDE for SICSTUS Prolog development, as instructed by the SICSTUS Manual and the documentation on the SPIDER IDE itself. When debugging, under the 'SICSTUS Debugging' perspective, the variables do not show on the Variables window, as can be seen in the top right in the image shown here (it's the first thing in the Spider page)

I set up everything according to this guide and this is, as far as I can tell, the only thing not working. Are there any additional steps to get the variable bindings while debugging?

Thanks in advance,

edit: I've recently reinstalled everything in the same system after formatting a drive, and it now works perfectly. I have no idea what, but I assume I did something wrong the first time.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Variable bindings should work by default. However, some variables may be omitted depending on compiler optimizations and other factors. Try it with the example program shown in the SPIDER image.
    
    
Title: Syntax highlighting problems in Scala Eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using the Obsidian theme from Eclipse Color Themes with the Scala Eclipse IDE, and everything looks great except for some values, which show up as a horrible dark blue that's extremely hard to read. It seems to happen for certain vals and not others, but I haven't been able to figure out exactly when it happens, so I don't even know what to look for in my Eclipse setting.

Here's a screenshot from an assignment I'm working on that shows some examples of the problem: 

That's from a Scala JUnit test suite (obviously), where it seems to occur more often than in the main program. I've also found that it rarely occurs in a Scala worksheet, even when the worksheet is an exact copy of the main file. There are instances in the main file of the dark blue highlighting, but the same instance in the worksheet has the correct (or at least, the expected) highlighting.

Any ideas? I'm guessing it might just be some incompatibility with the theme and the Scala IDE, but I really dislike the default ultra-bright theme, so I'm hoping to be able to use a darker theme without this annoying problem.

Title: Development oriented PostgreSQL IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
Could someone recommend PostgreSQL IDE oriented on developers, not on database architects or administrators. I.e. I look for an IDE that will increase my productivity in:

1. Writing stored functions (code completion and syntax highlighting)
2. Ctr+Click navigation between functions (or any other way)
3. Finding All References (where certain function or table is used)
4. Refactoring stored functions (renaming function or variable; extracting function etc.)
5. Refactoring tables (if I change column name, functions and views that uses that column should be also updated)
6. Structuring my functions during the development into kind of folders (let them be finally flatten on the database)

The project that I currently working on has hundreds of tables and more than thousand of functions. Currently I work with pgAdmin and my productivity is extremely low.
All database development tools that I checked so far from (http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Community_Guide_to_PostgreSQL_GUI_Tools) do NOT cover even 10% of what I expect from a modern IDE.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I think the Toad plugin for Eclipse is going to be the closest thing you can find.  Unfortunately, having a totally comprehensive IDE with these features is going to be a huge project in part because PostgreSQL can use stored procedures in so many different languages, so syntax highlighting inside the stored procedure requires a vast amount of knowledge (in theory, to be considered complete, not only sql and plpgsql but also C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, TCL, R, Ruby, Lisp, various shells, PHP, Lolcode, and Brainfuck -- there are probably more but those are the ones that come to my mind).  Consequently the only hope of doing this is to tie into another IDE.

This being said I, and most devs I know, tend to use bash, vim, etc.   It is a fundamentally different paradigm but it is more flexible in many ways, and the limitations you do run up against force you to design, and test, your SQL in sane ways.

I don't make use of Qt Creator's UI design functionality.

For a new project, I'd like to experience working with Xcode. This will be a regular Qt project, developed using C++ and Qt libraries just like in Qt Creator.

I have of course done my search but nothing seems to be clear about directions and not having any experience with OS X or Xcode makes it complicated so therefore I'd really appreciate your patient, step-by-step input for this. Various how-tos available online are not of satisfactory.

Answer 1: 

    
    
You should have a look at CMake. It uses a simple language to define projects in text files and then generates the native project files for your environment (eg XCode).

Assuming your project structure looks like this:
    myproject/
        MyProject.h
        MyProject.cpp
        main.cpp
        MyGui.ui

Add the following as CMakeLists.txt in the same directory:

cmake_mimimum_required( VERSION 2.8)

project( MyProject )

find_package( Qt4 COMPONENTS QtGui &lt;insert components you need&gt; REQUIRED)
include( ${QT_USE_FILE} )

# Qt's includes are already taken care of by the previous command
# add any additionaly include directories if required
# include "binary" dir to make sure the automatically generated files (eg for gui class) are found
include_directories( ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} )

# assuming MyProject contains a Q_OBJECT that needs to be processed by moc
QT4_WRAP_CPP( MOCS MyProject.h )   

QT4_WRAP_UI( UI MyGui.ui )

add_executable( MyProject 
      MyProject.cpp
      MyProject.h
      ${MOCS}
      ${UI}
)

target_link_libraries( MyProject ${QT_LIBRARIES} )


Create the "binary" directory. This directory will contain your XCode files and any files that are generated during the project (compiled objects etc). Thus, CMake allows easy separation of generated files from your source code so it doesn't mess up your source control. 

In the binary directory, call:

cmake -G XCode &lt;path to your source directory (where CMakeLists.txt is)&gt;


You could also use the GUI tool CMake-Gui or console gui ccmake.

After cmake finished generating the project files, open them in XCode. 

For more details, check the CMake documentation

Happy coding!

It looks like that project has a pom file named m2-pom.xml.  You should import that as a maven project.  Assuming it's using standard repositories, you'll immediately be able to compile the code with maven.  

You can select Open in the menu, and then choose that file and it should load the project.

Be aware this seems to be a clojure project.  You might want to research the La Clojure plugin to see how/if it can import clojure projects with it.  It looks like the steps I gave will work, but the code may not run very easily for you without the La Clojure plugin.

I had tried to debug with Eclipse + Chrome debugger plugin but failed, I posted the error in this session &#39;Failed to get tabs for debugging&#39; when trying to debug NodeJs with chrome debugger for Eclipse, but could not find an answer.

However, as Node.js is so popular, I have no doubt that a lot developers have the solution for debugging Node.js server JavaScript code.

I would suggest using node-inspector.  Here is a good tutorial for setting it up.  It allows you to use a browser tab to look at your code, set breakpoints, and step through it.  Additionally, you can start node with the flag --debug-brk and it will insert a break point on the first line, if you need to debug something that happens on startup.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There are several tools to debug a node application. A great ressource has been postet on Github recently.

A simple debugging setup might be just adding a breakpoint to your code and start node in debug mode like this:

Example code with use of debugger, a manual breakpoint.

app.get('/foo', function(req, res) {
    var something = 123;
    debugger; // execution stops if this point is reached
    foo(something);
});


Start node in debug mode:

$ node debug app.js


Once you started the application in debug mode you use the application (e.g., navigate to the ressource with your browser) and once a breakpoint occurs, the execution stops and you have a debugger environment in your terminal.

Answer 1: 

    
    
What is identity server version that you are using? In Identity Server (V 4.0.0), when you upload a policy, it would do schema validation.  If your policy is not according to the schema, policy uploading would be failed.

However you can disable policy schema validation by setting following property to "false" in entitlement.properties file which can be found at /repository/conf/security 

PDP.SchemaValidation.Enable=false

Also you can simply create policy with WSO2 Identity Server policy editor UI. I guess this blog post [1] may be useful. But it has been written for Version 3.2.3.  May not be valid for 4.0.0. version 

Sorry. I have not used UMU-Xacml-Editor.

That's awesome! Now, how can i accomplish the samething when running .rb scripts? I admit it might be a bit strange to evaluate every single line in a script, but it is awesome when learning. 
So - cannot reproduce this behaviour in other IDE's (or calling .rb scripts from a command prompt) with integrated console/terminals. I've tried Aptana, jEdit, RubyMine.

I've read alot about different constants that could be set, such as $DEBUG, $VERBOSE, and calling ruby.exe with some parameters, but i don't seem to get it right anywhere.

Write a file named test_ruby with the following content:

#!/usr/bin/env ruby

File.open("path_to_test_ruby_file/test_ruby_file"){|io| p eval(io.read)}

Give test_ruby an executable status.

Description: 
    
    
                    
At work we are using a proprietary language and to program we are using Notepad++ with a simple code highlight. That is really annoying so, what I want to do is to invest some time to setup a text editor or an existing IDE to support my language.

I've googled a lot and there are so many options and before starting to work I wanna ask to you what is the best choice.
What I want to do is to have, like an IDE, a syntax highlight, a window with the function list tree, with the local function variables inside the same subtree, maybe text autocomplete (if I type "pro" I would like to see the suggestion "procedure" and if I press enter it will write for me something like

procedure "name" {
   --code--
}


with the cursor on "name" ready to change it.
etc etc...

Can you suggest me the right path to follow?
Is it to keep using Notepad++? With sourcecookifier? functionlist?
Or I have to change to another text editor?
Or there is some famous IDE like Eclipse, NetBeans etc that allow to easily add my own language?

PS. my language is pretty simple, I don't have complex structures, is Pascal-like. Something like that:

variable int  xyz
PROCEDURE asd
BEGIN
END PROCEDURE asd

I would recommend you to stay with Notepad++ and extend it with some plugins and configuration. This would be fairly quick and easy to set up and still give a big win, even though you might not be able to get all the nice features of something like Eclipse. But since you already know the Notepad++ it wouldn't require learning an entirely new tool. 

Some plugins that I have found useful


Function List 
Light Explorer
XBrackets Lite


There are probably a lot more that can be useful to you. 

Notepad++ also got some built in auto-completion functionality that can be enabled in the settings.

The only IDE I have used for the last few years is Eclipse.  There are lots of other IDEs available, also notable and popular is Netbeans.  There are many others.  It's important to note that all IDEs have their fans, but I can only speak to Eclipse.

Eclipse is a platform, which means it is an application on which you can build other applications.  Eclipse provides a framework which you can customize and extend to produce a working application.  It takes care of the user interface, preferences storage, modularisation using OSGi, and lots of other things.

Eclipse has facilities to support what you're looking for:


Syntax highlighting in the editor.
The Outline View provides function and variable listing in a tree
Autocompletion and Suggestions (activated by hitting ctrl-space)
Code Templates to fill out files and procedures etc.


The disadvantage is that customising and extending Eclipse to do what you want isn't trivial.  Having written a language debugger for Eclipse, I can tell you that leveraging Eclipse's platform helped enormously, but there's a learning curve.  You'd essentially have to be coming up with a new set of plugins to provide your highlighting, outlining, autocomplete suggestions and templates (I'm not sure if template support is built into the platform or not).

So I would say, unless you can find some sort of extensible editor for Eclipse - I know Aptana is extensible for tag-based markup - you are probably as well staying with your existing tooling.

Do explore the other IDEs though - I've heard good things about IDEA as well as Netbeans. :)

Good luck!

Title: Remote IDE on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.5
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have this version of Linux server:

-bash-3.2$ cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.6.18-194.11.1.el5 (mockbuild@hs20-bc2-3.build.redhat.com) (gcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-48)) #1 SMP Tue Jul 27 05:45:06 EDT 2010
-bash-3.2$ cat /etc/*release*
cat: /etc/lsb-release.d: Is a directory
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.5 (Tikanga)


Currently, I am writing c program on the Linux side, I will need the server power to execute my program. I prefer IDE, but since my machine is Windows and what not, I have to compile the program remotely on the server. Sometimes, it's such a pain that I cannot run a stacktrace after the program crashes. And the thing is I want is to achieve higher productivity. 

I can only access this server with PuTTY or the like, and I do not have the rights to install any software. And updating the software in the server is also not possible.

I see that the server got programs like Matlab that can output to XMing on the client side. (Ex. I can run Matlab as a GUI from the server side and have it display on my client device) 

I see that some people suggest me for Eclipse, but the IDE is way too slow. In fact, it lowers productivity.

So is there any recommendation or a scheme that will allow me to compile, execute and debug my program remotely on the server with better ease-of-use, given the bold criteria above?

You cannot install as root, but maybe you can manually install applications in your user directory? With that and X11 forwarding you should be set (except a bit of latency).
Also, if you have gdb on the remote (which you probably do since you also have the compiler) you can see stack traces with it after enabling core dumps (ulimit -c unlimited), by opening the binary and the core file: gdb -c  , then bt.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Case: One source file has a comment in it that is directly linked to a comment in another source file (it says see line 315 in xxx.cs for more information). The problem with this approach is that the comment on line 315 may not be at that line number in the future. Is there a way to link comments together in an IDE? (currently using Visual Studio 2010, but use other IDEs from time to time)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can try this addin (I haven't used this):

http://hyperaddin.codeplex.com/

Besides this addin, the only thing I can think of is using a file link to directly go to the linked file; something like:

// ...
// See file://path_to_file
//...


The link will be converted to an actual link that you can click using Ctrl+Left Click but it won't take you to a given line number - it just opens the file.

The path can be a relative file path or a full file path - full paths work best if all team members use the same folder structure in the project. For example:

// file://w:/projects/GUI/frmMain.cs
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Referring to a particular source file and line number is never a good idea, because someone might move things around in the other file without being aware that something is pointing at it. It's better to point at the particular type/method, for example See DoThings() in the MyThing class..

In Java, using Javadoc, you can use @link to do this, for instance See {@link MyThing#doThings()}. Eclipse will automatically update these when using its refactoring tools (e.g. renaming the class or the method). If the change is done manually, Eclipse will still warn that the target of the @link is invalid. (There is also @see which is more appropriate in some situations.)

I'm not sure about C# and Visual Studio, but it's likely that its XML-based doc format offers similar functionality.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The only way to handle this is to put the comment in the same file. Duplicating a comment is not the same as duplicating code, although ideally the code wouldn't need too much explanation in comments.

There are many, many reasons why the comment being in another file will cause pain. As you have stated, the line number may change but also it could be deleted (as they won't know another comment references it), updated in a way that changes its meaning and it is annoying to have to open another file in any case.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a way to make eclipse simulate Intellij statement-wise ctrl+shift+up ctrl+shift+down line movement? (like changing indentation, or moving code blocks)? 

UPD, beg my pardon, alt up/down indeed changes indentation. But what about next:

@Override
protected void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    if(currentPath == null || currentPath.length() == 0) {
        showDirectoryView(settings.getRootUri());
    }       
}


cursor stands on method declaration, I use alt down

@Override
    super.onStart();
protected void onStart() {
    if(currentPath == null || currentPath.length() == 0) {
        showDirectoryView(settings.getRootUri());
    }       
}


Intellij just swaps this method with the next one, 
same about code blocks

ALT + Up/Down Arrow - for rows indentation in Eclipse.

I implemented a python program using subprocess.Popen to execute commands from server to Ubuntu client. The subprocess must read all outputs line by line. My program operates perfectly  in Eclipse environment. All outputs print as I expected. 
But when I run the program under Python interactive shell (in both Windows and Linux), subprocess.Popen didnot read all command outputs. The outputs only show little and then Python crashes without any error. Here is my program codes:

def execute(self, IP_Instance, command):

    keypairs_directory = Config.keypairs_directory

    cmd = 'ssh ubuntu@%s'%IP_Instance+' -i %s'%keypairs_directory+' %s'%command

    cmd_run = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
    for line in cmd_run.stdout:
        print line         
    cmd_run.wait()


For example, when I send a command:

a.execute('xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx', 'ls -l')


I have output 

total 0


It is OK. But when I send:

a.execute('xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx', 'sudo apt-get update')


The program only runs to

The apt-get update command returns data also in standard error, so you need to catch also stderr data:

and then you have to use both Popen.stdout and Popen.stderr.

  I have to mention that watching variables works well.


When you set the watchpoint on a variable, GDB probably says Hardware watchpoint N (but your IDE may be hiding that message).

When you set a watchpoint on anything larger than 8 bytes on x86 processor, GDB can not set a hardware watchpoint (because x86 hardware doesn't support such watchpoints). GDB sets a software watchpoint instead. Software watchpoints are implemented as follows:

Description: 
    
    
                    
Maybe this question is very specific for me, but I'll give it a try. Here's the scenario:


In Delphi XE2 the shortcut "Ctrl+Shift+7" toggles bookmark  (likewise Ctrl+Shift+[1..9] for the other bookmarks)
I have installed ModelMaker Tools (v. 9.1.0, but I believe I had this error earlier also), where I have assigned the shortcut "Shift+Ctrl+Alt+Y" to "Sync Declaration/Implementation".


Whenever I use the ModelMaker shortcut I also set the bookmark (7). Why is this? Note that contrary to the "real" shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+7) the bookmark isn't toggled, only set. 

This behaviour puzzles me. Does anyone have an explanation? It's not a big problem, since I rarely use that many bookmarks, but it got me curious.

For a couple of refactorings, ModelMaker Code Explorer sets some bookmarks for your convenience.

It is documented somewhere, but I forgot where (:

Edit: it is documented here.


  All refactoring operations that modify the IDE edit buffers

  to how Extract Method drops bookmarks #8 at the original code and #9
  at the extracted method. The bookmark numbers can be customized on the
  History Tab which also allows disabling dropping specific bookmarks.

I currently use 2005 express.  But, am open to upgrading.

A couple things that might be close enough:


add an "external tool" to the Tools menu. In the "Tools | External Tools..." dialog:


Click "Add" and give the new tool whatever name you want
Command: %systemroot%\system32\cmd.exe
Argument: /k "c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86
Initial directory: $(TargetDir) // (or whatever appropriate macro)

Right click on a open document's tab and select "Open containing folder"


My VS 2005 Standard IDE already had a "Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt" tool, but it landed the command window in the VC installation directory.  Changing the "Argument" and "Initial directory" fields as above made it land in the project's target directory.

The drawbacks are they don't show up in the right menu for the project and they might not land you exactly where you want, but they should land you pretty close.

No sure this is what you want but the "Open file" icon will pop up a FileOpen dialog in the project folder. From there you can right click the Release or Debug folders to open them in an Explorer (and Cancel the dialog).

Title: Remote development - Edit on Windows &amp; Build on Linux
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am looking for a solution for a remote development environment as follows:
Editor - Windows Source Insight / Visual Studio
Source control - Clearcase
Build server - Linux
The above can't be modified.

In my current setup, I can view and edit the sources on Windows using a Windows Cleacase client.
My problem is mainly the build (and the later on, the debug) process.
I need to invoke 'make' from Windows on a specific Clearcase view on the Linux Server.
I can login in a separate process using SSH to the Linux server and run 'make', but it is a cumbersome procedure.
I am also unable to view the 'make' results and double-lick them to go to the specific warning/errors.

Is there any way to remotely bind a Windows command/batch to a Linux environment?
Perhaps through SSH?
Thank you for any suggestion you might have.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The usual solution is rather a pull strategy (where your build server fetches information on Linux, rather than trying to pilot everything from Windows.

If you follow the SSH path, be aware of technote swg21351507:


  Linux SSH connection hangs when attempting to exit after starting ClearCase.
  
  This can affect the use of scripts to start/stop ClearCase remotely using SSH.
  
  Cause
  
  This is a due to a OpenSSH server design, which will not close the console until all process/jobs executed by the user are completed.
  
  Refer to this SSH FAQ for further details, regarding background jobs.
  
  Resolving the problem
  
  Redirect the ClearCase start script to either /dev/null or to a log file.
  
  Example:


/usr/atria/etc/clearcase start &lt; /dev/null &gt;&amp; /dev/null
/usr/atria/etc/clearcase start &lt; /tmp/ccstart &gt;&amp; /tmp/ccstart

Try sshfs. I don't if there is a sshfs client for windows. If not, you can try NFS, or even SAMBA. Those definately work in Windows and Linux.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I just came across this and wanted to answer, even if the original poster has surely resolved their issue.  This could be quite easily resolved by installing a jenkins instance on the build machine.  You could kick off the build from the web interface and have it pull the files from clearcase and tell you the results.
    
    
Title: Getting auto-completion to work in an IDE using Coffeescript and external Javascript libraries such as jQuery
Description: 
    
    
                    
I would like to ask how other more experienced Coffeescript developers are using their respective IDE's or editors with auto-complete when developing modular libraries and / or referencing external Javascript libraries (jQuery, jQuery UI, RequireJS, Handlebars, ...).

As much as I've tried various IDE's and plug-ins for Coffeescript, none of these seem to support auto-completion when the project consists of several script files. For example: in Visual Studio I can add a commented directive such as /// &lt;reference path="/js/jquery.js" /&gt;. I'd need something similar for Coffeescript.

I have tried following without success:


Visual Studio with Web Workbench by Mindscape
Netbeans with dstepanov's Coffeescript plug-in
Aptana with the Coffeescript ruble


Further, I am aware of Jetbrain's WebStorm 3.x support for Coffeescript, unfortunately, my evaluation period expired before I realized I'd need this feature - can anyone confirm that setting the Javascript / Coffeescript Usage Scope works as expected with auto-complete?

So effectively what I am asking: is there an IDE or plug-in, commercial or otherwise,  enabling auto-complete for Coffeescript libraries spanning multiple files?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Hate to answer my own question, but after giving JetBrains WebStorm 3.0.2 another demo run on another box, I figured it worked best and does have 'smarter than average' auto-complete for coffeescript projects. It simply loads all coffeescript files in to a global auto-complete context and you can add external libs (cs or js) as well using the project's scope settings. Could be better, but for now I cannot find any other IDE or tool running on PC or Linux, OSS or paid, that tops WebStorm and I don't have the fortunes to explore OSX alleys.

I am sure future tools, plugins, IDE's will pop up for various platforms that do offer great coffeescript module management and proper contextual auto-completion in the editor. So please, do keep the suggestions coming.

Thanks!

I personnaly use Kdevelop. I can't remember if I installed a plugins or something to get it work with coffeescript.
But it works very well, the highlighting colors are pretty, when ctrl+d it add coffeescript commentary and so on.
Also I do make compilation directly in KDevleop.

Well also it's free, I am using it on linux debian but I think it works on most platforms.

Title: Will Embarcadero RadPHP XE2 scale to an e-commerce site?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In a nutshell: is RadPHP a toy? or can you build real web sites, such as a e-commerce/shopping carts app that will:


Support 100s of simultaneous users on a reasonably good web server, like any other PHP app 

my specific concern is the RPCL library might be bloated and inefficient

Be easy to assign the CSS hooks and integrate CSS files supplied by designers
Be as easy as 'plain' PHP programming is to talk to external sites such as payment gateways
Easily integrate third party components; Javascript and PHP e.g. Lightbox, eg CKEditor.


I am coming from a Delphi background, not PHP, so please excuse my ignorance and trouble at evaluating RadPHP XE2's potential as an easier way to transition to web development without sacrificing potential to scale.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

It has a demo app created for oscommerce the well known open source e-commerce app.
Yes
No appearent barrier.
It already has components integrating 3rd party stuff such as zend, qooxdoo, jquery etc..


I'm also coming from delphi background with almost no php. Currently I'm developing a prado framework based ERP application using eclipse as ide. On my leisure time I'm toying with radphp, and I think we could have used it as well as the eclipse-prado kit but I'm in no place to make the decision. In my experience radphp is developing well into form. The first releases / versions were really sluggish. But XE2 looks solid. If vcl for php is fine tuned for performance in the future releases, radphp will have better days.

Do you mean it's asking you to set a master password?  If so, this is indicative that Netbeans is unable to communicate with the operating system's native keyring.  You can see what the problem is or disable that message entirely, if so.

The best way to "save" source code is in a version control system. My preference is Git.

Specifically:

Can you drag "Compile Output" or "projects" to be at a different location than they are by default?



More generally:

I am very accustomed to using Eclipse IDE... where every item viewed in the default perspective can be dragged... put into a tabbed view... etc. For now I have to use qtcreator... and I can't figure out how to drag/move each GUI item. (It would help me if your answer compares to Eclipse IDE when talking about qtcreator because I understand Eclipse IDE much better.)

Are all qtcreator GUI elements able to be user draggable and customized like in Eclipse IDE in a UNIFORM manner?

Or are only some of the GUI elements in qtcreator able to be user draggable?

I have a perl CGI script that needs to have a specific extensionless filename to run correctly from the software that uses it.

Found the solution to this, thought I might throw it in here if someone has a similar problem later and runs into this.

What I did was create a link to the script, and gave the link a .pl extension. This happily caused Eclipse to parse the syntax correctly. Problem solved.
