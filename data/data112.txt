Eclipse is the IDE of my choice so I searched for a solution to write Swift-based apps in Eclipse.
I found the following project: swiftclipse.

It seems very useful but the problem is that I've no idea how to include it in my Eclipse installation.

That project does not contain any useful code. It is just a feature project with two plugins each of which only contains an Activator. It has also not had any activity since last June.

I recently purchased the Nextion 2.4" touchscreen. I have run some test code that allows me to switch images on the current page. The image will overlap the buttons when the image is called. Is there a way to have the button be on the lop layer at all times, that is to say, is there a way to make the buttons have higher priority?

Title: PhpStorm in built server not finding post parameters and cannot modify header information error
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am currently learning PHP and I've decided to switch to the JetBrains PhpStorm from my regular editor + WAMP configuration and after copy-pasting few examples I did earlier I have found that its inbuilt server is not behaving properly (for me at least).

Currently I have a project setup with two files:

index.html:

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;form action="welcome.php" method="post"&gt;
    Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    E-mail: &lt;input type="text" name="email"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


welcome.php:

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

Welcome &lt;?php echo $_POST["name"]; ?&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your email address is: &lt;?php echo $_POST["email"]; ?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


This is a basic PHP Forms example from W3schools that works as expected on my WAMP configuration, but when I run it with PhpStorm after inputing email and name I get the following output on welcome.php:


Deprecated: Automatically populating $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. To avoid this warning set 'always_populate_raw_post_data' to '-1' in php.ini and use the php://input stream instead. in Unknown on line 0

Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent in Unknown on line 0
Welcome
Notice: Undefined index: name in D:\deve\PhpstormProjects\untitled\welcome.php on line 4

Your email address is:
Notice: Undefined index: email in D:\deve\PhpstormProjects\untitled\welcome.php on line 5


The ..$HTTP_RAW.. and ...Cannot modify header information... warnings show up no matter what php script is running on the welcome.php but only with the PHP 5.6 while the same warnings are absent when I am using PHP 7.0 interpreter. 

The ..Undefined index.. error shows up only when I am using the post method.

I've tried:


reinstalling
trying few different PHP Versions: PHP 7.0 (solves the first pair of
errors), 5.6.20 and 5.6.16 both x86 and x64
setting always_populate_raw_post_data to different values including -1 made no difference


Again it's worth mentioning that I had no problems on WAMP. I am using PHP 5.6.16 there. Any help is appreciated in getting this thing to work as intended!

I need to set a variable that is checked in the makefile(i.e. at compile time), but I can't find it in the project properties.

I right-click on the project, but can't find a place to set environment vars, except in the Run but even there it seems I can't add a variable (nothing happens when I click on Add after expanding the ...).

What am I missing?



As a side: Netbeans probably will run a shell before issuing the commands like make, what kind of shell is it? how can I configure it?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Judging by your screenshot that you are on OSX, you should be able to set an environment variable by replacing "${OUTPUT_PATH}" under Run Directory with FOO=BAR;"${OUTPUT_PATH}". This is normal POSIX syntax for running a program with a specific environment variable or set of variables set, and can be used at the terminal as well.

Edit: In Netbeans, to set an environment variable for a specific action, right click on project, go to Properties-

How can I move this ugly thing?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In your case you should have a drag handle (the dots) on the bottom left of your screen (minimize &amp; maximize window to make them appear). Maybe this also depends on your OS window system, as Eclipse is based on SWT.

It is a pity you cannot put this footer bar somewhere else than left or bottom as it is mostly empty ...
I suppose using Eclipse Fullscreen would remove it.

Description: 
    
    
                    
The Java IDE "DrJava" has an interactions pane which allows you to type in single lines of code and have it interpreted on the go (sort of like python IDLE). How is this possible given that Java code has to be compiled? It also keeps track of variables and even classes.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It might actually use a compiler - either the one included in JDK or for example  "Eclipse Compiler for Java". The only other option is to parse the source code to AST and execute it - which is close to creating new programming language. 
Looking at FAQ: http://www.drjava.org/faq.shtml#interactions-differences it seems like it is actually custom JVM language and it only looks very similar to Java.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Eclipse looks for .project files when importing existing eclipse projects. If you create an eclipse project for existing code, you can simply create a project and point it to the right folder, and specify the layout for source and target.

Answer 1: 

    
    
You can get the highlighting you want by disabling the "TODO Comment" inspection. The inspection is disabled by default, so you must have enabled it yourself.

As the description shown on your screenshot says, the inspection is intended to be used in batch mode (when you run Analyze | Inspect Code manually), and not for on-the-fly editor highlighting.

You need only company package. company-go is not required. The following config works for me:

  ;; enable company mode for autocompletion
  (add-hook 'go-mode-hook (lambda ()
                            (set (make-local-variable 'company-backends) '(company-go))
                            (company-mode)))


Flycheck is also highly recommended (go support works out of the box):

  ;; enable flycheck
  (add-hook 'go-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)

I know it's not a vital problem, but it occupies my mind. As you can see in the image, Android Studio shows a nice preview of some images in the editor's sidebar.
There are 3 PNG images with the same format and same dimensions. But Android Studio only shows the preview for just two of them.
I'm using Android Studio 2.0 Beta 2 .



Does anyone knows the reason behind or is there any special property for the images to be able to be previewed by Android Studio?

I'll appreciate any answer.

File =/lili
Answer 1: 

    
    
ASSUMING that the file name ends in .c and not .c++ (which was not posted)

you opened an new class rather than a new C source file which was probably an error.

the posted code:

/* Hello World program */

#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;

main()
{
   printf("Hello World");
}


contains several problems. (which compiler problems you saw wasn't posted)

ASSUMING that you enabled all the compiler warnings  (which was not posted_)

ASSUMING that you setup the library paths AND installed the libraries (which was not posted)

ASSUMING that you selected one of the two configurations (debug, release) (which was not posted)


the returned value from main() must be int.
the printf() will raise a warning message.


The code should be written similar to the following:

/* Hello World program */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main( void )
{
    printf("%s\n", "Hello World");
}

    
    
Title: TextWrangler does not highlight PHP &amp; HTML codes properly

TextWrangler for Mac (v5.0.2) sometimes cannot highlight HTML &amp; PHP codes (mixed) properly, given that the syntax is perfectly correct.



How to resolve this issue?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can select "PHP in HTML" option from footer/status bar in TextWrangler as shown in the image. Moreover make sure extension of the file is php. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
This is a known issue for both TextWrangler and BBEdit. The work-around is to select another programming language on the bottom left, and then reselect PHP in HTML. It seems that some actions trigger this bug.

Title: Refactoring issue (Netbeans 8.1)
Description: 
    
    
                    
Im using netbeans to develop some of my php projects. Everything worked fine until it received version 8.1 updates.

Now, when i try to refactor a class method for example, it pops a message "You can not refactor because this file is not part of an open project"
(I don't know if it says the exact same words in the english version because it's installed with my native lang pack)

I just tried to exclude the entire project and did my checkout again (Im using subversion as version control for this project), but it keeps blocking me from refactoriong.

I am sure those files are part of an open project . Here's the screenshot:



Any help would be very appreciated.

~Edit:

Example of refactoring:

I have this public method inside my "Controller" class:

   /**
     * 
     * @return array
     */
    public function getAll(){
        return $this-&gt;_controllerData;
    }


Just trying to rename it to getData instead.

Title: GHC Haskell tooling paths
Description: 
    
    
                    
What are the paths required to set up development environment with GHC project? Or more specifically, a stack managed GHC environment?

I'm confused about what is needed by GHC, cabal, stack, ghc-mod and hdevtools.

I know that stack path will print out managed paths but I think it prints them under different key names than environment variables or command line arguments which I need for GHC and other tools, so it's not directly useful to me. 

For example, when working with typical Java project I need only to set PATH, JAVA_HOME and all tooling I need will work in this environment (for Java I often don't need separate maven repository for each project as linking is done differently).

Ideally I'd like to call stack $SHELL and have everything configured in environment (no stack ghci afterwards).
    

        
Title: Remove Android Studio &ldquo;changed lines&rdquo; popup that covers scrollbar
Description: 
    
    
                    
On OSX using Android Studio 1.5.1, I'm getting "changed lines" popups that cover the scrollbar on the right and prevent me from scrolling.  They're pervasive and require extra attention to get the right combination of clicks and mouse movement to regain control of the scroll bar from this hijacking.

How do I stop this popup?  It isn't useful at all for me.

The popup covers the scrollbar for other things too, like TODOs.

It appears that two messages combine into a correct popup to the left, that doesn't cover the scrollbar.  So... whatever is responsible for this popup knows how to do things correctly, but chooses not to in some cases.

These two images are at the far right, the scrollbar.




  This blocks clicks and makes it difficult to scroll.





  This is more reasonable, but still unnecessary for my needs.


I did find a thread on this subject, but I do not want to turn syntax highlighting off.  Also, it appears that for some configurations these popups are click-through so they don't interfere with functionality.  No so for me, unfortunately.
Intellij Idea 14 - disable highlighting level messages

I tried disabling plugins, but the functionality appears to be in the core (or the core set of plugins for Android Studio).

Has anyone else seen this?  Is there a preference that can just disable these change line popups?
    

        
Title: IDE use a VM compiler?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm starting to work on my master thesis at the moment and I have a (maybe) specific question...
I want to stay on windows OS and run a Linux VM via VirtualBox combined with Vagrant. No Problem. I like the feature to reset the VM via vagrant easily.
The next target is using features like auto-completing or similar while developing in C++. This would help me to work with unknown includes/libraries.
Is it possible to access the filesystem/compiler of the VM while using an IDE (like clion) installed on windows? Without explicit loading of the gui und running the IDE on it? Kinda like working with cygwin? I don't want to use cygwin because it doesn't support c++11 standard (or is there a way???)

Maybe you know an alternative way. I would be glad for all hints solving my problem. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't know much about cygwin, though I would be surprised if they cannot get recent versions of gcc. But for certain, you can use MSYS2 to get very recent versions of gcc and many other linux packages, which will support C++11.

It's a matter of opinion how best to do cross-platform development, but an alternative worth mentioning is to use cmake for your project. When you want to code in windows, it can make MSVC 2015 project files for you -- when you want to compile in linux, it can find the dependencies and generate a makefile for you to use. IIUC, cmake is the most widely used cross-platform build system right now, besides gnu make itself. (I'm pretty sure it's more popular than "autotools" nowadays, and its definitely more popular than scons.) The advantage is that you avoid the need to maintain multiple platform-specific project files that essentially say the same thing with different formatting.
