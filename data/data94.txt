Title: Preserving syntax highlighting of echoed html in a php if statement
Description: 
    
    
                    
I saw in other questions that this was possible, but simply dropping the quotes gave me an error (unexpected '&lt;'). I would like the html code to highlight as does the php around it.

if ($loggedin)
{
//echoes the logged in header.
    echo &lt;b&gt;$user&lt;/b&gt;
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcmembers.php?view=$user'&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; |
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcmembers.php'&gt;Members&lt;/a&gt; |
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcfriends.php'&gt;Friends&lt;/a&gt; |
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcmessages.php'&gt;Messages&lt;/a&gt; |
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcprofile.php'&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt; |
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rclogout.php'&gt;Log out&lt;/a&gt;;
}


I don't know if the solution involves which text editor or IDE I use, some small syntax mistake, or the overall structure of the code. I would just like everything to highlight nicely, even if this involves putting it in a separate file or what. I don't really know what templating is, but I'll use it if it's the way to go.

You could rewrite like so:

&lt;?php if($loggedin): ?&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;?php echo $user ?&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcmembers.php?view=&lt;?php echo $user ?&gt;'&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; |
    &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcmembers.php'&gt;Members&lt;/a&gt; |
&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;


Alternative Control Syntax: http://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.alternative-syntax.php

You could also use short echo tags, so:

&lt;?php echo $somevar ?&gt; would become &lt;?= $somevar ?&gt;

Short syntax is only available by default in a href="http://www.php.net/echo" rel="nofollow"/a/pp/ppre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"code/code/prep/p/div
Answer 2: 

    
    
Have you gone through the HEREDOC syntax ? 

&lt;?php
if ($loggedin)
{
//echoes the logged in header.
    echo &lt;&lt;&lt;HTML
     &lt;b&gt;$user&lt;/b&gt;
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcmembers.php?view=$user'&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; |
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcmembers.php'&gt;Members&lt;/a&gt; |
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcfriends.php'&gt;Friends&lt;/a&gt; |
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcmessages.php'&gt;Messages&lt;/a&gt; |
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rcprofile.php'&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt; |
         &lt;a href='phpscripts/rclogout.php'&gt;Log out&lt;/a&gt;;
HTML;
}




This edit is especially for Your Common Sense.

Title: How to display summary table of errors from build results in NetBeans?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Can I display the build results in NetBeans in the similar form that Eclipse provides? That is, in a table where every error takes a single row?

Currently, NetBeans is giving me raw unparsed textual output from the Ant build. It has hyperlinks to problematic lines, but it is less comfortable than what I am used to from Eclipse.

Here is the screenshot from Eclipse:

You can open Window menu and choose Action Items (or click ctrl+6 ).
on the left side, you can choose if you want it to list for the editied file/selected project/ all projects.
you can also define a filter (filter icon on left side of the action items window) and there you can define a filter that lists only compilation errors. open the filter editor and you will see the options.

I write a program in java using weka to classify my data.

The first version uses ArffLoader to load .Arff files and that version can run without any problem.

However, when I change my code to uses CSVLoader, I run into a following error:

I have already change the target file to .CSV files and imported:

import weka.core.Instances;
import weka.core.converters.ArffLoader;
import weka.core.converters.CSVLoader;


Can someone tell me what's the problem? The only thing I changed is from using ArffLoader, I tried to use CSVLoader instead.

Title: MySQL style tabs on Toad for MySQL
Description: 
    
    
                    
Recently I switched from MySQL Workbench to Toad for MySQL and is beginning to like its powerful features. One thing I do miss is the was MySQL manage connections. Every DB Connection in MySQL workbench is a Tab window and then each editor specific to the connection are sub-tabs within the connection tab. You know what I'm saying if you have used MySQL Workbench.

But on Toad for MySQL, every connection and each editor are tabs on same level. It gets messy when you have a lot of connections open. Is there a way to get the MySQL workbench style layout of connections and editor tabs on Toad? I don't think I'm the first one to feel this way.

Thanks!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't believe you can, but you can hide document tabs for other connections. That would clean up the view.

I am using Aptana Studio for Mac and would like to know how I can select a block of code and remove the indentation/whitespace. I know you can select a block of code and hit the tab button to indent it, but I need to do the reverse of that if it makes sense.

Example: This:

    if() {
        if(){

        }

When multiple lines are selected, Tab and Shift-Tab indent and dedent these lines.

That's an interesting issue!

tl/dr: you have an empty project 'auth' in your workspace, either create some dummy class inside it or go to Run -/ppa href="http://fantom.org/doc/docLang/Env.html#PathEnv" rel="nofollow"/a/pp/pprecode/code/prep/pp/pprecode/code/prep/pprecode/code/prepa href="https://github.com/xored/f4/issues/25" rel="nofollow"/a/p/div
Answer 2: 

    
    
I thought the problem had something to do with the forward slash at the end of path as shown in this line of the error message

Invalid Uri scheme for local file: c:\dev\f4workspace\auth\bin\fan/


However, I found that such path didn't exist. I manually created both the bin and the fan folders and the error disappeared. To be honest I don't really know why F4 needs and checks for that folder because so far it hasn't written any file in it.
    
    
Title: How can I change dxdebug.remote_host before lunch PHP Script debug in PHPStrom?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have remote server where I have xdebug extension installed, and it works perfectly with web application. But now I want to debug console application, and here I have a troubles.

PHPStorm

I am trying to set -dxdebug.remote_host=*** in debug configuration -/emcode/code/pp/pp/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
"PHP Script" type of Run/Debug Configuration (which you are trying to use) is to run/debug php script in CLI (console) mode on the SAME computer where IDE is running. You cannot launch CLI script on remote machine via this functionality, therefore providing your own -dxdebug.remote_host=*** does not makes much sense here.

But yes -- you can debug remotely executed CLI scripts -- you just need to make some adjustments to xdebug as well as pass some special environment variables. Remote script needs to be launched manually though (not via Run/Debug configuration for sure -- maybe remote external tools may help here).

It's all described here:

Description: 
    
    
                    
I would like to debug a same C# console project from two different instances of Visual Studio to increase my productivity, as the edit-and-continue mode is not always enough, to say the least.

I have no problem opening the solution twice, and debugging different projects concurrently, but when I try debugging the same project twice, it expectedly fails as it cannot replace the executables in the bin folders.

The possibility to debug twice from the same instance of the IDE as explained here is very welcome, but not good enough for me as I want to be able to completely edit my code when needed.

Is there any simple way to achieve this? Thanks!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Instead of clicking Debug or hitting F5, open a command prompt and start the number of instances you want from there. Now start as few or as many Visual Studio instances you want and go to the debug -kbd/kbd/ppa href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/3s68z0b3.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"/a/ppimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YJ2Le.jpg" alt="Attach to process window"/pp/p/div
Answer 2: 

    
    
Just as a note for whoever stumbles upon this page, as it's ranked very high on Google:

If you want to debug two instances of the same program in Visual Studio, this is as simple as opening up two instances of visual studio and pressing f5 in each instance. This works remarkably well, although you want to wait until one program is up and running before you start the second - otherwise you may get conflicts in your bin folder (which is what it seems OP didn't do.)

I am familiar with cinder but I've never added a third party c++ library to a cinder project.  I need to use the midi parsing power of the JUCE api but don't know how to proceed in installing the library and then including it in my build.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Though I'm not familiar with Cinder, I am quite familiar with JUCE. From what I gathered about Cinder, it's being a very basic cross-platform application framework, mores a platform, for doing really cool graphics stuff, but not nearly as general purpose as JUCE is. JUCE does not have to be the main() for your application. You can pull JUCE modules into your project on an as-needed basis. Read about JUCE's modular architecture here: http://www.juce.com/features.
    
    
Title: Simultaneous paste and copy of selection text
Description: 
    
    
                    
Background
I want to be able to select some text, hit a keystroke that pastes what is on the clipboard over that selection, but at the same time copying that selection to the clipboard.  I often find myself doing this operation when switching variables, etc from place to place.

Example  

First sentence here, I need to switch it with the second sentence below.   (ctrl-c)
...
Second sentence here, I am going to put this where the first one is.

///////

First sentence here, I need to switch it with the second sentence below.
...
First sentence here, I need to switch it with the second sentence below. (ctrl-"vc" after selecting second sentence, first sentence pasted, second sentence copied now)

///////

Second sentence here, I am going to put this where the first one is. (ctrl-v)

First sentence here, I need to switch it with the second sentence below.

My question
Does anyone know if any IDE/software supports such a paste/copy functionality?  Has anyone ever run into this?

More specifically, does any one know how to set up a keyboard shortcut to do this in sublime text 2?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can do it with a plugin. I threw this together rather quickly. I don't do anything special for multiple cursors (though it should take the content of multiple cursors as well as paste to all the proper locations). 

import sublime
import sublime_plugin

class PasteAndCopyCommand(sublime_plugin.TextCommand):
    def run(self, edit):
        view = self.view
        current_content = []
        cursors = view.sel()
        for cursor in cursors:
            current_content.append(view.substr(cursor))

        for cursor in cursors:
            view.replace(edit, cursor, sublime.get_clipboard())

        sublime.set_clipboard("\n".join(current_content))


After you save the plugin, use paste_and_copy as the the command for your key binding or command palette entry.

Everything seems ok in your config so I checked using a small project and it appears that the problem may come from the redundant namespaces you are using in your XML headers.

Try modifying the following this:

&lt;beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
        xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
        xsi:schemaLocation="
http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.2.3.xsd
http://www.springframework.org/schema/context http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-3.2.3.xsd"&gt;


To result in something like this:

&lt;beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd"&gt;


If that does not work you can also tweak your .iml file by doing the following:

org.jetbrains.idea.maven.project.MavenProjectsManager.isMavenModule="true". You can test quickly by replacing true with false and let IntelliJ reload your project.
I don't know why IntelliJ ignore your spring.xml file, but if you use 2 separate directories for sources and resources, as Maven suggests, your problem should disappear.

You should also create the directory src/main/resources and place your spring.xml file there.

Hope this helps.

Sometimes this can be a problem with the working dir. This blog post explains the problem and how to fix it.

IntelliJ differs from Eclipse in that it sets the working directory to project root which may not be the same as the top level directory of the module you are working on. 

This can be fixed in the run configurations by setting the working directory to $MODULE_DIR$.

If this helps maybe set the working directory in Default JUnit run configuration as well as
and fixing all remaining run configurations.
    
    
Title: Is there a good PHP editor with user defined/custom code completion for MacOS?
Description: 
    
    
                    
By UDF code completion, I mean that if I have a function called:

function get_whoopee($a, $b, $c) { } in filex.php,

and I type "get_wh" from anotherfile.php, it will enumerate all functions matching that prefix (get_wh*) with prototype to jog my failing memory.

I can't explain to you how useful that is if you already don't know.  Of course our prototypes should be straightforward, but this feature is productive.

I expect at least 1 comment telling me "real men use vi or emacs."  I'll upvote you for your (predictable) sense of humor.

The worst part is that I simply can't find a good one since ZendStudio 5.5.  The new one is based on Eclipse and absolutely terrible.  Coda, so far as I can tell has code completion but only within a file.  I don't understand the point of that.  I really don't.  The reason you need code completion is so you can reference stuff that isn't nearby, and preferably even if the file is not open.

Easy to install plugins that add support for myriad things. e.g. LESS, SCSS, CoffeeScript, NodeJS, much more.
A ton of other useful features


Check out the trial, spend a little time configuring the settings. e.g. I've added many live templates, set up PHPCS, code style, etc.

Become familiar with the keyboard shortcuts for quickly navigating/finding files &amp; symbols (objects, methods, functions) Cmd+Shift+N, Cmd+Shift+Alt+N. Pretty sure most of that is in the Quick Tips dialog.

Title: The memory model when bios transfers control to AHCI expansion ROM?
Description: 
    
    
                    
As I knew the AHCI expansion ROM uses IDP(Index/Data pair) to access the AHCI registers(global and Port registers). 

The ahci spec v1.3 says:


  The IDP mechanism allows host software to access all of the MMIO
  registers using indirect I/O addressing


Thus even ABAR is above 1MB, expansion ROM still can access MMIO in real mode via this way.

But we found within expansion below way is OK when accessing AHCI MMIO registers:

push 0000h
pop es         ; set es = 0
mov bx, F732h
shl ebx, 16
mov bx, 0000h  ; put ABAR to ebx register
mov eax, es:[ebx]  ; read AHCI CAP registers to eax(4byte)


If above is OK then it implies the memory model now is not real mode(I guess it's big-real mode,that is, access under 4G is ok)

Our question is if the memory model when BIOS transfers control to Expansion is big-real mode nowadays (anyway, not real-mode) ? If yes then we can always use the memory operation to access AHCI's MMIO... It is correct ?


The reason why IDP used before might be: at that time when control is passed to expansion is still real mode, right ? So the memory model is dependent on system BIOS, right ? 

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Is the memory model when BIOS transfers control to the Expansion ROM in big real mode? Not always.  

In general, the system will probably be in big real mode, but if you are developing a ROM that will run on an arbitrary BIOS, this is not a safe assumption! If the BIOS supports PMM (Post Memory Manager), then the system is supposed to be in big real mode, otherwise there is no assurance of this. As far as I know, even if the BIOS support PMM, only the initial option ROM execution is guaranteed to be in big real mode.

It would probably be safer to:


Only use legacy I/O access for the AHCI registers (this is also the easiest)
Check to see if the BIOS supports PMM first, then either use legacy I/O or MMIO (but only during BIOS option ROM init)
Go ahead and put the CPU in to big real mode and use MMIO to access those registers (for bonus points, you could put the system back to the state you found it in, but most BIOSs will clean up after you)


The reason why IDP used before might be: at that time when control is passed to expansion is still real mode, right ? Not exactly.  

It's mostly likely because it is the safest and easiest option, since there is no assurance the system will be in big real mode (and would therefore be safe to use MMIO access above 1MB).

So the memory model is dependent on system BIOS, right ? No (with a caveat).  

The system should be in real mode when the BIOS hands off control (to a boot loader or option ROM). Big real mode is basically an extension of this mode, but the BIOS will not put the system in other other mode (any protected mode, long mode, etc).

  We developed an ide we want to implement some git functions in this ide. like in visual studio.


Visual studio relies on LibGit2Sharp, a .Net binding to libgit2 to interact with local and remote git repositories. More on the underlying architecture in Martin Woddward's talk at TechEd 2013.

Of course, depending on the language your IDE is built with you may choose to pick another binding (ruby: Rugged, python: Pygit2, ...). You can find more information about existing bindings on the libgit2 project page.

Title: AS3: How do IDEs extract class inheritance info?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm wondering what the simplest way would be to get -- in my own custom code -- a complete AS3 inheritance tree and inherited members for every class:


Search catalog.xml for each SWC, then find each appropriate class file listed in the catalog, and parse it?
Or some other, much simpler way?


In other words, I require full awareness of the AS3 inheritance chain (all core and custom classes), including public and protected members belonging to superclasses which may appear in subclasses. This info is to be plugged into a language converter I am writing (AS3-/pp/ppcode/code/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
To access the full dependency graph, including private and internal APIs, you will have to use bytecode introspection - parsing class (text) files will not yield any information on imported classes from .SWC libraries.  Have a look at the AVM2 specification for more info on ActionScript bytecode.

If you're going to be working in AS3, you can access type information for any class at runtime, using describeType().  However, its scope is limited (only public members are included), and it is heavy on performance, so you will have to implement some kind of caching mechanism, and perhaps tweak your XML parsing, too.

If you want to save yourself the trouble, check out as3commons-reflect.  It provides all of the above, along with a very convenient API.  Anytime you're using reflections on more than the odd rare occasion, I highly recommend it - you'll save yourself a lot of time and energy writing what others have already written ;).

Also, if you need access to private and internal members, or if you want to manipulate classes at runtime, there's as3commons-bytecode, which works on the actual bytecode of loaded classes, and allows for all kinds of voodoo and dark magic.

Title: IntelliJ Idea 12: Specify which javac when using External Build
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been a long-time Eclipse user, but at the suggestion of a few coworkers I've begun playing around with IntelliJ IDEA 12, and I love it.  Though I'm having an issue with the External Build option, namely, it doesn't seem to utilize the javac related to the SDK I've assigned to a Module, it just uses whatever is on my PATH.

At least that's my current assumption; the javac on my path is for my JDK7 install, but I work on some code that needs to be JDK6 compliant.  If I set both the SDK and Language Level to 1.6/6 respectively, it tries to build against Java 7 and I get an Invalid Source Release: 1.7 error; this happens even if I completely remove the SDK for 1.7 from the available SDK's.  Switching External Build off fixes the problem.

I'd like to leverage external build, since it's out of process and is quite quick.  Is this a bug in IDEA 12 or am I doing something wrong?

I'm using Community Edition, if that's relevant.

Edit: I'm using OS X, if that matters
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Make sure that 'Project bytecode version' set to 1.6 in File | Settings | Compiler | Java Compiler. Based on this comment it works without external build option most brobably because "IDEA when invoking compiler forcibly sets language level to the maximal one supported by jdk".

This will sound a bit weird, but i think what you're looking for is a Cross Compiler, and a Cloud IDE that gives you the ability to install whatever tools you need (such as Cross Compilers).

The only one that i am aware of is Koding, since they give you a full Ubuntu VM with Root. You are able to install whatever tools you need, so in this case it should work.

Now, you didn't specify a specific language so it's hard to give you help in that regard, but if you're looking for a "Windows-specific" language such as C#/.NET, have a look at Mono. Mono, with a Cross Compiler, could compile the bin you need on Koding and then you would just download the exe from them.

Title: Regular JUnit in an Android project
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been trying to figure out how to include standard JUnit 3.x (or even JUnit4.x) tests in my Android applications. I want to use JUnit over the Android unit test tools because it is faster and runs directly in my IDE (where the Android JUnit tools need to be deployed to the device or emulator 1st). I also want to use JUnit to impose proper SoC (Separation of Concerns). Originally I had set up multiple modules to allow for this, the Main Android module and a core library module where the main module would have all of the Android specifics and the core module would have Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) and JUnit goodness. 

Recently I started working on an Android project where I developed a library to handle some low level android specific work and expose it as high level operations to the main module. The problem is that I need to use JUnit in the library module but I don't want to break out yet another module to do so. In an ideal world I would have:

Main module: includes all the high level UI and controller logic to navigate between activities, fragments, etc. Depends on MyLib.

MyLib: Contains high level interfaces wrapping low level logic to handle things such as android specific networking, persistence, accelerometer reads, etc. Lots of POJOs involved in some of the low level logic. Also includes an example or demo app to exercise these interfaces directly. Includes the ability to run JUnit on the POJOs.

Am I living a pipe dream or is there a way to intelligently set this up using current development tools? I use IntelliJ Idea primarily but would be open to an Eclipse specific solution as well.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The problem you will run into with running your tests directly in the JUnit test runner is that you will not be able to call any com.android.* classes.  That is because these classes, in android.jar, are stubbed out in your SDK.  Only the Dalvik- byte code versions of these have actual implementations those only run in the emulator.

Avoiding calls into com.android.* classes is very difficult, especially given that so many Android methods require a Context.

I too find this a bit frustrating because the emulator is slow to launch and slow to execute code.  It makes test development very tedious.

The only luck I have had using the JUnit test runner w/out the emulator is to create a separate, non-Android project that points at my project files.  This allowed my to launch JUnits outside of the emulator, however I was very limited in what classes I could actually test.  
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
In short


Use Junit for testing classes and static methods.

How to set compiler in embarcadero C++ builder? I want to set bcc64 as a compiler, but cannot see the option for it, and my projects are being compiled with bcc32.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The IDE chooses the compiler for you, based on what type of file is being compiled and what Platform it is being compiled for.  If you want to compile a 64-bit executable, you have to go into the Project Manager and add a 64-bit Platform to the project first and then set it as the active Platform.  A project can have multiple Platforms added, each with its own set of configuration options.  This is covered in detail on Embarcadero's online wiki.
    
    
Title: how to manipulate the line-visiting history in emacs?
Description: 
    
    
                    
in eclipse, there is a shortcut Alt-LeftArrow to jump to the last line visited. i wonder whether there are similar functions in emacs's coding tools, for example cedet.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can jump to last visited lines in the current file by calling C-u C-SPACE. 

You can call this command repeatedly so you will visit all lines in mark ring.

Actually, emacs keeps two mark rings - local and global. To jump to the latest mark in the global ring call C-x C-SPACE. And you can do this repeatedly as for the local mark ring.
    
    
Title: How to open Query Analyser (window) in Aqua Data
Description: 
    
    
                    
To open Query Analyser (QA) in Aqua Data Studio (ADS), I now right-click a table in de navigationpane en then select Script Object To Window As followed by SELECT

This is becoming cumbersome. Is there an easier why to accomplish this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Before trying to open Query Analyzer, make sure you are connected to a server first!



To open QA in ADS, do one of the following:


Use the computer keyboard command: Ctrl+Q 
(or Ctrl+Shift+W to open QA in a separate window).
Click Server on the Toolbar and select Query Analyzer.
In the navigation-bar, Right-click any node that is showing under your connected server and select Query Analyzer.

    
    
Title: Is there a free cross-platform IDE that will except the Air SDK 3.4 and package HTML5/CSS3 documents to EXE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm running two systems, one Linux and another Windows 7. I need a FREE IDE that could work on either platform which can use the new Adobe Air SDK (3.4 at the time of this question) and package the project as a windows executable.

I'm currently using Aptana 2.0 with the old Air SDK 1.5, however, this does not recognize HTML5 / CSS3.

I have tried so far;
Eclipse Juno, nothing...
Aptana 3.0, nothing...
Titanium Studio, nothing...

If you need to know the reason, I need to make a local app that will run on windows and no, I don't want it to run locally in a browser.

I've also searched the net. If anyone could help me out, that would be great.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use the latest Adobe AIR SDK with Aptana Studio 2.0.


Download the latest Adobe AIR SDK and extract its contents to the "plugins" directory which is within the Aptana Studio program directory.
Open Aptana and go to the "Window" menu and select "Preferences".
Expand the "Aptana" menu item in the sidebar and select "AIR SDKs".
Click on the "Add" button.
Click the "Browse" button and select the directory which you extracted to your "plugins" directory at Step 1, and then supply a name for the SDK eg. "Adobe AIR SDK 3.4".
Click "OK" to save.
Click "OK" again to dismiss the Preferences window.


Now you have successfully installed the latest Adobe AIR SDK.

Now you will want to run your project with the latest Adobe AIR SDK which you have just installed so:


Go to the "Run" menu and select "Run Configurations...".
Where it says "Adobe AIR SDK", select from the drop down the version of the SDK which you would like to run your project with.

    
    
Title: Semantic checking doesn&#39;t work in Qt Creator 2.5
Description: 
    
    
                    


I don't get an error for this obviously erroneous code sample. Instead, qt creator mark var as unused variable. Is it possible to fix this strange behavior? I want semantic checking working.

Update: 
I've been talking about on the fly semantic checking. Most IDE's analyse code as you type, and highlite errors. Qt Creator seemd to do some code analisis on the fly (because syntax highliting shows differently types, virtual functions and other things), but it doesn't hightlte errors at all.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The code model used by Qt Creator is pretty good but is not based on a complete abstract syntax tree for each compilation unit. Some information about it is provided in this Qt blog post:

http://blog.qt.digia.com/2011/10/19/qt-creator-and-clang/

AFAIK, the current code model allows Qt Creator to do semantic highlighting, refactoring, displaying type hierarchies etc. but does not allow a complete on-the fly check for potential compile errors (like yours). Since the syntax of your code is correct, Qt Creator does not show an error.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Very strange behavior. I tried to compile such code:

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    UndefinedType val;
    cout&lt;&lt;"Test"&lt;&lt;endl;
    return 0;
}


On My Qt 4.8.1, 4.8.3 with MinGW on Windows7, in QtCreator 2.5.2, but in every case got error:

main.cpp: In function 'int main()':
main.cpp:7:5: error: 'UndefinedType' was not declared in this scope
main.cpp:7:19: error: expected ';' before 'val'


Please, provide more information about your build environment.

I cannot seem to click on much inside of Eclipse Juno. I cannot run my projects, and even when I try to do something like Windows -&gt; Preferences nothing pops up for Preferences, and I get no response. I have tried Refresh, Clean, and restarting both Eclipse and my system. Still nothing. I opened Eclipse via command line and got some output, but have no idea what it means.

Title: Unable to start Eclipse Helios
Description: 
    
    
                    
I just installed Eclipse Helios. Once I unzipped and opened the Eclipse it asked for my workspace. I selected the path and it said ok. It opened the workspace and said workbench loading and suddenly the Eclipse IDE closed and in the main Eclipse folder I got a hs_err_pid6040 text file which appeared as log.

Below is the content of the logfile. I'm just including a part of it. The rest shows process, other threads, VM arguments, Env variables and my system config info. I don't understand what the error is or how to debug. Please help.

  Q: i see a bug raised. No solution?


A: You didn't look closely enough.  The bug was noted in your version (6.04), and fixed in subsequent releases:

Upgrade your JVM :)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Is it possible that you have multiple JDKs installed on your system and Eclipse is picking up the incorrect one ?

Please check the VM by editing your eclipse.ini (This should be inside the folder where you extracted or installed Eclipse Helios)

In order to do so please see the documentation here.

In short, you'll need to add or correct the -vm argument inside the eclipse.ini to point to the javaw.exe of the JDK you want to use, like so :

-vm
c:/Program Files/Java/jdk/bin/javaw.exe


Correct the path above to point to your javaw.exe.

Thought it's out of the scope of OP's question, you may want to try thinking about using the path of the jvm.dll instead of javaw.exe. See this
    
    
Title: In what IDE / compiler can I develop C++ code that will be deployed on FreeBSD server.
Description: 
    
    
                    
MY code will be deployed on FreeBSD. Would I be able to code using VS2010 in Win7? can this be done on Linux using gcc? or do I need to have freebsd installed on my laptop. 

I plan on buying a new ultrabook and not sure FreeBSD will support the drivers or wireless. What the best practice here? VMs? 

Thanks mods. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can just write code in Visual Studio, however you will not be able to compile and run it in Windows, unless you are only using standard libraries.

To compile and test your code you need a FreeBSD somewhere. 

I have never used FreeBSD on a laptop, so I can't say if dualbooting it with Windows is a good idea.

The best thing would be if you had access to a test server with the same configuration as your production server (i.e. same FreeBSD version, same packages, etc.). Then you could write code in VS, check it into a repository, SSH to the server, update a local copy of the source there and build.

If that is not an option, I recommend setting up a virtual environment. Download VirtualBox, obtain FreeBSD and install it on the VM. Set up port forwarding for SSH and then the process is pretty much the same as with a separate server. You may have to make some additional tweaks depending on the nature of the work you'll be doing.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Here is a setup I have used in cases where I am not using any OS specific library.


On your Windows 7 machine develop your application as usual without using MFC/ATL etc. If you are linking to external libraries/APIs you will have to use one which is portable across Windows and Linux (e.g. Boost libraries). Do not use pre-compiled headers (stdfax.h) or any other option which is Windows specific.
Get VirtualBox and install your favorite OS (FreeBSD in this case) and your favorite tool chain (gcc clang)
Share the disk/folder you are developing your app in the Windows file system so that it is visible in VirtualBox. In Ubuntu they end up in the /media/sf_Folder.
Compile in FreeBSD in VirtualBox. You will need to have an alternative make system setup in parallel in addition to the stuff Visual Studio creates. Make sure you do not have any conflicts in the way the directories used by the build system (to store object files etc.) between FreeBSD and Windows. You can try out this http://code.google.com/p/make-it-so/ to convert your VS solutions to gcc makefiles.


This way you can continue to use your favorite IDE and also rebuild on your target *ix OS on the same machine.

Title: Is there a way to get eclipse to automatically detect a space/tab mismatch the way Visual Studio does?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Visual Studio 2010, when I open a source code file that has a mix of tabs and spaces, a message will appear warning me as such and give me a chance to correct it.  Is there such a feature in Eclipse whether native or via plugins?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I have not noticed such a feature, but there are settings you can change so you can detect it yourself. Essentially I show whitespace characters (specifically tabs and spaces). To show whitespace characters:

Preferences &gt; General &gt; Editors &gt; Text Editors &gt; Show whitespace characters


Click on the "whitespace characters" link to modify which whitespaces characters to show.

Then modify your language formatters to enforced tabs over spaces (or vice versa). Then when you format code (Ctrl+Shift+F) it will enforce the convention you set in your formatter. This has the other side effect of formatting the rest of your code, but that might not be a bad thing.

If you want to remove trailing whitespace when you format your code, you can do that by editing your "Clean Up" profile and clicking the "Remove trailing whitespace" option int the "Code Organizing" tab
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Admittedly, this is not as nice as Visual Studio's solution and very similar to the answer above, but here's how I resolved this.

Title: Emacs: Mode doesn&#39;t load on startup
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Emacs under Win64. I want to load a mode called gas-mode.el on startup.

What I wrote:

C-x C-f c:/Program Files (x86)/emacs-23.1/.emacs

(autoload 'gas-mode "c:/Program Files (x86)/emacs-23.1/lips/gas-mode.el")
(setq auto-mode-alist 
     (append '(("\\.asm\\'" . gas-mode) ("\\.inc\\'" . gas-mode))
             auto-mode-alist))

C-x C-s
C-x C-c

&lt;Restarting...&gt;

M-x gas-mode


Emacs' answer:

I never got a response different to:

[No match]


My Question:

How can I get Emacs to autoload gas-mode.el on startup? Any idea? Thanks.

Where my .emacs user init file's located:

Emacs tells me that I can find it in my the emacs folder of my program directory:

user-init-file

C-j

"c:/Program Files (x86)/emacs-23.1/.emacs"

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I dont know too much about lisp or emacs lisp but you can go to the .emacs file where ever it is located. Then in that file add this code 

(load "c:/Program Files (x86)/emacs-23.1/lips/gas-mode.el") 


Also in your load path you have "lips" and i believe it should be "lisp" so that might be one of the issues.

One more thing, you don't have to restart emacs every time you can go to the last parenthesis and do C-x C-e which will evaluate the form. To evaluate the bugger you would do M-X load-file /.emacs
