I have several devices connected to Android Studio 3.5.
To run on all devices I need to make monkey job and all time click "Run on several device" and all time select devices one by one.

Is any solution to store selected devices to start from one button as it was in Android Studio 3.4?

Yeah. I too faced the same problem. But I got the solution.
You can Install a Plugin from the Marketplace - Android Studio.
Android Run On Multiple Devices. After installation, connect all the devices you wanted to run the app. Then use CTRL+SHIFT+F10 then ENTER. it will run the app in all the devices you have connected to.

    
    
Title: Writing gem5 configuration scripts with Pycharm
Description: 
    
    
                    
In order to develop complex gem5 python configuration scripts with more convenient IDE the gem5 lib has to be added 
to the project. However, for those who are not experts in python and Pycharm (Such as myself) 
there are some difficulties. 

For those who are unfamiliar with gem5, this is 
a short explanation: 

gem5 is an open source simulator that inspects hardware architecture. 
It can be downloaded from github: link to github. 
The installation process is described at the following link. 

&lt;gem5_installation_dir&gt;/gem5/configs/learning_gem5/part1


Inside the above path, there is a basic python script file: simple.py 
This file contains some imports. 
Editing this file with Pycharm requires some dependencies that are located in the gem5 installation directory. 
The questions: 
1) How to add those dependencies of gem5 into Pycharm? 
2) How to config the Pycharm with gem5 execution command?  

Any help would be appreciated. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
A few pointers from what I see at gem5 d9cb548d83fa81858599807f54b52e5be35a6b03 (May 2020) under gem5/configs/learning_gem5/part1/two_level.py:


from common: common is at configs/common which gets found because of the above m5.util.addToPath('../../') call, so add configs/ to the PYTHONPATH as shown at: PyCharm and PYTHONPATH
import m5 comes from src/python/m5 so add src/python to the PYTHONPATH as above
from caches import * comes from the sibling learning_gem5/part1/caches.py, so likely this will be found automatically by PyCharm. Otherwise add that directory to the PYTHONPATH.
from m5.objects import *: this is likely the one you are really interested in as it contains all the interesting objects, but unfortunately PyCharm simply cannot handle it I believe since the SimObjects are added dynamically to that namespace at startup in a very convoluted way via PyBind11 native modules + code generation.

A description of how this works in more detail can be found here, but basically every SimObject class goes through some heavy code autogeneration to make this work, say e.g. src/cpu/simple/AtomicSimpleCPU.py  due to SimObject('AtomicSimpleCPU.py') in src/cpu/simple/SConscript.

As of 2017, PyCharm said they did not have plans for a proper native C/C++ extension setup: https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206018984-Developing-Python-extension-in-C-using-PyCharm


With that said, I've found that it is not worth to use an IDE for the Python part of gem5. This is because the Python tends to be very simple to understand with IPDB (or impossible to setup an IDE for), and if you just grep stuff you tend to quickly guess what is going on. For C++ though I do recommend setting up Eclipse: How to setup Eclipse IDE for gem5 development?

This involves

Title: Implementing Atom with Python Language Server
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am new here. I am trying to setup the python IDE on Atom following the instruction offered by Atom.io.

https://atom.io/packages/ide-python

There is an instruction: 

"Depending on your Python setup pyls may be installed in a non default folder. In this case either add the directory to your PATH or edit the "Python Language Server Path" setting of ide-python to point to the pyls executable."

I stucked here.
What does it mean? How to add this to the PATH? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In my case it was failing because pyls didn't work with Python 2.7
Error

So I installed Python 3.6 and followed you note forcing 3.6

python3.6 -m pip install python-language-server[all]


That did the trick.  Thanks!

I had the same problem. My solution:


Run from terminal to install pyls: 



  pip install 'python-language-server[all]'



Print out details of WHERE the python language server was installed:



  pip show python-language-server


Which gave me the path:


  Location: /home/bad/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages


I browsed to that path and found the 'pyls' folder. Then I went into atom and edited the configuration to point at '/home/bad/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyls'.

Title: [PyCharm]: detach debugger from cosole
Description: 
    
    
                    
I run a python console in PyCharm and attach the debugger to it by clicking on the green debugger button in the left pane of the console window.

Debugging this way works great!

But there seems not to be an option to detach the debugger from the console.
When I change the code or stop the debugger by mistake I am not able to reattach it because the debugger button on the left pane is still pressed :(

Therefore I have to run a new python console, redoing all the stuff done before (importing modules, scripts etc.), attaching the debugger.

It would be nice to have an option to detach the debugger from a python console, change some code and reattach it.

Does anyone have any ideas on this issue?

Thanks in advance.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes, it is possible with some implications and somehow cumbersome user experience IMHO.

Once you initiated a debug session from the Python console in PyCharm you can detach the debugger from the debugger window but you won’t see the debugger window nor be able to focus it even using Alt+5 unless you hit some breakpoint that you have to somehow set.

Once you reach a breakpoint, and the debugger takes control, you can press the red × on the left panel of the debugger window.



Then you will be asked:



You can press the Disconnect button that will detach and terminate the debugger but the debugger button in your original console will remain pressed until you restart that console.

You’re welcome to request a feature for PyCharm and I will surely give it my vote.
    
    
Title: How do I ignore long lines in Sublime Text when searching
Description: 
    
    
                    
I often use the search feature in Sublime Text to search folders - some of these folders contain extremely long lines (1000's of chars long) due to minified code, base64 encoded data or certificates.

Search results often come back looking like the following (which is both annoying visually, as well as giving me accidental matches on shorter strings):



Is there a way I can omit lines greater than a certain length from my search results?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can achieve what you are after (to a degree) using negative look ahead and negative look behind syntax.

Just suppose you didn't want to include any lines over 50 characters long where you are searching word MATCH, the following regex would work (?&lt;!.{46})MATCH(?!.{46})

Scenarios (first 4 lines produce a match, the following 3 do not)

xxxxxxxxxxxxxMATCHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx50
MATCHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx50
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxMATCH
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxMATCHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx95

MATCHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx51
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxMATCH
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxMATCHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx96


In this example the longest line included in the returned result set will be of length 95 characters as there are 45 before and after the word MATCH. so not perfect but close, and for your purpose I'm sure it will do to exclude those super long lines of encoded data.

You can tune the length of the look behind and look ahead to get the result you are after.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using Dev C++ v5.6.1 IDE on Windows7. 

I have written a C code which has hundreds of line that are displayed as output on screen. 

The buffer size of Console Windows is small and I cannot view the initial printf statements. 
I tried it changing from "properties" option, but it didn't help.

Where Can I find the option to increase the console window buffer size.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As you're using Windows, a simple way you can do this is by changing the console window size with the batch command: mode con: cols=150 lines=50. cols adjusts width, lines adjusts height.You may choose to call this with system to set the console size. This is considered bad, more about that here.

// This is considered bad, you shouldn't use system calls.
system("mode con: cols=150 lines=50");




A safer way to do this, is changing the buffer and size using functions defined in &lt;windows.h&gt;.  
Here is a small example illustrating this:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    SMALL_RECT rect;
    COORD coord;
    coord.X = 150; // Defining our X and
    coord.Y = 50;  // Y size for buffer.

    rect.Top = 0;
    rect.Left = 0;
    rect.Bottom = coord.Y-1; // height for window
    rect.Right = coord.X-1;  // width for window

    HANDLE hwnd = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE); // get handle
    SetConsoleScreenBufferSize(hwnd, coord);       // set buffer size
    SetConsoleWindowInfo(hwnd, TRUE, &amp;rect);       // set window size

    printf("Resize window");

    return 0;
}


Keep in mind that the function SetConsoleWindowInfo fails if the specified window rectangle extends beyond the boundaries of the console screen buffer. More about that here.

I am new to Visual Studio 2013, having used 2010 in the past. How do I add a C file? There only seems to be an option for C++. I do not use C++, only C, and I compile to ANSI C99. This is what the dialog box looks like when I pick &quot;Add New Item&quot;:

Short answer: you can't.

Visual C++ is a C++ IDE backed by a C++ compiler.  It supports the common subset of C and C++ (because it is also valid C++), but does not directly support C.  It only partially supports C99.  So there is no way to add a file that will be compiled as C99 to a project.

Here is what that link says:

Using Microsoft Visual Studio for Simple C Programs

A free version of Microsoft Visual C++ Express is available in: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/express/aa700735.aspx

To edit your C program:

From the main menu select File -&gt; New -&gt; Project
In the New Project window:
Under Project types, select Win32 - Win32 Console Application
Name your project, and specify a location for your project directory
Click 'OK', then 'next'
In the Application Wizard:
Select Console application
Select Empty project
Deselect Precompiled header
Once the project has been created, in the window on the left hand side you should see three folders:
Header Files
Resource Files
Source Files
Right-click on Source Files and Select Add-&gt; New Item
Select Code, and give the file a name
The default here will be a file with a *.cpp extension (for a C++ file). After creating the file, save it as a *.c file.


To compile and run:

Press the green play button.
By default, you will be running in debug mode and it will run your code and bring up the command window.
To prevent the command window from closing as soon as the program finishes execution, add the following line to the end of your main function:
getchar();
This library function waits for any input key, and will therefore keep your console window open until a key is pressed.

Title: JavaScript on Netbeans Scarce Code Support Features
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have difficulties coding in JavaScript with Netbeans. I can't see beforehand:


my mistypes,
relations between classes, functions and variables (dependency, parents-children etc.), 
javadocs references (both original and imported for libraries).


THE PROBLEM is in:


heavy debugging because of primitive mistype and the use of irrelative substances;
time consuming browsing to find help for the context.


I TRIED:


Netbeans 7.4 (some basic Ctrl+Space lookup is supported, but very limited and usually useless);
Eclipse 3.8 (no context support);


These IDEs provide adjustable autoformatting and text mark-up (braces, clever tabs, text colors etc.) This is all very helpful, but insufficient. After having to migrate from Java to JavaScript for job routines, I now understand how much work had I automized and saved coding Java. I just feel I'm missing Ctrl+Space after a dot for Javadoc and Ctrl+LeftClick to navigate to declaration. It results in more time creating similar things in code.

THE QUESTION IS:


How to get JavaScript language docs for Netbeans?
How to make Netbeans show relations between classes, variables and functions so that I don't see what can't be done from this context? For JavaScipt like it does for Java?

I can't add comments because i haven't reputation enough...

I am a Java developer since Java version 1.1, and Netbeans's truly fan since version 5.5 (Eclipse? What's that thing?).

I am currently developing Javascript code in Netbeans 7.4. It offers code completion exactly as it does with Java (plus javadoc-style documentation popup, Ctrl-Space behavior, colouring code...), almost the same pros and cons as developing java, php or another language...

And yes, it saves a lot of time of searching for object's methods and properties, misspelling...

Maybe I don't know really what are you looking for, but in my opinion it is a good stuff. If you can debug an HTML5 webapp to such deep level...enough for me.

About the inline documentation in a javadoc-style, my NB shows a pretty nice one (bundled, i didn't plugged anything...). Of course, it could be more complete or functional... Take a look to this image:



Next I'll try webstorm... Good luck!

Ok, let's see how NB manages itself to show you a wonderful javadoc-style documentation popup of jQuery API...



It looks so good to me... I love it :)

I only added the developer version of jQuery (the one commented and uncompressed) to the src folder of my opened Java project... nothing more... I think this is some kind of magic... Maybe you can add your own commented .js libraries in the same way. Just explore the jQuery .js to learn how to comment your code.

I think, that you cannot expect the same level of tool support for Java (strongly typed, object oriented) and JavaScript (weakly typed, functional).
Compiler for strongly typed languages knows, what is allowed in given context, but in JavaScript is the situation drastically different. Everything is dynamic and you cannot tell what is mistype.

Anyway I think, that latest NetBeans 7.4 has really great support for JavaScript including code completion.

I think the best IDE for JavaScript would be the JetBrains WebStorm. 
The company has also made IntelliJ Idea IDE for Java, which is in my humble opinion the best one available. 
You can download free version here: http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ 

I'm using it a lot myself and I can really recommend it.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Steps below helped me to partly resolve the problem:


Changed project type from HTML5 to PHP to exclude libraries folders from code analysis as described here;
Configured at Tools - Options - Editor - Hints - Javascript to "Suggest for current line" instead of "Warning".
tune up and use correct tags for javadocs as described here;
Resolved proxy connection problems to make IDE see the Internet: Tools - Options - General;
updated Netbeans to 7.4 from 7.4RC1;


Now you have:
 - fast code completion popup window load,
 - docs texts, including pop-up code completion docs for your own comments,
 - can navigate to declarations from other files Ctrl+LeftClick,
 - have suggestions on errors,
 - type recognition failing if you mistype function or variable name to smth impossible.

Technically ng-* is not a valid HTML attribute per spec, so we show an error.  Luckily Angular allows you to define your attribute using data-ng-* attributes to make them valid:

It may be too much to ask, but is there an editor that would let me draw in the margins, a la MS Paint, as auxiliary comments, and maybe even to tack the picture to a particular line? Just in case such a thing exists, I would ideally like to use it alongside Vim.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Such an editor would have suffered the kind of feature creep that is against the philosophy of vim (or at least vi).  You're more likely to be happy with adding your own layer of indirection between vim and an external doodling app.  As @Mats Petersson suggests, a URL is one way.  Or a filename relative to some directory, or an XML tag.

A plugin for vim that recognizes your layer might automatically display your doodles.  If Clippy can be implemented as a vim plugin, surely so can this.

If ascii-art suffices, try the plugin DrawIt, http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=40 ;  or use that webpage's search box.
    
    
Title: How to improve IDEA performance?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I like IDEs from JetBrains most of other IDEs. I often use IDEA and PyCharm And while I work with them, I spend much time on waiting IDEA's different tasks.
So is there are any tips how to improve IDEA and PyCharm performance?

Configuring JVM options

I use 64 Bit Windows 7.

I go to : C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2.4\bin

Open idea64.exe.vmoptions using text editor, and change values of -Xmx and -Xms

This is my new idea64.exe.vmoptions config :

-Xms1024m
-Xmx2048m
-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=240m
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=50

-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
-Djdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=""
-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
-XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow


Description (Official): 

-Xmx    Limits the maximum memory heap size that the JVM can allocate for running IntelliJ IDEA. Default value depends on the platform. If you are experiencing slowdowns, you may want to increase this value, for example, to set the value to 2048 megabytes, change this option to -Xmx2048m.

-Xms    Specifies the initial memory allocated by the JVM for running IntelliJ IDEA. Default value depends on the platform. It is usually set to about half of the maximum allowed memory (-Xmx), for example, -Xms1024m.

That is all for now.

Title: Something to visual CSS structures and compare them
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am looking for a tool to help with some CSS editing, but I am not planning to use it in what seems to be the normal way.

I have a website that is getting a reskin, we already have the CSS files with the changes as it is already applied to a related website. 

What I ideally want, is an editor of some kind that will help me to visualize the structure or hierarchy of the old CSS and the new CSS so I can more easily find the classes that will cross over nicely, the classes that require tweaking, and the classes that will need to be created from scratch.

I'm not worried auto completion, or being able to view the changes instantly or anything like that, what i really want is just the easy way to view and traverse it.

Does anyone know of anything that can do this? Ideally free or open source, but all suggestions welcome.

Title: How can I make Class Completion include parentheses even for empty parameter lists?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm back in Delphi 2010 again after having worked several years in Visual Studio. I would like to make the IDE behave in a differnet way:

I'd like the IDE's auto-completion to respect the parenthesis when I declare a function/procedure. Example: if I declare procedure x(); Id like the auto-completion to create procedure myobj.x(); and NOT procedure myobject.x; as it does. Yes, it doesn't really matter but I'm pedantic. Any ideas?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Delphi doesn't require the parentheses when there are no parameters; I doubt this is possible. 

It shouldn't matter in the interface or implementation, where the fact that it's a method declaration is clear. 

function TMyClass.IsDefaultPropValue: Boolean;


I can see where it would matter in actual code that calls the method, where you would want to clarify that it was not a variable, as in 

// Unit MyClass
type
  TMyClass=class(TSomething)
  public
    function IsDefaultPropValue: Boolean;
  end;

// In a far distant block  of code in another unit that uses the above unit, using the
// nasty "with" (not you, of course - one of your coworkers):
with MyClassInstance do
begin
  // More lines of code. FirstPass is a local boolean variable.
  if FirstPass then
  begin
    if IsDefaultPropValue then
    begin
      // More lines of code
    end
    else
    begin
      // Alternate branch of code 
    end;
  end
  else
  begin
    if IsDefaultPropValue then
    //.....
  end;
end;


In this case, it's not clear that IsDefaultPropValue is a function and not a Boolean variable and I'd use it as 

if IsDefaultPropertyValue() then ... 

// or better yet: 
if MyClassInstance.IsDefaultPropValue() then ...


to make it clear.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
AFAIK, there's no way.  

Object Pascal doesn't require parenthesis when you have (as Ken said) no parameters - so it's harmless.

PS.: The need for parenthesis even for non-parameterized routines is one of the most pesky and irritant things in VS languages (particularly in VB.NET). Of course, it's just IMHO...

This Eclipse MinGW64 tutorial mentions:


  update (Nov 9, 2010): recent MinGW-w64 versions come with 'as', 'g++', and 'gcc' commands.  This step may be unnecessary in your MinGW build.


Meaning you won't have anymore to update the GCC assembler, C++ compiler, C compiler and C++ linker, with 'x86_64-w64-mingw32-as', 'x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++', 'x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc', and 'x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++'.

In spite of what other people are saying, Eclipse actually has very good support for C++, even in Windows: check out the CDT project. It's very mature and well-supported -- it works for C/C++ at least as well as Eclipse JDT works for Java.

As for the compiler itself, VonC is right, MinGW-w64 (but the mingw-w64 project is moving to mingw-w64.org so i suggest to use mingw-w64.org) is the best option. Eclipse CDT has built-in support for MinGW so as long as you install MinGW first, Eclipse should automatically detect it.

A 64-bit version of GCC for Windows is available at http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download. I can't see why you would want to use Eclipse for C or C++ programming - try the Code::Blocks IDE at http://www.codeblocks.org instead.

Honestly, I use cygwin. Its compatable with unix so you can easily move systems and has tons of functionality that is gcc friendly (autoconf, make, makedepends, ...). To use gcc to compile to 64 bit add the -m64 option. To compile for windows use the -mno-cygwin option. Make sure though that you're using gcc 3 and not 4 (then you'd use the mingw compiler series). Otherwise, its all the same as unix which is really useful.

There are two bugs with this event handler. To fix them, you can


remove the System. from TArray&lt;System.Byte&gt; (in the interface and implementation)
add IdSocketHandleto the uses list in the interface


I have not investigated further but after these changes the code can be compiled.

So the full code would like be

unit Unit12;

interface

uses
  Windows, Messages, SysUtils, Variants, Classes, Graphics, Controls, Forms,
  Dialogs, 
  IdSocketHandle, // &lt;-- added
  IdBaseComponent, IdComponent, IdUDPBase, IdUDPClient, IdUDPServer;

type
  TForm12 = class(TForm)
    IdUDPClient1: TIdUDPClient;
    IdUDPServer1: TIdUDPServer;
    procedure IdUDPServer1UDPRead(AThread: TIdUDPListenerThread;

This is a question about Netbeans. In the Tasks panel, can I select some similar errors and fix them all? I remember doing this in eclipse.

For example, I have a lot of warnings about not using String concatenation with a StringBuilder, and Netbeans is capable of fixing those errors replacing the String concatenations with calls to the StringBuilder.append() method.

Description: 
    
    
                    
We have a Nexus repository, that holds our software (surprise ...). In our IDEs, we added the repositories, so we can navigate them in a visual manner.

Problem: the IDE uses the .index folder (with it's gz file), which is currently updated every night.

What I want is: if anyone adds an artifact, the .index should be updated automatically. Is that possible?

What I don't want is: make the index update itself every so many minutes.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Exporting the index into the consumable binary and chunking out the indexes isn't a trivial process so it's not something we've setup to allow publishing every time a release or snapshot is published. It's also a waste because it's unlikely that consumers of the index are updating every n seconds. 

The internal indexes are however updated in realtime and searches against the Nexus UI will have the latest and greatest. We are working on more tightly integrating the IDE and Nexus internal indexes to eliminate the publish/consume loop.
    
    
Title: Netbeans Ruby on rails autocomplete does not work as expected
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using Netbeans v6.8 on Ubuntu 9.10 for Ruby on Rails development.

My problem is that autocomplete works very inconsistently. For example, when I hit ctrl+space after typing "File.", I get all the methods neatly defined at the top in bold that can be called on the class. This list is demarcated and followed by all the other hundreds of methods from classes/modules other than File.

But if I hit ctrl+space on some other clause such as "ActionController::Base::logger.", I don't see the methods such as 'info' or 'error' at the top. I just get the generic hundreds of method listed alphabetically (info and error are from the logger class are included in this list but they are interspersed with the rest of the methods and hence not discoverable unless you know what you are looking for).

I initially thought that codecomplete just works for Ruby classes and not Rails but this is not the case as I can get it to work for some Rails classes quite accurately and consistenly.

This is getting very frustrating. Can someone please suggest a solution?

If not, can anyone recommend a better (free) IDE that has a better code completion feature?

Not the answer you want on the 'ignore' front, but you can do a ctrl + delete should delete all the white space. If not contol + shift + left arrow to highligh then del will fix it.
