I'm not an expert on Python, but I do work as a web developer and use JavaScript regularly. For that side of things, probably the easiest way is to use Chrome/Firefox debugger tools. You can do this manually by finding the line of code in the console and clicking (F12-

I use PyCharm.  It's a heavyweight IDE, so expect more features than you probably want if you're just getting started.  It has a very good integrated debugger.  You'll be able to break into both your Python and Javascript.  Further, you'll see a pretty nice productivity jump with all the editing support like auto complete and intellisense.  My advice is to stick with print() and logging as long as you can. For me getting a firm grasp of packages, python environments, virtualenv, command line tricks and git all before committing to the PyCharm IDE helped me adopt it with more confidence I was getting the value of all the integration.

Title: Building and running a single .cpp file in Netbeans without having to create a project?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I was wondering if you can help me out. I've recently started using Netbeans to code in c++. After I installed the Cygwin compiler, I've found that in order to build and run c++ code one has to create a whole project.

Is there a way that I can only build and run ONE single .cpp file or is it necessary to make a whole project for only one file?

If that is the case, do you know about any other IDE's that can build and run a SINGLE .cpp file without having to create a project for one file? 

Thank you.
    

        
Title: Quickest way to check what project is loaded in VS2013
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a solution that exists in multiple branches and multiple workspaces in TFS. When editing them in Visual Studio, they all look very similar. It is not uncommon for me to have multiple versions of the solution open at the same time in separate instances of Visual Studio. Three or four is not uncommon when tracing changes between branches. It can get confusing to know which solution is which.

What is the quickest way to tell which specific solution (file path or branch and workspace) I have loaded in VS2013?

My current approach is to open a file and hover over its tab to see the file location, but when I am Alt-tabbing through multiple instances of VS, this is tedious.
    

        
Title: gedit - Is there a &ldquo;comment region&rdquo; option in gedit?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In some IDEs and editors,there are keyboard shortcuts to comment or uncomment a region of highlighted text.  Is it possible to do this in gedit?

I read the documentation and I think there's not...but figured it's worth checking SO
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There are a couple plugins that add this functionality. The obvious one is called Code Comment and is available in the gedit plugins package I believe, and then there is the line-tools plugin. Unfortunately, in either case while you can select multiple lines and comment them out it will only use line comments syntax not block comments. I keep a small collection of useful plugins here https://github.com/aeischeid/gedit3-bundle and Line-tools is included

It appears the Ubuntu Software Centre version I had installed was a version out of date. I got the new 8.0 version direct from NetBeans and it now works.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Although this is not the perfect solution, it's just a workaround. If it's a simple project you could erase the nbproject folder and create a new project with existing sources with that netbeans will re-create the project files.
    
    
Title: File save within IDE save to multiple file locations
Description: 
    
    
                    
Due to a source control folder structure that is out of my control I have found myself in a situation where I need to keep my source python files in three separate locations up-to-date at all times. I am looking for the cleanest solution to accomplish this without having to resort to hacking it together. 


I have all of my primary python source files and my Visual Studio 2012 Python Tools project files in a folder that is not published to the end user, but is managed via source control.
I have all of my python files updated into a separate folder that is published to the end users. Files contained in this folder are not ever executed, only used to publish into final builds.
I have a local folder that these python files will end up in if I download a published build. Unfortunately when executing the main application from the published build, this is the folder that the python files will be executed via.


Obviously this is a simplified explanation of the problem. However my goal is to cleanly be able to save a file while editing in Visual Studio 2012 Python Tools, and have it distribute to PublishFiles, and DestinationFiles. Very similar to how in any C++ project you would have an output directory. 

My first reaction to this question would be to not work in this fashion, unfortunately I do not have any control over this situation, only need to develop a solution to the problem.

Thanks!

Answer 1: 

    
    
Sorry to say that you have to drop your idea . Simply write them in Java using Eclipse. VS is not optimized for Java and Eclise has a larger ecosystem of useful plug-ins. Using VS for Android development is like designing a web-site with assembler: It is simply not made for that :). Eclipse is still best Ide for Android app development

Check out TypeScript and Phaser.io.  This will give you full intellisense (auto-complete) in Visual Studio. This is exactly what you desire and the workflow works well as I have been using it for over 6 months.

I have a working install of "gfortran" on "OS X 10.9". I am trying to work with "xcode 5.1.1", but the first experiences do not seem promising:
It recognizes that the code is F90 but the behavior of the editor seems stupid - it does not even indent the code when asked.

Is this because my project is badly configured (it surely is) or is "xcode 5" unable to help developing in Fortran anyway ? (I found answers on the web regarding older versions suggesting that it is not appropriate, but then why is "xcode 5" recognizing F77 and F90 ?)
If "xcode" is inappropriate, other "IDE" suggestions for "gfortran" on "OS X"?

Thanks
    

        
Title: Eclipse Error Logging - Not Showing Because of imported from GIT?

Answer 1: 

    
    
It depends on how you import your Java (Git managed) project into the Eclipse workspace.
See "Importing a GitHub project into Eclipse" as an example.

The key is for your Eclipse project to reference the sources in the git repo folder (kept outside the Eclipse workspace folder, in any place you want).

I begin to work with Emacs and decide to learn all its shortcuts. To execute a shell command there is a M-! shortcut. But I don't know how to press exclamation mark key.

The issue was fixed! The problem was with keyboard layout for language switching. In my KDE environment there was an Alt-Shift key for switching languages.
So if someone will encounter with this issue - please check your keyobard layout shortcuts: probably you have an Alt (meta) -Shift key for this. If so - change it to another.

As of April 2015, I had the same problem and the issue was the current incompatibility of Java 8, Eclipse Kepler (or Juno) and the current Force.com IDE. I had to (1) uninstall Java 8 completely; (2) re-install Eclipse Kepler--basically unzip the *.gz to a new folder; (3) find an archive download for Java 7 and install it; and (4) re-install the Force.com IDE.  This was the only series of steps that completely fixed the problem.  All components of custom objects are now available to me in the components tree.  My computer's OS is Windows 7 64-bit.

Description: 
    
    
                    
When I'm typing the value of an attribute and I hit space, it automatically jumps to the next attribute. I guess this makes sense when typing an id or something but it's really annoying when typing the class attribute with multiple classes. Does anyone know a way to change this behavior?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The behavior you describe is a function of the IntelliSense "auto list members" feature.  You can work around the annoyance by disabling "Auto list members" for HTML.  Note: you can also do this for other languages.

I use NuSphere's PhpED's PHP IDE to crate and debuge PHP script.

I've never used a repository systems, but wish to do so now, and am struggling on how to implement it into my workflow.

I have the following three machines:

Windows 7 PC


NuShere PhpED IDE (It is set up to use my Local Development Centos Server)
TortoiseGit
SourceTree (Not sure if I will use since it doesn't integrate with PhpED)

GitLab
Samba (not set up yet, but plan on using to share /var/www files with PhpED on Windows PC)

Will I need to install Git on the Windows PC?

Will I need to install Git on the Remote Production Centos Server?

Yes, if you want to git clone the repos from your Local Dev Centos server onto your computer


  
  Will I need to install Git on the Remote Production Centos Server?
  


Yes, if you want to push your repos to bares repos on your Remote Production Centos server.
But you can also consider other means to deploy those same repo:
A post-receive hook on the local Prod Centos server can:


checkout those repo (still on the local Prod server, where git is installed anyway), as described for instance in "Getting GitHub files (and updates) onto an Ubuntu web server",
rsynch that working tree to the prod server (that way, no need for Git on the remote prod server)

i've installed the tern-js plugin for sublime 3, however for some reason I cannot make its command work with sublime's key bindings (I'm a sublime nube btw) according to the documentation.. ternjs_jump_to_definition is supposed to be a valid command.

So i put this in the default (OSX).sublime-keymap file:

{ "keys": ["super+ctrl+j"], "command": "ternjs_jump_to_definition"},
{ "keys": ["super+ctrl+r"], "command": "ternjs_reload"},


I also put this.. still didn't work:

{ "keys": ["super+ctrl+j"], "command": "ternjs_jump_to_definition", "context":
    [
            { "key": "has_next_field", "operator": "equal", "operand": true }
    ]
}


any idea what's going on wrong? I know that tern-js is installed.. because typing Ctrl+Space for code completion actually works: 

any idea what I'm doing wrong? I simply want typing command+ctrl+j to jump to method definition.

Wow, this is an old question!  I just ran into this myself (Sublime Text version 2.0.2), and I tried "ctrl+right" as my key binding.  It didn't work. My guess was because it was in the Default/Default (OSX).sublime-keymap file.  So, I searched for some key sequences to use, and discovered "ctrl+z" was available, and tried that.

The following is what I added to User/Default (OSX).sublime-keymap file:

[
    { "keys": ["ctrl+z"], "command": "ternjs_jump_to_definition", "args": {"to": "line" } }
]


It only brought me to the top of the source file until I added the "args" parameter as shown. Now it takes me right to the function signature! The above is the entire contents of my User keymap settings, by the way.

I looked in my default keymap file, and I didn't find super+ctrl+j nor super+ctrl+r in the file, even with super and ctrl swapped, so I'm not sure what else I can suggest.

I've been using the Eclipse SuiteCloud IDE for months. Recently I've been getting timeouts and errors when simply trying to upload files to the SANDBOX environment (PRODUCTION seems better).

Any suggestions?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Try Brackets editor http://brackets.io/. It's a nice editor to code the web. Phonegap plugins also available for this editor. Just take a look at this editor. Make sure to download the version of Brackets with Phonegap Plugin compatibility.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
For the Cordova/Phonegap app I developed, I used cloud9. In my workflow, I would first get things working in my browser, then occasionally do builds with Adobe's Phonegap Build service to work out the kinks on my mobile devices.
The nice thing about c9 is you'll have a public URL for the website you're developing so you can preview it in your device's browser, which is typically closer to the environment you'll get with Phonegap.

The weinre debugging tool, although slow if you're running it through http://debug.phonegap.com/, can really help track down problems when debugging on mobile devices.
    
    
Title: Disable Admin Permissions Visual Studio 2012
Description: 
    
    
                    
So,

I have somehow made it so Visual Studio 2012 is starting with elevated permissions (UAC dialog / Admin mode). 

I did not do this by modifying my shortcut. Let me repeat, did not. 

I believe my registry has been modified to do this. I think I installed a plugin sometime ago that did this, but need to change it back, and do not remember if that is 100% correct. 

My Question: Does anyone know were this might be controlled in the registry (Win 8 64-bit)? Or if there is something else I am missing?

I have installed a lot of different plugins like I said, but the one that I can think controls this type of behavior is VSCommand2012. I have made sure that I have the option to force starting in admin mode turned off for this plugin. 

I looked here:
Registry permission for Visual Studio 2012, but the only answer is for Win 7 and VS 2010.

Thanks!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Well, I ended up removing the VSCommand2012 plugin, and then re-installing it. 

I then set the option to force starting in admin mode turned off for the plugin and it started working. That is, VS no longer start with elevated permissions.

The Problems Bookmarks and Tasks views all have a Sort By option that lets you sort by the file path which effectively arranges them by project.

Title: Erratic and inconsistent autocomplete in PHPStorm
Description: 
    
    
                    
My PHPStorm v 7 is behaving very erratically and inconsistently when it comes to autocompetion. 

For example, given a variable $test_variable which has been previously declared, if I attempt to quickly retype this variable by typing 'tes...', it sometimes does NOT auto suggest the variable $test_variable unless I include the dollar sign prefix (i.e. typing '$test...').

On other occasions, even if I don't include the dollar sign, it successfully suggests to autocomplete the variable. 

Why is this? Why is it behaving so inconsistently? Same thing happens with declared functions. Sometimes it produces the correct suggestion but other times it does not. Is this a bug with PHPStorm?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Agreed, since phpstorm7, it seems really odd. For example.

.test {
font-size: 10px !imp;


}

Then hitting tab with the cursor between the p and the semicolon will produce this mess:

.test {
font-size: 10px ! -webkit-animation-play-state : running;
-moz-animation-play-state: running;
-o-animation-play-state: running;
animation-play-state: running;;


}

Sorry I realise this is not an answer, but wanted to share your concern.
As for an answer, switch to PHPStorm 5. Seemed a lot more predictable.
