Title: How to delete all comment lines in IDEA?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I´m searching for a quick way to get rid of all comments in a file.

Looking for a keyboard shortcut or a quick and easy alternative.

Any suggestions?

EDIT

I would like particularly to delete only the out commented lines, so ones that start with //, not the block comments - which normally are meant for java-doc.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You could use Find &amp; Replace (Ctrl/Cmd+R).
Search In Comments Only (option under the little cog menu), enable regex search and search for string ^//.*. Replace with the empty string.

Select all lines you want comment/uncomment and use through menu

Title: PHPStorm: Disable Auto Opening of File transfer tool window
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using PHPStorm 10, every first save after the opening PHPStorm the File transfer tool windows show up, telling me that the file is being auto uploaded.

I've tried all type of settings, without good results: the file transfer window keep showing up at the first save. How can i disable this behavior?

This is the tool window:
File Transfer tool window
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Open Tools 
Answer 2: 

    
    
There is no such option in Settings/Preferences.

Just close the window (minimize it) and it will not show up again for this session (only notifications, which you can disable if so desired via Settings/Preferences | Appearance &amp; Behavior | Notifications -- look for "Web deployment" entries).
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If you change the View Mode to Undock and drag the inner edge of the File Transfer window outside the viewport, it will effectively be disabled. This is not very elegant and I hope JetBrains gives us a setting to disable this soon.

To see the File Transfer window again, right-click on File Transfer and select another view option such as Dock Pinned.

As of PHPStorm 2019.1.2. Thanks to Erenor's comment for the inspiration.

Edit: Ástþór's answer does work provided none of the transfers are throwing errors. Due to the way a server is set up on one of my projects, it always gives a benign error, which makes the File Transfer window pop up.
    
    
Title: What features are missing from Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Microsoft has recently announced the release of Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition, which they claim is a full featured IDE.

Indeed, they mention features like add-on support (eg. ReSharper) that were major feature gaps in Express Edition.

They are less clear about what features Community Edition does not have. There is a comparison of VS editions, but it does not appear to include Community Edition.

What features does Community Edition not have, that at least one other Visual Studio 2013 edition does?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Microsoft notes in the Community Edition FAQ:


  Visual Studio Community 2013 includes all the great functionality of Visual Studio Professional 2013, designed and optimized for individual developers, students, open source contributors, and small teams.


VS Professional is mentioned on the comparison. Compared to Ultimate, the following features are missing from Professional:


Debugging

IntelliTrace in Production
IntelliTrace (Historical Debugging)
IntelliTrace Performance Indicators
.NET Memory Dump Analysis
Code Map Debugger Integration
Performance and Diagnostics Hub does not include Tier Interaction Profiling

Title: How can I detect if &ldquo;Press any key to continue . . .&rdquo; will be displayed?
Description: 
    
    
                    
When running a console application in Visual Studio, depending on your settings, it will add a prompt after the program exits:


  Press any key to continue . . .


I have found how to detect if I am running under the debugger(use Debugger.IsAttached), but it isn't helpful. Press CTRL-F5 to Start Without Debugging sets this flag to false, yet still shows the prompt.

I want to detect this because I'd like to display my own message and wait for a keypress, but not double up keypress checks.

I don't want to muck with my general Visual Studio settings. If I can disable it for this project in a way that can be checked into source control, that would also work.

What mechanism is used to append this prompt, and how do I detect it?

Or how do I disable it per-project, and check this change into source control?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Add the following code to the console application: 

public static class Extensions {
    [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
    static extern IntPtr OpenThread(uint dwDesiredAccess, bool bInheritHandle, uint dwThreadId);

    [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
    static extern bool TerminateThread(IntPtr hThread, uint dwExitCode);

    public static Process GetParentProcess(this Process x) {
        return (
            from it in (new ManagementObjectSearcher("root\\CIMV2", "select * from Win32_Process")).Get().Cast&lt;ManagementObject&gt;()
            where (uint)it["ProcessId"]==x.Id
            select Process.GetProcessById((int)(uint)it["ParentProcessId"])
            ).First();
    }

    public static IEnumerable&lt;Process&gt; GetChildProcesses(this Process x) {
        return (
            from it in (new ManagementObjectSearcher("root\\CIMV2", "select * from Win32_Process")).Get().Cast&lt;ManagementObject&gt;()
            where (uint)it["ParentProcessId"]==x.Id
            select Process.GetProcessById((int)(uint)it["ProcessId"])
            );
    }

    public static void Abort(this ProcessThread x) {
        TerminateThread(OpenThread(1, false, (uint)x.Id), 1);
    }
}


And then modify your code like this: 

class Program {
    static void Main(String[] args) {
        // ... (your code might goes here)

        try {
            Process.GetCurrentProcess().GetParentProcess().Threads.Cast&lt;ProcessThread&gt;().Single().Abort();
        }
        catch(InvalidOperationException) {
        }

        Console.Write("Press ONLY key to continue . . . ");
        Console.ReadKey(true);
    }
}


So, everything we are expecting is done now. I consider this as a workaround solution. It works under Windows XP SP3 and I guess that it would work with newer Windows operating systems. Under Visual Studio, applications are always a spawned process. In older Visual C++ 6.0, it spawned by the IDE by calling VCSPAWN.EXE; in Visual Studio 2010, your application runs with following command line when Start Without Debugging: 


  "%comspec%" /c ""your application filename"  &amp; pause"


So it is impossible to reach the goal in fully managed ways; because it was NOT under the application domain. 

Here we use the managed way of WMI to enumerate the processes, and encapsulate the unmanaged WINAPIs to terminate the ProcessThreads, because the ProcessThread is not supposed to be normally aborted; it's provided like something for read-only. 

As mentioned above, the application was spawned with the particular command line; it would have a single thread creates a single process signature, so we used the Single() method to retrieve that thread and terminate it. 

When we start the application under an existing command prompt, it is just the same scenario of Start Without Debugging. Moreover, when Start Debugging, the application process is created by devenv.exe. It has a lot of threads, we known that and won't abort any thread, just prompt and wait for a key press. This situation is similar to starting application with double-clicking or from context menu. This way, the application process is created by the system shell, usually Explorer.exe and it also has a lots of threads. 

In fact, if we can successfully abort the thread it implies that we have the permissions to kill the parent process. But we do NOT need to. We just need to abort the only thread, the process terminates automatically by system when it has no more threads. Killing the parent process by identifying that the calling process is %comspec%, is another way to do the same thing, but it's a dangerous procedure. Because the process spawning the application might have other threads which have any number of threads create a process matches %comspec%. You may kill a critical work of process with carelessness or just growing the complexity of checking whether the process is safe to kill. So I consider a single thread creates a single process as a signature of our parent process which is safe to kill/abort. 

WMI is modern, some of WINAPIs might become deprecated in the future. But the real reason of this composition is for its simplicity. The old Tool Help Library is such complicated like the ways to convert ProcessThread to System.Threading.Thread. With LINQ and extension methods, we can make the code simpler and more semantical. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Sounds like this prompt is provided by the pause command.  This command is automatically added by Visual Studio.

When you run your project outside of Visual Studio, there is no reason to "detect" this command.  You can safely assume that it will not be added to your program.  This means you can go ahead and add whatever prompt you want, similar to:

Console.WriteLine("Press any key...");
Console.Read();


See this question.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Here is a piece of code that should do it:

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // do your stuff

        if (!WasStartedWithPause())
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue . . . ");
            Console.ReadKey(true);
        }
    }
}

public static bool WasStartedWithPause()
{
    // Here, I reuse my answer at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/394816/how-to-get-parent-process-in-net-in-managed-way
    Process parentProcess = ParentProcessUtilities.GetParentProcess();

    // are we started by cmd.exe ?
    if (string.Compare(parentProcess.MainModule.ModuleName, "cmd.exe", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) != 0)
        return false;

    // get cmd.exe command line
    string cmdLine = GetProcessCommandLine(parentProcess);

    // was it started with a pause?
    return cmdLine != null &amp; cmdLine.EndsWith("&amp; pause\"");
}

public static string GetProcessCommandLine(Process process)
{
    if (process == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException("process");

    // use WMI to query command line
    ManagementObjectCollection moc = new ManagementObjectSearcher("SELECT CommandLine FROM Win32_Process WHERE ProcessId=" + process.Id).Get();
    foreach (ManagementObject mo in moc)
    {
        return (string)mo.Properties["CommandLine"].Value;
    }
    return null;
}

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
That message has nothing to do with your program. You can add to your program anything you like and it will perform in the same way as it would, if you were to run it from the command prompt.

Visual studio displays it for the purpose of showing you that its execution has finished running, so you know it ended correctly. If you wish to skip it you could try to "run without debugging" (or something like that; it's just below "run with debugger").
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
This is the output of "pause" command which is added by visual studio. If you see this, the program is ended. Which comes to a question like is it possible for an application to detect that it self is ended. I think this is not logical.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
This prompt is given when the command
          system("pause") 

is used.

Even I faced this problem. You can either use the function _getch() under conio.h for waiting for key press. 

So you can use the following code:

      cout&lt;&lt;"your message here"
      _getch()


This would wait for the key press and display your own prompt. 
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Won't help to detect, but will add the same prompt when you run with debugger attached (F5) if you add this to the end of Main:

if (Debugger.IsAttached)
{
    Console.Write("Press any key to continue . . . ");
    Console.ReadKey();
}


It will in practice do the same as Ctrl + F5 does with &amp; pause 
    
    
Title: Python type inference for autocompletion
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is it possible to use Ocaml/Haskell algorithm of type inference to suggest better autocompletions for Python?

The idea is to propose autocompletion for example in the following cases:

class A:
  def m1(self):
    pass
  def m2(self):
    pass

a = A()
a.     &lt;--- suggest here 'm1' and 'm2'
fun1(a)

def fun1(b):
  b.   &lt;--- suggest here 'm1' and 'm2'


Are there any good starting points?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Excellent discussion, with many pointers, here (a bit dated). I don't believe any "production" editors aggressively try type-inferencing for autocomplete purposes (but I haven't used e.g. wingware's in a while, so maybe they do now).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You could have a look at ECompletion and OCompletion in Pharo Smalltalk. The compromises will probably different for python, but educated guesses with some conservative type inference work in practice. It also depends if you want completion to replace browsing the code/documentation, or to assist typing and to avoid typos.

I think in Pharo, if the message is an explicit send to a class (SomeClass m) then of course it will propose all messages in that class and its superclasses. Else, it just guesses all methods names in the system that match the typed prefix, and that works well. OCompletion adds a bit of heuristic prioritization based on editing history.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
A proper treatment would require a type system for Python, which would be (is?) an interesting research problem.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
The first case is "easy", and I bet JetBrains' PyCharm can do that. I've not used PyCharm, but I do use IDEA, also by JetBrains, for Groovy-based development (a dynamic language), and it has very good, very aggressive auto-completion. The second case would be more difficult, you want the IDE to infer the type of fun1 based on its use. In a language without generics, this may be reasonable. However, in F# / VS2010 at least (which likely would be similar to OCaml/Haskell here), the compiler / IntelliSense infer fun1 to have the signature 'a -&gt; 'a (that is, a function which takes a generic type 'a and returns a generic type 'a) so IntelliSense is very slim.
    
    
Title: How can I run just the currently selected lines in Spyder 4?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In previous versions of Spyder, you can select lines in the editor, and only run the selected lines. In Spyder 4, when you select lines and press Ctrl+Enter it executes runcell(0, '/your/dir/file.py') which executes the whole code. 

How can I run just the lines which I have selected?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The hotkey for running a the line at which the cursor is, or the currently selected lines in Spyder 4 is F9. Ctrl+Enter will run the current cell. You can read more about cells in Spyder here. Basically, these are blocks of code that can be defined in the editor using a specific syntax within the code, and can be run independently by Spyder and other IDEs.

Incidentally, Ctrl+Enter is the keyboard shortcut for running the current line in R Studio, not Spyder, which may be where you got it confused.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
In Spyder 4.0.1, the keyboard shortcut for 'run cell' is set to Ctrl+Return but for 'run selection' it is set to F9. You can use F9 to run a selection or if you prefer to use Ctrl+Return, you can go to Tools -
Answer 3: 

    
    
In Spyder 4 the keyboard shortcut to run the highlighted lines of code is F9. and if you want to use any other shortcut then you can change it from TOOLS
Title: Equivalent of the Scala IDE worksheet in other languages?
Description: 
    
    
                    

  A worksheet is a Scala file that is evaluated on save, and the result of each expression is shown in a column to the right of your program. Worksheets are like a REPL session on steroids, and enjoy 1st class editor support: completion, hyperlinking, interactive errors-as-you-type, auto-format, etc. (source https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-worksheet/wiki/Getting-Started)


Is there anything similar in any other language? I mean, I know about REPL in other dynamic languages, but what the worksheet does s much more.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is not really a language feature, more an IDE feature.

It looks like a pretty straightforward clone of the Transcript window which has been a standard part of Smalltalk IDEs since at the least the 1980s.

One of those Smalltalk IDEs is IBM VisualAge for Smalltalk (where it was called Scrapbook), which later became IBM VisualAge for Java, which became IBM VisualAge for Java Micro Edition, which became Eclipse, and in fact the Eclipse Java Development Tools still have that feature today.

Lisp and Forth IDEs also usually have something similar, often called a listener.

LINQPad is a product which provides a similar experience for C#, VisualBasic.NET and F#.

Pry is still in its infancy, but its goal is to morph into a full interactive IDE for Ruby.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
IPython does something very similar for Python with its web-based worksheets feature.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
F# has this feature as well. You can write F# statements in an F# script and then evaluate in the console. You can also reference F# source files or compiled binaries.

Currently, NetBeans support for Django is limited. The last posting that I could find, from 1 January 2010 and says that Django support is coming in NetBeans 7.0. I wouldn't be surprised if a few Python improvements in support of this make it into 6.10 due out in August 2010, but 7.0, due for 2010Q4 or 2011Q1, should have some Django support. If it's half as good as Ruby on Rails support, it'll be slick.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Netbeans doesn't have a django plugin that I know of. Eclipse's pydev plugin is decent, I typically use any ol' editor and bpython.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using Selenium IDE for the first and has no knowledge of automation scripting. So far i am able to manage using IDE but one issue is I am not able to select a value from drop down list randomly rather entering the index or label values manually every time. 

Can anyone please help me with this. 

Thank You
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I tried the below and it worked

Command: Select

Target : element Locator eg : id = card

Value : index=1
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Use command select(selectLocator, optionLocator), 'selectLocator' is the Id of the drop down from which the value is being selected and the 'optionLocator' is the value being selected.

For eg: say a drop down having Id="//select[@id='type'" with values like 'TypeA, TypeB, TypeC,...'. If you are selecting 'TypeA' from the drop down, your command should go like this:

selenium.select("//select[@id='type']", "label=TypeA");


I hope this will solve your problem.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
General approach is firstly click on the element and then select value from the element.

For Clicking : 
1.Command : click
2.target  : element locator like xpath/id/class of the element eg. xpath=xpath of the element

For Selecting value: 
1.Command : select
2.target  : same element locator used for clicking
3.Value   : Visible text you want to select / Index  (You will get it by inspecting that element)
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
First get the total number of items in the dropdown. Use getSelectOptions to get an array of options of the select box. Then generate a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the array (exclusive. Then use select with an index locator to select the randomly chosen option.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Use 
Command: KeyDown
Target:css=input.comboboxname

then use \13 to make selection in value.(put value for command and Target same.)

Title: Setting a &ldquo;build directory&rdquo; in vim?

Is there a way to tell vim to run the makeprg in a specific directory? I use per-project .vimrc files, and they would seem the perfect place to inform vim of where each project should be built, regardless of the current directory.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
 :let &amp;makeprg='(cd /tmp &amp;&amp; make)'

seems to work nicely for me
 :se makepgr=&quot;(cd %:h/.. &amp;&amp; make)&quot; 

to make it go to the parent directory

Note
The above worked on windows when I tried it; Today on linux I found out that I somehow had to use the following incantations to get the same to work:
:let &amp;makeprg='(cd %:h/.. &amp;&amp; make)'



Note I'm assuming you don't actually use make, because that would be a simple :make -C /tmp away
Note most other automated build systems have a similar option, e.g. :!scons -C /tmp

    
    
Title: Dumb completion in Visual Studio
Description: 
    
    
                    
Intellisense is nice for what it does, but often I find myself longing for the "crude" text completion of editors like Vim. I can't seem to find a facility for being able to complete a word--perhaps in a string, anywhere really--and have VS try to complete it for me (based on stuff I've typed before in the current buffer, or in all open files, or however it wants to work).

Am I missing something? (Or if necessary, is there an extension to do this?) It seems like it would actually be tons easier to implement than Intellisense, but it really can save typing.

Thanks!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You may want to look at the VisualAssist add-in. Its autocomplete is aware of the things you typed recently, so it selects the most recent match by default. It also works in more places than the standard IntelliSense (e.g. include paths).

A word of warning however, when you start using it, it's hard to go back...
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Take a look at ViEmu, Vi/vim emulation for Visual Studio, Word, Outlook and SQL Server. If it still doesn't fulfill your needs, attempt at rolling your own. Check out the Visual Studio Extensibility Reference and this tutorial to help you get started on VS Add-Ins.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
As stated in other answers, Intellisense in Visual Studio 2010 has become much better. Not only the extensibility, but also implementation.

It now filters the list of members containing the typed name anywhere within them. This also works with classes and types, so you don't have to remember the full type or class name. And last be not least, you can filter the list using the Pascal Case naming pattern. This means less typing and less mistyping.

More information on the Intellisense improvements in VS2010 can be found on ScottGu's blog.

Answer 5: 

    
    
In VS2010 implementing intellisense is extremely easy - assuming that you have a ready answer for 2 questions:


What should trigger the dialog
What is the list of possible completions for the current word.


In my custom editor I spent 90% of time on making the NDjango parser give to me what I need and only 10% on actually "implementing" intellisense

Edit

The project s open source feel free to download the code and play with it.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
The extensibility model in 2010 is much simpler but is (obviously) still a moving target.

It should be possible to get something simple using the intellisense part of this
 to supply an ICompletionSource which merges in whatever values you want to supply along with the existing implementations results.

Monitoring the current buffer for names should involve some playing around with the ITextView and ITextBuffer.

There is an example of modifying the presentation layer on codeplex but you should be able to use that as a base on which to try altering the data side of things.

Resharper from Jetbrains also has completion that is very intelligent.  CTRL+SHFIT+Space activates their "intelligent" code completion (beyond your normal CTRL+Space results), which is type and context-sensitive.  I frequently find it is choosing appropriate names for me.

Using the project files stored on a remote server option, I have to choose the WordPress root as the directory and download all the core files if I want to get the full benefit from the IDE.
Is there a way to include the WordPress code base as an external library that loads by default in all projects?  The feature is available for javascript libraries but I have gone through all the settings and can't find any way to add WordPress in less it's in the root of my project.

In visual studio, I could just press ctrl+spacekey and the methods appeared. In Geany is there a way for me to get this functionality?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
No, because is Python is dynamically typed language and quite hard to achieve that. Python plugins for netbeans do that partially, but I believe such plugin is not in geany developers plans. There are different things to be done ;-)

However, geany provides some completions support. First, it analyzes your imports in a file and uses it in completions; furthermore it completes functions from the std library. It also analyzes all you open files for suggestions, although you may need to apply it in preferences. Also you can get call tips, when you hit Ctrl+Shift+Space, which not everyone know about. They are quite good, because they appear in form &lt;Class&gt;.&lt;method&gt;(&lt;args&gt;), which is very helpful.

shortcut ctrl+space works for me. also, you can setup autocomplete suggestion length  (ie how many letters you must type before the autocomplete tooltip pops up automatically - http://www.geany.org/manual/current/#editor-completions-preferences ).

this works only for method names. if i want to see the options for method parameters, i must type bracket ( after the method full name.

I would love to program in python using only QtCreator. I have already used QtCreator to teach GUI programming to undergraduate students and they loved it.

I think it all depends on how you treat Qt Creator while you are developing Qt programs. There are lots of cool stuff in Qt Creator but if we focus on 2 major parts: Code Editor &amp; UI Designer, the situation is much easier to realize.

I want to write a program to link with binaries already created with VC++.  What are the steps to add a toolchain for VC++ in Eclipse?  Has anyone tried it successfully?  If so, does the debugger still work?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There is a toolchain implementation for VC++. The build plugin is called org.eclipse.cdt.msw.build, and there is a set of debugger plugins called org.eclipse.cdt.msw.debug.*. I think the build integration works, but the debugger integration still needs some work before it is usable.

Doug Schaefer on the CDT team has blogged about this several times, and has been running the Wascana project for some time to this end. Unfortunately, he's no longer working actively on Wascana.

If you wanted to put in some effort in bringing the VC++ toolchain and debug support closer to working condition, it would be very appreciated. I know that there are many people who would like to have that (myself included).

I am using Eclipse 3.6.1 classic and trying to tweak the color syntax to my desire. The one thing I haven't been able to change is the background color for the line number column. If this is not possible because Eclipse doesn't have an option for it, I will be satisfied even with a hack/plugin if any of you know of any. 

Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There is not an explicit setting for changing the background color of the line number column (Eclipse Helios, SR2, Build id: 20110218-0911). However, there are work-arounds and here is one:

The line number background changes color according to any changes you make in the Text Editors "Background color" - so the two are the same. Between these two is the column holding the debugging breakpoints (not sure what that column is called) and it's background color is not affected when changing the general background.

I run Eclipse on Linux (Oracle's version) and access it with XMing X-server from a PC. Setting this background color to a very pale yellow makes the narrow column holding the debugging breakpoints standout - and that column is between the text and the line number column. So the effect is to make the boundaries of the line number column more clear. 
The very pale yellow is #FCFFC8 = RGB 252,255,200 = HSV 63,22,100

Eclipse often behaves a little differently when I run it straight from my PC so this behavior may be one of those cases.

Hope this helps.
    
    
Title: How can I bind a specific key to different launch configurations in Eclipse?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have several launch configurations for the code I work on.

One configuration (#1) means "run the unit tests for the file in the frontmost editor (i.e. selected resource)".  I would really like to be able to always make this be bound to a key.

Another configuration (#2) means "run the server that I am working on (in the frontmost project) so I can test it interactively".

Yet another (#3) means "run some automated acceptance tests against the server".

I always want to have #1 close at hand, easy to run from a single keystroke.  Plus, I want to be able to run #2, watch it start up in a console, and when it's ready (since it's not entirely trivial to automate this) hit the key for #3.

This is possibly similar to the question for binding a key to a specific build configuration, but the answers there look very specific to builds, and as I'm using PyDev, I don't have a "build" step at all.

Also, given that I'm using PyDev, an answer in the form of a pyedit_* script would be appreciated just as much as a "native" answer for eclipse.
    

        
Answer 1:

Not to a specific launch Configuration , but you can bind a key to run Last run Configuration , 

Windows-&gt;preferences-&gt;General-&gt;Keys-&gt;Run last launched external Tool

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You can do the following (for #2 and #3), after having those run configurations created:

Go to Run &gt; Run Configuration &gt; Select the run configuration you want &gt; Common &gt; Display in Favorites Menu &gt; Check Run/Debug. This will make it always appear as the first on the menu.

This will make it appear in the menu in Run &gt; History and Run &gt; Debug History, then, you can access it through Alt+R, T, 1 (and 2 and 3) to run your configurations or Alt+R, H, 1 (and 2 and 3) to debug.

And for #1, as Piotr Dobrogost said, you can just use Ctrl+F9 in the current editor and choose which test-cases you want to run (if you select a unit-test -- usually with Ctrl+Shift+Up or Ctrl+Shift+Down -- it'll be pre-selected for you) -- then, if you configured to always relaunch the last launch, as explained in http://www.pydev.org/manual_101_run.html, you can use Ctrl+F11 to relaunch the last launch.
    
    
Title: CLion code navigation with C++ doesn&#39;t work
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've used AppCode (Intellij C++/ObjC IDE that replaces Xcode) for a while and really gotten used to being able to Ctrl+Click on any identifier to get to its definition/decleration.  

Now on a new work place, I'm using CLion for a somewhat larger code base and Ctrl+Click hardly ever works. It only seem to work when the identifier is in the same file.

Is there anything I need to setup for this to work correctly? CLion seem to index the code successfully and doing text searches works fine.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You need to use import project functionality of CLion from File -&gt; Import Project and give ok for CMakeLists.txt file automatic creation. Never mind the file is for CMake, you can build your project with other tools too, but CLion uses it for the dependencies.

Then append in the beginning of that file a line stating:

include_directories(.)


After that go to File -&gt; Settings and there search for Keymap from the left and after that on right, right below the word "keymap" there is a selection element for taking for example Eclipse default keymapping in use and there you have at least (I tested only it) the ctrl + click functionality working like charm!!

kudos about the include_directories(.) goes to this question: CLion indexer does not resolve some includes in the project directory
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I just looked at one of my more complicated teaching examples with multiple header/source files where this would come up. 

What I see is that ctl-click (and the red/green arrows in the gutter) does work only in the same file. But I can right-click on a method from another file and choose to go to either the declaration (in header) or definition (in cpp). 

The hotkeys to do this are not ctl-click. But you can remap hotkeys in IntelliJ ides, so you may be able to come up with hotkey combinations that don't seem too awkward to you.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You  need to  press ctrl + alt + shift + n.

And after pressing it a dialog box will appear to enter your variable/function name and click enter.
Tip: Filter the result for a better experience. Filter option is present on right side of the dialog box.


To get a quick peek of function/variable definition press ctrl + q while focusing on the variable or function.


To get the detailed or full definition of function press ctrl + shift + i while focusing on the variable or function.

When you change interpreter in pycharm , pycharm first update all of the pre-installed packages. Because time to time many changes comes in packages, Pycharm take care of them.

Pycharm is NOT updating the remote interpreter. See this discussion on the jetbrains feedback site. 

In short, the message is badly worded - what's actually happening is downloading remote libraries, which are used for pydoc, method signatures, looking at library code etc...

Title: Which IDE are CLISP Programmers using?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I noticed how SLIME (lisp development package for Emacs) does not come with a frame-source-location function for CLISP, so you can't automagically jump to a source location when inside the debugger. Given that, I figured CLISP users must be using some other IDE (though I guess IDE is a little bit misleading here, maybe they're just using a different Emacs package).

I have nothing for IDE with intellisense for EmberJS, but Sublime is usually the go-to program of choice for development in Javascript. With a few packages and a jslinter you can get cracking straight away.

In the editor, there are things called 'snippets' that allow you to type a key combination, and a large portion of the code will be instantly filled out for you. For instance this repo has a set that you can add to your Sublime application to help you get going. Apart from that, there's nothing really that can help you code faster and easier as having an automatic Jslinter (or jshinter depending on how much you hate Crockford) and a nice set of snippets.

I recently bought the latest version of Intellij idea (during their 75% off offer) which is really great by the way.

I have a problem though : the scala support seems to be broken. I have installed the scala support plugin with the SBT plugin. I have also installed the Play!2 framework support plugin but as soon as I open a scala file from within the IDE, it consumes almost 300% of my cpu resources and I can't figure out how to solve this issue.

Answer 2: 

    
    
I don't think this has anything to do with intelliJ, but rather Play! and Java. 

I have idea 12 with play 2.0 plugin. I open the play project in IntelliJ and using the top command I see that java is consuming roughly 3-5% of CPU. If I build the project, that jumps up to 150-300% of CPU and then comes back down after the compiling is done.

Running the same project from the play console, it jumps to about 100% when I first open it, and then if I run clean and then compile, it jumps to 323% and then comes back down.

You may be able to improve performance by doing compilation from the play console instead of IntelliJ. Just run clean, then compile, then within IntelliJ you should syncronize the project (alt-ctl-i).

Also, wondering if the version of the jvm has something to do with it. Are you using the sun version or an open source one. IntelliJ recommends using the sun version.

here's my specs:

Idea 123.94, Scala plugin version 0.7.62, Play 2.0 Support 0.2.6,
Play 2.0.4, Scala 2.9.1

Not exactly what you are asking for, but have you looked at Eclipse Mylyn? I think it will solve the underlying problem you have. With Mylyn you define a set of tasks and the editor will remember what tabs you had open for each task. As you switch between the different tasks, the context will be remembered.

I've used it on some projects and if you often switch between different jobs (i.e different defects) it is really helpful. Especially when you need to go back to a six month old task/defect. The problem usually is that you need a task repository, either connect to an existing one such as bugzilla, or create a local one. 

I'd say it's one of those Eclipse plugins that have the potential to drastically improve work efficiency. 
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
In Eclipse Juno, you can make the tabs somewhat smaller by changing the font size of the tabs themselves. Browse to this folder:

ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclipse.platform_4.2.0.v201206081400/css/

Then open the css file that is appropriate for your platform. On Mac OS X, this file is called "e4_default_mac.css". Then edit the following css rule:

.MPartStack {
    font-size: 9;
    font-family: "Droid Sans";
    swt-tab-renderer: null;
    swt-simple: false;
    swt-mru-visible: false;
    swt-tab-height: 22px;
}


Restart Eclipse. You will now be able to see more file tabs before they are clipped.

Title: Do you think VS and Intellisense make us dumber?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I read this article, the parts of "Intellisense" and "Generated Code":


  http://www.charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html


Do you think the Author's is right?

I don't agree that Intellisense is soooo bad for programmers. VS for C# uses to "hide" the controls' events in another file, but you can find them if you know enough about the language and you can modify them by hand. And with VS I don't need to memorize all the .Net classes I use. 
I think it doesn't matter if you use an IDE or notepad but, if thsese RAD tools exist and are free... Why not to use them?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
No I very much disagree with this point.  

Yes, I do agree that intellisense allows me to keep less of an objects growing number of members in my head.  I am dumber in the sense that I often know less about the intricate details of projects where I use intellisense heavily.  

For instance, I can probably rattle off  all of the members of the C++ types I use with great accuracy.  I tend to be a VIM only guy for my C++ projects and hence don't really use intellisnsee.  In C# and VB.Net projects though I couldn't rattle off the members with the same accuracy as I rely on intellisense more often.  

But there is a trade off.  Keeping all of the members in my head comes with a cost.  When writing code, instead of focusing on the algorithm, I focus on the members.  I have to constantly think about the naming convention of a particular type, or the parameter list, what's byref or by val, when writing out an algorithm in C++.   In C#/VB.Net I'm more free to think about the algorithm as the IDE takes care of finding the members for me.

Does this mean I'm dumber?  No it simply means I'm able to focus on the problem I'm actually trying to solve. I feel this makes me more productive and hence smarter not dumber.

No, modern programming tools and languages help the programmer focus less on the little things and more on the big picture.

Our physics prof always said why memorize something you can look up. He always listed the required formulas on the board during exams. Seems to be intellisense is the same idea. Rather than remembering if the object uses a Count or a Length property, let VS tell me.

Answer 7: 

    
    
I use intellisense and generated code to speed up development, not because I don't know what I'm doing.  Therefore, I can't agree that using them makes you dumber.

I am the kind of person that will try to learn as much about a language as possible before attempting to use the tools that facilitate development in that language.  In that regard, I have to agree with Matthew Jones' comment that "tools do not make people dumber...laziness and lack of drive do."

Programming is just moving forward to make life easier for the programmer and making him more productive.

Answer 9: 

    
    
I don't think so.

Intellisense makes things like case sensitive spelling easier.

Is it MyArray.Count() or MyArray.Size() or Length(MyArray) ... ? Which return type is a particular method, again? Intellisense saves me a few minutes every day on Google for things like this.

Detail memmorization is not the most important skill in software development.  It is better to have problem solving skills and the ability to find the information you need.

Answer 11: 

    
    
The question is of course....does Intellisense make programming less of a skilled profession?
    
    
Answer 12: 

    
    
Yes, I agree with the author. Intellisense (and many other Visual Studio features) is indeed "making us dumber" for the reasons mentioned in the article.

That's not always a bad thing. Sometimes it's more desirable to be productive than it is to get smarter. The challenge is striking the right balance. :)
    
    
Answer 13: 

    
    
The only qualm with IntelliSense that the author seems to have is the autocomplete when you press the space bar, which apparently he doesn't realize you can turn off in the Options menu.

Although, he claims that coding "has become a constant dialog with IntelliSense"... which makes no sense because you still have to pick the correct methods from the list! Without it, you'd simply have to search online for the name of the method instead of an instantaneous search.

It's interesting how the author ignores that IntelliSense can't tell you whether to use a StringBuilder or a String, etc.
    
    
Answer 14: 

    
    
Not at all.  When the intellisense list pops up, does a programmer search through the whole list every time to find the function they were looking for?  Maybe at first, but normally you keep typing until intellisense narrows down the list to the point where it's faster to use the up/down arrows and tab to complete.

Without intellisense, it would take a little longer to code given that you are experienced with the classes that you're using and a lot longer given that you aren't.  It only serves as a speed tool and quick documentation of everything that's available.
    
    
Answer 15: 

    
    
It doesn't make us dumber; it is a necessity. 

Back in the day (MS BASIC for me), there was no need for intellisense.  The scope of the language was limited enough for a programmer to remember all keywords and functions.  

Jump to today, intellisense is an absolute requirement.  Take .Net for example.  There is simply no way to remember or discover the many thousands of types, properties and methods.  Oh sure, for a very small project you may know a bunch (100s?) of items.   But let's be honest - there is no way a modern working programmer could exist without it.
    
    
Answer 16: 

    
    
Adding my two cents here.

From my own experience and as mentioned in the TFA I would say that the only drawback I've encountered so far is when you learn the language you might pick up bad habits. Using ArrayLists instead of List only because you're not aware of changing use clauses enables might give you some other datatype.

The author complains over that he gets the wrong datatypes when entering certain datatypes. While some of you will probably get a license, a weapon and start the man hunt, I've found that using naming conventions is an excellent way of forcing the intellisense to be working my way, especially when working in GUI-Control intensive forms &amp; stuff. 
    
    
Answer 17: 

    
    
No more so than calculators made for poorer mathematicians and physicists. Sure, using a slide rule forces you to keep a mental model of the order of magnitude of things, but it is really just a tool ... and better tools let you do better work.
    
    
Answer 18: 

    
    
This can be abstracted into the traditional question:

Does knowing more about the details help or hurt?

As a rule, experienced engineers and craftsman say, help. But knowing the details also lets you know when the details don't matter, which is what Visual Studio/Intellisense provides. (I'm sure there's a pithy proverb that could be said here, but I don't feel up to thinking up a quip).

Answer 20: 

    
    
Interesting question. Sure I find Intellisense in some sense makes the job easier, but it's kind of like money. The more you have, the more you spend, not necessarily on things you need. I learned to program around '62, and somehow I got along without Intellisense for a really long time. What Intellisense does for me now is help me remember lots of classes and members that as little as 4 years ago I never knew I needed.

There's one tendency I've seen in software that never fails. Nature abhors a vacuum. Machines get bigger, so guess what, software gets bigger (but not always better). Machines get faster, so software gets slower. Now people can get help typing long names, so the code gets really verbose. Now people get help remembering lots of classes, so guess what, there are lots more classes to remember. This goes a long way to helping the software get bigger and slower.

I do a lot of performance tuning, and what is the dominant cause of slowdown? It is galloping generality caused by overdesign with too much data structure, too many classes, and too many layers of abstraction. In a word, "bloat". Here is just a small example.
    
    
Answer 21: 

    
    
I find Visual Studio's tools conducive towards more experimentation. When you're dealing with the Win32 API in C (for example) you can't really poke around too easily. When you're working with C#, it's a snap to have a little explore around a library and learn what it does without breaking out MSDN or a disassembler for the entire evening.

If you're a naturally curious programmer, Intellisense won't change that. If you're not, Intellisense won't change that either. To paraphrase one of my colleagues "I think it's a waste of time looking through huge books when you can just take an implementation from the web and move on to the next thing".

It's an old argument anyway, pre-Intellisense. Does BASIC rot the mind where writing in x86 doesn't? Is knowing an algorithm inside out relevant when every single programming language you're going to use in your role has a tried and tested library?

I find that those who consider programming a hobby or a skill are inclined to comprehend and investigate. Those who consider it the day job don't. Regardless of any frippery around it, it's more about a programmer's mindset than what is made available.
