Title: Prevent Visual Studio Server Explorer from auto-populating
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am running into a frustrating issue with Visual Studio in which every time I open or refresh a solution, Visual Studio locks up for about 30 seconds and then I am met with this error



This happens about 10 times, so it takes about five minutes to get a working instance of Visual Studio.

I eventually traced this to entries in Server Explorer to which I don't have access. These seem to be auto-populated from connection string entries in various Web.config files throughout the solution. If I comment out the connection strings, the solution loads fine. But this is not an ideal solution because I don't want to commit these changes to source control.

Is there a way to stop this auto-population of Server Explorer? I don't remember this ever happening in previous version of Visual Studio, so maybe it's new in 2015?

I want to build an IDE based on Eclipse for embedded Linux app development. 

I know Eclipse CDT is good for c/c++ developing. But I need to do a lot of customization. The GNU ARM Eclipse is very close to what I need, but my target architecture is not ARM.

So, where should I start? Is CDT just enough and easy for customization? Thanks a lot.

serial.PARITY_NONE
serial.EIGHTBITS

#Set Rotor size

port.write(bytes([53, 4, 36, 0, 83]))
print("Set Rotor size")
data = port.read(20)
data1= list(data)
print(data1)


I get the following correct output


  
    
Set Rotor size
[53, 1, 4, 0, 83, 53, 27, 0, 132, 83]

    
  


But when I try to run in the linux terminal, I get different output which is wrong.

I was used to the Eclipse IDE that when you hover the mouse on any place in the code it shows a text over the editor (in a popup window) with things like the Error of the line, the documentation of the variable and etc..

Now on VisualStudio the same function exists and I'm able to use the texttip to check the objects docs and etc.. my question is:

How can I focus the popup window so I can copy the text from the tip?

I am starting to set up Xdebug with sublime-text2.
In my case, I have two different applications those are integrated as one. Let's named A and B.

I have XDebug set up for the project B and I can start to debug.
From the A site there is a link to the site B, so I want start debuging the application A and when I click the link to the application B, continue debugging the application B.

Is that possible?

I am going to try this approach
How can I debug two projects in eclipse at the same time?

but I coudn't find the sublime way, so in the mind time maybe some of you, dear reader, can point me to the right direction.

Thanks in advance.

I have only seen to set one url by project.

EDIT:
I have configured the xdebug sublime plugin as by project and when I launch the debugger from the A site, the debug session is launched on both sides. I can see the breakpoint at the B site from the debug session at project A. 
But when I follow a link at site A, the

/?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=devwebsite_ide_key

parameter is lost so the debug session is detached in the browser even if at sublime the debug session is still running.

Any ideas?

I had the same issue, it's because Delphi is now more connected to Windows, i.e. the problem with Page Control being white! I fixed this by Control Panel - Window Color and Appearance - Advanced appearance settings, I then selected the Window Text and set the colour I wanted. This changed the colours default in Delphi. So I just reset the background colour to default and I now have a subtle background green for everything. I have literally just done this, so I need to go play with it further, but it's a start.

Perhaps I am being petty (I think not), but I very much like my IDE set up in a particular way. In VS2012, I had a very particular font set:



I have recently upgraded to VS2015 on a different machine, imported my settings from VS2012 and to my disappointment my IDE looks like crap. 


  EDIT: To be very clear, these colors are VERY different. That is what I concerned with. Don't worry about the resolution of the second image




Upon further review, it looks like the String (C# @ Verbatim) setting from VS2012 was not implemented in VS2015. Is that the case? If so, its not well documented and leaves me asking: is VS2015 not fully backward compatible?

How do I make FlashDevelop the default IDE for Adobe Flash Professional?  So that if I try to open an .as file from Adobe Flash Professional, it opens in FlashDevelop instead?

I am coming from Unity where there is just an option in preferences to set your default IDE, but I am struggling to figure it out here in Adobe Flash Professional.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can do this via Windows.


Right-click on any .as file
Click "Open with..."
Click "Browse..."
Navigate to your install folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\FlashDevelop), and select "FlashDevelop.exe"
Click "Open" to select FlashDevelop.exe
Make sure that "Always use the selected program to open this kind of file" is checked
Click "OK"


From now on, ActionScript files will open in FlashDevelop.

NOTE: If you have multi-instance mode turned on, a new instance of FlashDevelop will run every time you open an .as file from Windows Explorer.

I want to know if there is any place where eclipse stores all my configurations so that only the config files can be ported across different machines(even different OS's)

If I spend my time customizing eclipse on my desktop , spending the same amount of time on every machine I work on is a no brainier. I was hoping eclipse stores its files in some directory in home directory(~/.emacs.d on linux/mac mainly, but use windows often as well) just like emacs does. With this I can easily put all my configurations under VCS and get exactly the same look and feel on every machine. I have done this for emacs actually and it works great. Like this https://github.com/anooprh/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs.d

I could not find anything like that for eclipse. The closest I could find was .eclipse folder in home directory

[user@localhost .eclipse]$ pwd
/home/user/.eclipse
[user@localhost .eclipse]$ ls
org.eclipse.platform_4.4.1_1473617060_linux_gtk_x86_64  org.eclipse.platform_4.4.1_1756587775_linux_gtk_x86_64


I dont know what these two directories. Inside that there were was a configuration directory as well, but could not find anything useful. 

I want to know from people who have been using eclipse for some time as to how they manage to port their config files from one machine to another.

Title: How to edit a PyCharm macro?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is it possible to edit (add / change) PyCharm macros?  

Context:

The GUI 'Edit Macro' option (below) allows macro actions to be removed or renamed, but not added or edited.


Attempted Solution:

If you record a macro in PyCharm, it is stored in a config folder as macros.xml when PyCharm closes.

&lt;application&gt;
  &lt;component name="ActionMacroManager"&gt;
    &lt;macro name="Example Macro"&gt;
      &lt;typing text-keycode="77:1;89:0"&gt;My&lt;/typing&gt;
      &lt;action id="EditorEnter" /&gt;
      &lt;typing text-keycode="69:1;88:0;65:0;77:0;80:0;76:0;69:0"&gt;Example&lt;/typing&gt;
      &lt;action id="EditorEnter" /&gt;
      &lt;typing text-keycode="77:1;65:0;67:0;82:0;79:0"&gt;Macro&lt;/typing&gt;
    &lt;/macro&gt;
  &lt;/component&gt;
&lt;/application&gt;


If you close PyCharm, edit the XML file, then PyCharm will subsequently notice the changes on start up ... and reject them:



Curses! 

Logically the state must be stored somewhere else so that it can be reloaded/reset on start-up. 

Does anyone know if it is possible to make the edited XML changes apply? If there's any option to edit the state, or force loading of the XML then it would be a super-useful way to edit and share macro files...

I've Googled and FAQ'ed my way around the internet with no success - at this point any pointers or suggestions would be very helpful.

Answer 1: 

    
    
None of JetBrains IDEs provide support for maxscript:(, and I'm not aware of any custom plugins for this language. 
If all you need is a basic syntax highlighting, you can either try searching for MaxSript textmate bundles (see Is it possible to get Ruby syntax highlighting in PHPStorm?) or register your own file type, defining a syntax highlighting for it (http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/webhelp/new-file-type.html).
If none of these options look suitable for you, try developing your own language plugins - see http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/Developing+Custom+Language+Plugins+for+IntelliJ+IDEA
    
    
Answer 2:

Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use non-blocking code patterns, which are executed in special frequencies or times. In the following, I give you an short example how you can replace a delay(1000) and a delay(5000) without blocking the main loop. In addition, you can check stackoverflow for similar posts (e.g. Pause without Delay() arduino). 

   // 1 sec. frequency
unsigned long interval=1000;    // the time we need to wait
unsigned long previousMillis=0; // millis() returns an unsigned long.

// 5 sec. frequency  
unsigned long interval1=5000;    // the time we need to wait
unsigned long previousMillis1=0; // millis() returns an unsigned long.

void setup() {
   //...
}

void loop() {

 // other CMD's...

 // replace delay(1000) 
 if ((unsigned long)(millis() - previousMillis) &gt;= interval) {
    previousMillis = millis();
    // every first second
    // ... 
 }

 // other CMD's...

 // replace delay(5000) 
 if ((unsigned long)(millis() - previousMillis1) &gt;= interval1) {
    previousMillis1 = millis();
    // every fifth second
    // ... 
 }

 // other CMD's...
}

I see you're using NeoPixels! It just so happens that Adafruit has some great tutorials on using millis() and micros() for timing purposes instead of delay(). They also include good material on interrupts, if you're feeling ambitious and want to separate your timing from your main function entirely (a worthwhile undertaking, if you have the time and resources).

Part 1 (basics of using millis()):

https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-1/overview

Part 2 (introduces interrupts):

https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-2/overview

Part 3 (puts everything together):

https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-3/overview



Edit 1:

Alright, I edited your code, adding in a loop that checks for both delay periods to be done using millis(). I attempted to stick to the variable naming conventions that you've been using, for easy readability. There were also some other issues with your code syntax that I cleaned up. Make sure to effectively comment your code so that it's understandable, for yourself and for others!

Hopefully this works the way you want it to!

/*The goal of the sketch is to run multiple strip where each dot could be 
controlled on/off one after the others but with different times on/off between each
pixel on each strip. All be independent and separate and automated and structured

// Library include
#include &lt;FastLED.h&gt;

void setup() {
  FastLED.addLeds&lt;NEOPIXEL, DATA_PIN1&gt;(leds1, NUM_LEDS1);
  FastLED.addLeds&lt;NEOPIXEL, DATA_PIN2&gt;(leds2, NUM_LEDS2);
}

int dot_delay1[] = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000};
int dot_delay2[] = {100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600};

void loop() {
  for (int dot1 = 0; dot1 &lt; NUM_LEDS1; dot1++) {

      // LED turns blue
      leds1[dot1] = CRGB::Blue;
      leds2[dot2] = CRGB::Blue;
      // Show LED status
      FastLED.show();
      // LED turns black
      leds1[dot1] = CRGB::Black;
      leds2[dot2] = CRGB::Black;
      // Create timing variables
      unsigned long previousMillis = millis();
      unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
      // Create boolean variables to monitor if the delays have triggered yet
      bool delayFlag1 = false, delayFlag2 = false;
      // Loop continuously
      while (1) {
        currentMillis = millis();
        // If the first delay time has passed, delayFlag1 is true
        if ((unsigned long)(millis() - previousMillis) &gt;= dot_delay1[dot1]) {
          delayFlag1 = true;
        }
        // If the second delay time has passed, delayFlag2 is true
        if ((unsigned long)(millis() - previousMillis) &gt;= dot_delay2[dot2]) {
          delayFlag2 = true;
        }
        // If both delay times have passed (both delay flags are true), exit while loop
        if ((delayFlag1 &amp;&amp; delayFlag2) == true) {
          break;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}


This new code should work, I've tested it and it works as expected on my machine.

As a side note, your original question was "How can I replace delay() by millis()?". This question has been answered both by myself and by the previous answer author, user3704293. In the future it may be helpful to separate your questions to get higher quality answers and to better serve those who are searching for answers to the same questions. Once your question is answered, as I hope this question is now, you should accept the answer that is the best for you.

Let me know if it all works out!



Edit 2:

To have LEDs change independently of each other, replace the loop() function in the previous code with this one.

void loop() {
  // Create timing variable

Title: Force IntelliJ to use another Home Directory?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have read this... it does not answer the question.

I would like to have IntelliJ use another location for all of my project files.  Currently, it goes to c:\users\ as a default project location.

I want to change that to c:\git.

I tried to change the "Start in" link properties, to no avail.

I don't want to force all of the configuration (ie: the .IdeaIC15 folder) to be relocated, I just want it to go to c:\git when I click "Open project".

https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/207240985-Changing-IDE-default-directories-used-for-config-plugins-and-caches-storage

Locations can be changed by editing the following file:

IDE_HOME\bin\idea.properties

Follow the comments in idea.properties file to change the defaults, make sure to un-comment the lines defining these properties:

idea.config.path
idea.system.path
idea.plugins.path
idea.log.path

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
To change the directory where project files are located to C:\git:

Select Help-&gt;Edit Custom VM Options...

Add the following line to the end of the file that comes up in the editor (*):
-Duser.home=C:\git

Restart IntelliJ.


(*) The file that comes up in the editor will either be idea64.exe.vmoptions or idea.exe.vmoptions.
Notes:

This will update/create a .vmoptions file in your config directory. It does not modify the vmoptions file in your install directory.
The above steps do not change the default directory that is used
when cloning git repositories. This is the directory that is used in
the File-&gt;New-&gt;Project from Version Control-&gt;Git window. You
still need to set that directory to C:\git and clone one remote repo
into C:\git. Once you have done that IntelliJ remembers the directory and
uses it for subsequent clones.

Is there any way I can stop IntelliJ IDEA from formatting the copyright header of Java files?

We have set up a copyright profile for our Java files, which works fine. But formatting the code (via Code /p/div

You could try enabling Formatter Control

I want to run several instances of delphi7 each with one software I'm making, I'm using windows 10 which it suppose virtual desktops, but they don't work like that if you create another virtual desktop and you open a .dpr file, it bring the first delphi instance.

btw with the desktops.exe app which you can create virtual desktops in windows 8, you can really make virtual desktops and run in every desktop a different delphi ide instances, but with windows10 virtual desktops you can't.
there is  a work around of this????
