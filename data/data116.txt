I am new to PyCharm. When I was trying to clone my project from mercurial, PyCharm continues cloning for ever until I stopped the operation. The test connection was also successful. I was thinking it may be because of not giving my username and password for the repository. But I couldn't find anywhere to pass my credentials. For now I am doing it manually, But I need to know proper solution for this. Please help me by giving me an idea.

Thanks in advance 
    

        
Title: Working on Eclipse 3.8 with Rails 4.0: Project/App Explorer does not show new files, maybe because of git?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Been working on Hartl's Rails tutorial. However, after starting chapter 6, I found that Eclipse's App Explorer does not show any new files anymore.
Eg running rails generate model User does indeed generate the file user.rb in app/models/, however the App Explorer does not show the file.
Also, when I just copy and paste other files like images, css etc. into the app's folders they are not shown in eclipse.

Maybe I screwed up with git? Thanks for your help!
    

        
Title: How to force order of folders in compiler search path?
Description: 
    
    
                    
My 'Debug configuration - All platforms' search path setting is ..\PatchLibs, search path inheritance is checked.

I want to temporarily add a folder to search in when a source file cannot be found in ..\PatchLibs.

But if I add d:\temp\folder to the project search path setting, I get as search path

D:\Temp\Folder;..\PatchLibs
where I actually want
..\PatchLibs;D:\Temp\Folder

I cannot change this by editing the string, it just changes back.

Is there a way to accomplish this without modifying the 'Debug configuration - All platforms' search path? After all, I want it only this project.
    

        
Title: Cloud 9 and Grunt.js
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm running grunt.js on Cloud9.  Most everything is working correctly, except when I try to set this option:

'watch: {
    options: {livereload:true},'


If I add that, the terminal states:  'Fatal error: listen EACCES'

I'm guessing I need to use the sudo command to run that and since c9 doesn't let you run sudo, the command fails.  

But why is livereload a feature that requires permission?  And is there any way around it?

Maybe you try to enable preview from wrong context? Double click any of your layout and you will see your preview design or xml code. If it xml, you will have tabs Design/Text on the bottom of center column. Just switch it to Design.
    
    
Title: In a Code::Blocks project - have source code files reside in a &ldquo;src&rdquo; folder
Description: 
    
    
                    
I need to use Code::Blocks on one of my machines to work on some C and C++ code. So I installed it. It works great.

Something that I noticed was that the source code resides in the root of the project along with config files and other stuff. This is unlike other IDEs where you have a "src" sub-folder that contains the source code, a "doc" or "docs" folder where you you could put some text files and so on.

For the sake of unification with other projects, setups and the general rules that we follow in our company (and for other reason not important for this question) I would like to be able to have a "src" sub-folder where I put all source code. I want this to be the location from where the IDE will read the tree structure for the Workspace/Project_name/Sources browser.

I looked at the config XML files but couldn't find any specific option that will allow me to relocate the source code tree.

I know that I can just create the "src" folder, put the "main.c" files, etc. but that doesn't look like the right way of doing it. When you start opening the source files it prepends all with "src/..." - that's the least.

Is it possible to copy all your header file to a central point after a build is done? I've added this line to the Pre-Build steps in eclipse:

cp "${WorkspaceDirPath}/${ProjName}/*.h" "${WorkspaceDirPath}/Libs/include/";

Answer 1: 

    
    
I faced similar problem and following worked for me.

1.On Eclipse Parallel 2018-12 ( Synchronized C/C++ project) for remote projet

Instead of using environment variables, I used relative paths. To use wildcard, keep it outside the argument of function e.g

cp "../src/hal/pi-linux/bsp/bsp.h" "../src/hal/pi-linux/include"; 
cp "../src/hal/pi-linux/drivers/"*/*.h "../src/hal/pi-linux/include";


2.On Eclipse CDT for local project

If project is build locally, env variables are expanded correctly

Pre-build

cp "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/src/pbDev}/*.h" "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/include/}"; 
cp "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/src/pbDev/include/sys/gcc}/*.h" "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/include/}";


Post-build

cp lib${ProjName}.a "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/lib/}";


Try if it works. Since question was asked quite a while ago, so answering in hope that it will be helpful for anyone still facing similar problem.

Title: How To Identify Scroll Bar Position Using Selenium IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
Now, I know Selenium IDE doesn't have this functionality, hence I'm using the user-extension.js. Here's what my javascript code says.

Selenium.prototype.getToppos = function ()
{
  var Top;
  Top = window.pageYOffset;
  return Top;
}


And on my selenium IDE here's what i wrote

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;verifyToppos&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;


Now the result is correct, which is 0, but after I checked around and play with the scroll bar, turns out this 0 is not from the website that I wanted to be checked. Instead it's checking the scroll bar position of the selenium IDE window. Is there anyway I can tell Selenium IDE that it is supposed to get the scroll position of the website that I open, and not the Selenium IDE window it self?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I've done it with a simple storeEval command:

&lt;!-- jump to the footer, and get the scroll position's Y co-ordinate offset --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;click&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;link=Skip to footer&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;storeEval&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;this.browserbot.getUserWindow().pageYOffset&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;footerScrollPosition&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;


In the eval commands, this.browserbot gets you the browser instance that is running your site, rather than the Selenium test runner browser instance.

You can then perform assertions on the resultant value with an assertEval command:

&lt;!-- assert that the footer Y position is greater than the main content Y position --&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;assertEval&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${footerScrollPosition} &gt; ${contentScrollPosition}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;


(where I'd previously performed another storeEval to create the variable currentScrollPosition)

Does this work for you?

I've been struggling with an error with IntelliJ IDEA 12.1.4 when creating a new Android project.

I've tried all the possible solutions that I found online but never ran into any solution.

On the console panel it says "The project wasn't generated by 'android' tool."

However with the Eclipse, I can create an Android project (using the same SDK setup with IntelliJ and there are no errors.)

Also, when I import the project that I create in Eclipse previously, IntelliJ works just fine!

Within the Cloud9 IDE, if the focus is set to the Files sidebar (toggleable via ctrl + u), how does one refocus on the editor window to continue coding without reverting to using the mouse?

My current workaround is to hit ctrl + g for go to line {n}, but this adds unnecessary steps and can lead to the page scrolling to a completely different location than currently working on.

There is no shortcut for this.
But it is easy to add with user script

var editors = require("ext/editors/editors");
require("ext/commands/commands").addCommand({
    name: "focusEditor",
    exec:function() {
        if (editors.currentEditor)
            editors.currentEditor.focus();
    },
    bindKey: "ctrl-alt-w"
});


if you can think of a good shortcut for this suggest it on https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9/issues/2032#issuecomment-9427700 too
    
    
Title: How to stop nodeclipse from jumping cursor outside function calls
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been having a problem since I started using Eclipse with nodeclipse plugin. When I call a javascript method that takes a callback, the editor jumps the the cursor to the position after the closing parenthesis of the object method, e.g.

obj.foo(a, function(){
  console.log('message');
});


as I type the console.log call, the cursor is inside the quotes, after message. I press tab once, and the cursor jumps outside the closing quote of 'message'. I press it again, and it jumps outside the closing parenthesis console.log('message'). I type semi-colon and press enter, and instead of the editor creating a new line under the console.log() call, it jumps to the end of the obj.foo() call.

I looked in the formatting options but I couldn't find a setting that addresses this functionality, and I tried searching SO and google,but  can't find a search term that gives relevant results.

Please help? It's driving me nuts and killing my productivity.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Generally when running into software strange behavior, the steps are (for the Nodeclipse)


update JDK
get latest Eclipse (now 4.3.0 Kepler)
get latest plugin version (Nodeclipse will be 0.5 next week)


In case you are using on Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers, I also ran into strangeness Delete key sometimes doesn&#39;t work in HTML Editor of Nodeclipse NTS (Based on Eclipse 4.3 Kepler)

Now I switched to SDK and IDE for Java/SDL developers, that seems more "tidy". Next Eclipse distribution "Enide Studio" will be based on Eclipse IDE for Java/SDL developers.
The page with download recommendation http://www.nodeclipse.org/updates/ was updated.

BTW, I usually don't use Tab as in Editor it has meaning "several spaces". Just use arrows keys. Nice to know anyway.

Title: Graphics.DrawLine, AccessViolation, Visual Studio IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
Having difficulty with Graphics.DrawLine Creating an Access Violation.  Tried Restarting VS2010/the computer, Repairing the Framework, windows update, and looking for any kind of patches or patches to remove.  Nothing seems to get rid of it.  Even the sample on the MS site crashes with the error.  Not sure what to look for to fix it.  It used to work so I'm betting its a bad patch somewhere, just not sure which.  Currently running under windows XP.

Update 1: Updated the code to cross reference with the API.  DrawLineInt uses the Framework, DrawLineInt2 use the API commands.  They both violate on the DrawLine Function.  Throwing this sample into VB6 does not create this problem.  

Update 2: Apparently, if the VS studio environment settings are set to C++ this bug doesn't occur.  Resetting settings and putting it back to "Visual Basic" causes this bug to reappear.  Uninstalling/Installing VS2010 and the .NET frameworks did nothing to fix this.  Running a built executable does not cause a crash in the executable, but can crash VS...hmmm..?

Update 3: Tried other drawing methods, and added a call trace below.  Apparently any methods that use a PEN cause the exception, but the ones with a BRUSH do not.  When tracing inside the copy_32 method the pointer to the draw space is invalid (either 0x0 or 0xBAADF00D).  This also makes a GroupBox useless as it uses the same draw routines.

Found the solution that worked for me.  Either upgrade or rollback your video drivers.

I have a Radeon HD6950 with driver version 9.00.100.10.  When I rolled back the driver to version 8.980.0.0. the "gdipdrawline" errors stopped.  This means all the controls that used the function now also work.  I can confirm working the GroupBox and the DataGridView as they previously crashed with the same or similar call stacks.
    
    
Title: Change font size in the project explorer view in Eclipse [duplicate]
Description: 
    
    
                    
How can I configure the font size for the tree item in the package explorer/outline in Eclipse?

Which item in Font under Preferences I should change?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In 2010, there was no way in Eclipse to change the font used for Package Explorer and other such views. You can only change the font for editor views. This is a policy decision on the part of the Eclipse developers (see, e.g., bugs 49548, 202091). (Grumble.) The font used is the one set by the general look-and-feel for whatever desktop you are using.

On Linux it is possible to override the system font when you invoke Eclipse. An excellent writeup of various possibilities is here, to which I owe this answer. I'll repeat one suggestion from there for posterity. Create a file named, say, gtkrc-eclipse:

style "eclipse" {
  font_name = "Sans Condensed 8"
}
class "GtkWidget" style "eclipse"


Then set a certain environment variable when invoking eclipse:

$ GTK2_RC_FILES=gtkrc-eclipse eclipse

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Does your Eclipse .ini file contain a reference to 'smallFonts?' On Mac you might see something like...

-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts

If you remove this line, you'll see the font size in various views fatten up.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
On Windows 7, you can affect many of the Eclipse GUI fonts, including the Project Explorer by going to:

Control Panel → Personalization → Window Color and Appearance → Advanced Appearance Settings

Change the font size for "Message Box".

Of course this messes with the appearance of other stuff in your OS, but I've found that tolerable compared to squinting at the project explorer...
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I just found all those answers for changing the tree view font size in Eclipse, tried several and finally got on the CSS class which reads quite more fashionable to me:

The theme I'm using includes the "e4_basestyle.css" in eclipse/opt/plugins/platform/css. There I added 

.MPart Tree {
    font-size: 10;
}


which works very fine with me (Eclipse&nbsp;v4.3-SR2 (Kepler) on Ubuntu).

Here is an option that works on my Windows7 machine suggested by Diego V:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/15011440/1713920


  On Juno you can adjust that font by CSS.
  
  Lookup the files in eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.platform_4.2.x.y\css
  for your current style sheet (probably e4_default_win7.css), and then
  just add the following rule:

#org-eclipse-jdt-ui-PackageExplorer Tree,
#org-eclipse-ui-navigator-ProjectExplorer Tree {
    font-size: 10px; /* &lt;-- Desired font size */
}

This answer applies to Mac OS X user. Tested with Mavericks (10.9.2) but should work in all versions.

As stated before in previous answers, to change the font size in package explorer you need to change system font size. The problem here is to do exactly this. My solution:


Download the free Tinker Tool utility and adjust font sizes. 
Restart Eclipse




The results:



Happy coding!
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Go into eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_1.1.0.v{HERE_SOME_DIGITS}\css.

Here you see your installed theme CSS files. Choose you theme, and add at the end of file (for example, e4_default_win7.css):

#org-eclipse-jdt-ui-PackageExplorer Tree,
#org-eclipse-ui-navigator-ProjectExplorer Tree {
    font-size: 10px; /* &lt;-- Desired font size */
    font: Consolas;  /* &lt;-- Font you want to have */
}

Around line 204, you can add your chosen font size:

background-color: #2F2F2F;

font-size: 8;

FYI:

From Eclipse&nbsp;v4.4 (Luna):

It looks like the CSS files are no longer in the old folder:

eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.platform_4.x.x.vy/css


They are moved to the new folder:

 eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_x.x.x.vxxxxx/css


And you must select a theme to apply it, in the menu

Windows → Preferences → General → Appearance
    
    
Answer 10: 

    
    
As someone has already mentioned previously, modifying the "e4_basestyle.css" file worked for me on Eclipse&nbsp;v4.3 (Kepler) and Windows&nbsp;8.

Also, I find that you must also change the text size/style under

Preferences → Team → Git → LabelDecorations

or

Preferences → Appearance → ColorsAndFonts, under the Git section.

to make sure that text size/colors for uncommitted files are in sync with your changes. This is of course if you initialise your project as a repository.
    
    
Answer 11: 

    
    
Eclipse uses a system user interface font for Project Explorer, so you can change it with an OS-specific method. Note: Eclipse will have to be restarted even if other apps respond immediately to the font change.


On Linux (Gnome), I was able to alter Eclipse's font with Gnome Tweak Tool (Applications → Utilities → Tweak Tool). If it's not already installed, try sudo yum install gnome-tweak-tool or sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool. In the Fonts page, change the Interface font.
On Windows 7, go to Control Panel → Personalization → Window Color and Appearance → Advanced Appearance Settings → Change the font size for "Message Box". (credit: Nathan Monteleone)
On Mac, unpack the Tinker Tool, run it, go to the Fonts tab and adjust the size of Help tags (tested with Eclipse 2018-12).


Some other parts of Eclipse will also be affected, such as the startup dialog.
    
    
Answer 12: 

    
    
Eclipse inherits the font size of the GUI items, from the operating system. For a demo for example you might want to increase the font size of your OS.
    
    
Answer 13: 

    
    
In Windows 10, 

at the left bottom corner click on the Windows symbol, enter "Display settings", then go to "Advanced display settings", then go to "Advanced sizing of text and other items", there You'll find "Change only the text size":

You'll see a list of 


Title Bars
Menus
Message Boxes
Palette titles
Icons
Tooltips


Switch at least "Message Boxes" to font size e.g. 13 instead of 9 (for Eclipse Package Explorer Tree).

I would switch "Menus" also to font size 13 (for Eclipse main menu).

Or all of them :-)

On Windows 10, if you got hit by the Creators Update:

The Windows 10 Creators Update apparently removed the ability to "Change only the text size" in "Display settings". In addition the update reset my previous text size setting so that I ended up with small font size in the tree items of the package explorer.

A solution that worked for me is to use a small tool 'A+ System Font Size Changer'. There, increasing the "Message box" setting to 4 (a custom unit defined by the tool) and applying the setting changed the font size in the items of the package explorer. 

The tool also allows you to increase the size of "Menu", "Title bar", "Palette title", "Icon" (which worked wonders on the display of folders in windows explorer), and "Tooltip".

Answer 1: 

    
    
If your eclipse project metadata (mentioned in my previous answer) are versioned at the same level than your source in ClearCase, then you should be to:


update a snapshot view with the (one or many) projects
import that project into your workspace




If that is working (meaning you find all your jar, and JRE settings back after importing one project from the sources), then you can try importing a PSF.

Importing a "Project Set File" (psf), means referencing the VCS (see "Structure of a Project Set File"), that is your ClearCase sources in your case.
So first try importing a project, then the psf.

At first it sorta sounds like a path problem, but if you're able to run a debugger tutorial that's probably not the case.

The behavior you're seeing if the program isn't compiled with the debug (-g) flag doesn't quite match my experience, but let's go ahead and check/set the debug flag anyway.

Select Project/Edit Project_Properties

Click the Switches tab.

Click the Gnatmake tab.

Check "Debug information". Note that a -g now shows up in the text box at the bottom of the tab page. Click OK on the dialog.

Recompile your code so that it uses the changed option. Select Build/Clean/Clean All, and OK any dialog that pops up.

Then do your build (you can just press F4).

I am about to learn Emacs, have been through the tutorial and borrowed the O'Reilly book on Emacs. But the question still is - how do you learn good Emacs workflow? I guess, you don't use Emacs as you'd use, for example, Vim.

This question seems revelant to mine:
 - Where can I find a video of a professional using Emacs?

I can't believe nobody has mentioned this, but reading the info pages bundled with Emacs is a great way to learn about obscure features.  Whenever you need a break from coding, hit M-x info and pick a random page to read.  Your emacs ability will improve incredibly quickly.

It is also important to realize how emacs' self-documenting-ness helps you work.  Say, for example, you are wondering how you can scale the font size.  Instead of interrupting your flow and asking here, or on IRC, or Google, you can ask emacs!  Just hit C-h a (M-x command-apropos) and type a search term, in our case scale.  If there are matching functions, their names, keybindings, and documentation will appear.  There are, and now you've just discovered text-scale-increase and text-scale-decrease.

There are other self-documentation functions that are good to learn C-h m will tell you what keybindings and commands are available in the current major and minor modes.  This is a great way to discover features you didn't know existed.

Another way to "learn by osmosis" is to M-x customize-group for the modes you use regularly.  (customize is the interactive configuration editor that almost all modes support.)

The final thing to do is to learn Emacs Lisp.  It is nice to use existing tools, but sometimes you will need your own.  If you try to avoid learning Lisp, you will always be stuck with things not quite working right, and that's a shame.  

Emacs is a great environment for customizing itself.  Emacs includes two Lisp manuals that are viewable via M-x info.  It is self-documenting, so you can say C-h f or M-x describe-function to get the documentation for any function.  You can even press TAB ENT to jump to the source code of that function, to see how it's implemented.  This is great when you think "I wish I had something that worked like foo, but just slightly different."  You can read how foo is implemented, make your change in the *scratch* buffer, and then see if you like the change.  There is no edit/compile/test cycle.  You press a key and your emacs session immediately has the feature you just wrote.

The more effort you put into learning emacs, the more emacs will do to make your work easier.

Once you mastered the basics (opening/closing files, navigating, basic editing) just use it. As with a lot of other tools, practise makes perfect...

I would, however, set some time aside to work on improving how you use the editor currently, but as part of your normal workflow as opposed to just going off on a tangent and learning things for the sake of it.

I find some useful resources are the EmacsWiki and the Planet Emacsen blog. I use both, mainly by using Planet Emacsen for "inspiration" and then wandering over to EmacsWiki and having a trawl on there for a specific topic. I found that unless you're having at least a vague idea what you're looking for, the available information is just going to swamp you instead of it actually being helpful.

Not to mention that there are a few very useful resources here on StackOverflow, for example this question here. Emacs is a very powerful tool that tends to be able to do a lot more than a single person needs, but in the end that allows you to pick and choose exactly those parts that you need.

My suggestion is just stop using anything but Emacs, when you come across a problem see if you can solve it in Emacs, and then fall back (if you don't have the time or it just won't work).  As for work flow, it is pretty much the same as you would normally work. i.e. for a normal ide session you would open/edit a file as normal, then commit (in C-x v v) just as normal.

I agree with the other posters here, you just have to use it! Here's how I did it:

Once I got the very basics (can get between buffers, open/save files, etc), I printed out a reference card and kept it handy. This is a good one. Review it just so you know what is on it, then whenever you find yourself doing something repeatedly that is on the card, start using the shortcut! Before you know it you'll have memorized quite an arsenal of commands. But remember, probably no one uses everything that emacs can do.

When you eventually find yourself doing something repeatedly that doesn't have a shortcut, that's a good time to learn keyboard macros. Once you get them, you'll find uses for them everywhere! From there it's a short jump to writing elisp (if you're a programmer).

The great thing about emacs is that you don't need an "emacs workflow", emacs works around your workflow!

You don't need to learn emacs workflow. Once you complete the tutorial and master the essentials, you'll have to adopt some degree of monogamy and use nothing but Emacs. Eventually you will think of functionality that you really wished existed; most of the time somebody else will have as well and the solution is just one search away! Over time you just can't help but learn and eventually you'll pick up enough that you'll develop your own personal workflow.

If you're looking to accelerate the process, the Emacs wiki has a variety of tips but really the best way is just to do stuff with Emacs.

You could have a look at Bram Molenaar's talk about efficient textediting, http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2538831956647446078&amp;ei=EqiGSau8KZ-QiQLi-Nn8Cg&amp;q=bram+molenaar+editing

Although he's a vim guy (he wrote it), you might get some ideas about how best to go about becoming more proficient with your text editor that'll apply to emacs.

To be honest, all I do is learn the keybindings I need. I don't use emacs to its full potential, because I don't need its full potential. My suggestion is to just learn what you need, and don't worry about what you don't. Learn a new key binding everyday, and in about 300 years will you know them all ;)

I am using the emacs since the old Amiga days on all platforms i am currently working on.

The best way to use emacs is curiosity. I still use often apropos (C-h a) and M-x (for a long functionname instead of key-binding) to find a functionality.

a key-concept to "proper use" Emacs is, to learn the very easy elisp (a simple derivate of lisp) and write your own little helpers (own commenting style, underlining, templates) and to know where to look to change values (tab-size, compiler, email)

And the third thing: everything is in emacs: I use the dired (directory editor) for navigating through files. I use a lot of buffers for all textual files (with proper modes for each type of file (c, ruby, list, sql, latex, ...)) which are stored when quitting emacs and recovered when invoking. I start the compiler from emacs and use the jump-to-error-functionality.

Macros are a daily routine (scimming throu code and changing it on the way).

I like the picture-mode, which allows to type downward with replacing, which makes it easy to renumber block of constants (good old c #defines))

There is a hugh mountain to climb, but if you have reached the top, you can see the whole world down your feet, and never want to miss this experience again. I know, there are many good editors around (i work myself thru Eclipse)

As previously stated, the best advice is to use nothing but Emacs for the next year.  Once you develop your finger memory, things get to be much easier.

How do you learn a "good workflow" for anything? By using it, getting to know it, making it yours. There is no "proper" use of Emacs.

As for getting to know it: ask Emacs -- use its help system. This can help too: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsNewbieWithIcicles

That's the power of Emacs, you use it the way you like. You just have to configure it before for your liking.
