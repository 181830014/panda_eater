Title: ssms script trigger timeout
Description: 
    
    
                    
Using the SSMS (Sql server management studio) 2008 ide, I frequently get timeouts asking it to script a trigger (or table) to a new query editor window.

This particular time, the error message is Script failed for Trigger 'spbldrom_update'.
Additional information: 
- An exception occurred while executing a Trasact-SQL statement or batch.
- Timeout expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding. (Microsoft SQL Server)

It takes about 5 minutes for the timeout to occur.

It happened on my prior computer.  It happens on my new Windows XP computer, and my new Windows 7 computer.

I have searched for other people reporting this, but have not found many reports, and no answers, other than increasing the timeout.  But since it takes about 5 minutes to get the timeout, I don't think increasing the timeout will help.
    

        
Title: PHP/MySQL/Apache/JS with Visual Studio 2010?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm working on a project that uses a PHP, MySQL, Apache, and runs on a Linux server. Is there any plugin so that I can use Visual Studio as my IDE?

Preferably, it would be something free, unlike VS.PHP which apparently costs $100/year.

And, I'm running the VS 2010 beta.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There's this.  It's also reported that VS 2010 will support PHP natively.

EDIT: I couldn't find anything more definitive than this regarding 2010 support, but a quick google search suggests lots of people are under that impression.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Please try our VS.Php for Visual Studio 2010 beta:

http://svn.jcxsoftware.com
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I actually reviewed VS.PHP and gave it a thumbs-down.
To be honest it did most of the stuff right but had some minor quirks like indenting problems, variable suggestion fails, etc..

Currently reviewing http://www.devsense.com/products/php-tools/download
First impression is quite good but I didn't do any decent coding in it tbh.
    
    
Title: intelliJ Find Usages
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Netbeans the Find Usages feature only finds usages in java class..it doesnt find usages in JSP code. 

Does intelliJ find usages for a method in a JSP scriptlet as well?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes it finds usages in any file under the directories that you've specified as "source directories".  It has problems with determining whether or not a matching word in dynamically typed files (example: Groovy) are actually references to your object.  Sometimes you get false positives in that situation and sometimes they don't appear in the results (kind of frustrating).  But other than that it works like a charm.

I replaced the freemarker jar in plugin directory and I am using clean option also .. but couldn't find anything... 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
FreeMarker is a bit old (latest release in December 2008).

Can you check you reproduce the problem with eclipse Ganymede 3.4(.x), that is older version, or eclipse 3.5.1 (more recent)?
SWT might have evolve in non-compatible way since then. Or it might just be an old bug still un-resolved (like the 115253 one, or the 287886, which should have been fixed in 282218, but for Mac and probably only in 3.5.1).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There's no mention of Freemarker classes in the above stack trace. What editor are you using?

I have Eclipse 3.5.20090621-0832 and Freemarker IDE 1.1.0.M1-N200906060434-H241 and both are working fine. Freemarker IDE is part of JBoss Tools.

You can get the latest development milestone (stable releases only support Eclipse 3.4.2) - note that it requires Eclipse 3.5.1 / Galileo SR1.

Or, if you're using Eclipse's built-in package management, update site is here along with installation instructions
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Just encountered the same problem and tracked it down to:

&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;?php ?&gt;


Basically, it seems like, this Exception is thrown b/c the parser is confused by certain combinations of HTML and PHP.

I can have this Exception thrown just by creating a new PHP-file and fill it with something like that. But the odd thing is it seems like after playing around with it a while makes the Exception disappear. So maybe it's a Unicode-thing neutralized by my editing after a while. 

Anyway, there you go.

Title: Visual studio 2008 adds inline style instead of changing markup
Description: 
    
    
                    
Visual studio 2008 on dragging (say) a td inside a table adds a inline style named style1,style2, and so on......while this might be good thing for some purposes it is just better to have a style="height:80px;" added to the markup of the TD...

is there any way to make VS 2008 not add inline styles and add into the markup of the element.....????

to stop VS 2008 from adding css styles to the page you can turn it off from the Style Application toolbar and set it to manual or customise it according to your wish
    
    
Title: Skip the .xsd when searching
Description: 
    
    
                    
We use the built in table adapter wizard in VS2005 to build a portion of our app, resulting in an enormous .xsd file being generated.

It's never interesting to have this .xsd included when searching through code, so I would like to be able to skip it when using Visual Studio Find. Is this possible?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The only solution I could find is a workaround: Download the free baregrep program and use it to search your source directory.  You can set baregrep to search only .vb files and even though it searches the designer files (which you probably do not want) you can see which source files you need to search individually.  Baregrep is a really fine search program, handy to have on your machine.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Seems the best solution is to switch from Quick Find to Find In Files which gives us the "Look at these file types:" option. Instead of one of the defaults:

*.vb;*.resx;*.xsd;*.wsdl;*.xml;*.htm;*.html;*.css


Set it to just:

*.vb;

    
    
Title: what is the shortcut key for opening a resource in RAD 6.0? Ctrl + Shift + R?
Description: 
    
    
                    
This may be a basic question, but I'm still looking for the answer. 

I've been using Eclipse IDE for a long time and I know the shortcut ket Ctrl + Shift + R which will open the resources dialog box. Recently I switched to RAD 6.0 IDE (as per project need), and I could not use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + R in RAD 6.0. The shortcut Ctrl + Shift + L which lists all the keyboard shortcuts, is also not working in my RAD 6.0.

I want to know whether RAD 6.0 does not support these shortcuts keys or is there any other shortcut available for opening a resource in RAD 6.0?

EDIT: When I open the Java browsing perspective, the shortcut key Ctrl + Shift + R is working fine. But it's not working in the Java/J2EE perspecting. Any ideas on how to enable this shortcut key in all the perspectives?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Right click on the toolbar, select Customise Perspective and make sure 'Open Resource' is checked.

The JBossIDE project was superceded by the JBoss Tools project. The downloads are here: http://www.jboss.org/tools/download.html

Title: How can I disable network activity on Aptana (Eclipse IDE) until I save it to speed it up?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm working on a mapped network drive with Aptana. Some activity is making it very slow. Keystrokes may takes seconds to appear. I don't know what activity is causing the problem (background synchronization, backup tmp files, whatever ...), but I need to speed it up.

Any ideas? 

Note: This question may apply to any Eclipse variant, but since I'm only using Aptana, I don't know.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you open the files directly form the mapped network drive, you cannot disable nothing. Depending on how the network connection is made through VPN or a Samba share or whatever, you can see delays. It happen to me while working on VPN. Make a local copy, synchronize it with your network resource only from time to time and this should prevent lags. This is also safer as working directly over various protocols can result in abnormal file erasure. It happen to me while editing directly over FTP.

Now I work in Aptana on a local copy in my local webserver, and from time to time I synchronize with the live version on the live server.
    
    
Title: Browse path / click-though issue
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have Raize 3.0 installed in D2007. For whatever reason, I can't seem to get the Ctr-click to work for loading up it's units, even though that feature works fine on all my other Delphi and Third-Party components.

Here's what I have for Raize on the Library Path:

$(ProgramFiles)\Raize\RC3\Lib6  
$(ProgramFiles)\Raize\RC3\Source


...and the Browsing Path:

$(ProgramFiles)\Raize\RC3\Source


Lib6 contains *.dcu and *.dfm files, and Source contains, obviously, the source code.  Adding Lib6 to the Browsing path doesn't seem to affect things one way or the other.

I don't get why this Ctrl-click unit-loading feature isn't working, just for this one component.  Any ideas what I may be missing?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You shouldn't need Source path in your Library path. Lib6 should be added to Library Path, and Source to Browsing Path.

If you do so, and it still doesn't work, then you have a similar problem with me:

Problem with setting Browsing Path in Delphi option page
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
For lib path you generally don't need source files.  I use:


  C:\Program Files\Raize\RC4\Lib\BDS2007


For browsing path you need to specify the language directory, e.g.:


  C:\Program Files\Raize\RC4\Source\Lang\English


If this doesn't fix it, does your unit compile without errors?
    
    
Title: Viewing version tree in VS2008
Description: 
    
    
                    
Can anybody please tell me how to directly view the ClearCase version tree of a file opened in VS2008 ? I have the source control tool bar in the editor and it has all other option (check in, check out etc) but has no buttons to view the version tree of the file. Can I configure this some how ? Also, I have the clear case add-in dll which was working fine with my VC6 editor. Is there any way I can use this dll with VS2008?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I suppose it depends where you did find your ClearCase plugin.

I just check with one of my ClearCase VS2008 user:

He has 2 tool bars (one CC UCM, one Base CC with the version tree button)

For VS2008, you need first to install the CC plugin like VS2005, then adds some files and .reg to update this installation to a VS2008 compliant CC plugin.



Here is our current ClearCase-VS2008 integration process:

Follow this IBM technote if ClearCase is installed before VS .NET 2005/2003, in order to add "IBM Rational ClearCase Client for VS .NET" in the Custom Setup window step.

Get the CC-CQ-VS2008.zip mentionned this IBM technote and execute "reg_VS2008.bat"



Then tell me if you still do not see any "version tree" button.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Add your own custom commands to the contextmenu.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm pushing app folder and gradle files to git. The purpose is to build an apk file without IDE. It is achieved by
 - installing gradle
 - executing gradle commands from terminal  

But it requires the local.properties file which includes the sdk path of my local system.

Is there any way to build an apk or run gradle without involving sdk  

Docs says


  Applications are usually developed in Java programming language using the Android software development kit (SDK), but other development environments are also available.


what are the other environments? How do I use it?


  the development of an Android application requires an SDK with Java, for iOS apps an iOS SDK with Swift, and for MS Windows the .NET Framework SDK with .NET. There are also SDKs that are installed in apps to provide analytics and data about activity. Prominent examples include Google, InMobi and Facebook.


If I've to build an apk without IDE, I need the source code and gradle software. Do I need sdk as a mandatory? or could it be replaced? If yes How?

Title: ESP8266/NodeMCU Android IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I just got NodeMCU dev kit for ESP8266, and I want to develop for it using my motox2013 Android phone. Any Ideas on how can I do that?

I know there is already an Android IDE for Arduino - Arduino Droid, but I couldn't get it to work with my NodeMCU.
There is an option there for costom hardware, but I get completely lost on how to use it.

Any ideas. on how to make this work?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You have to load the nodeMCU board drivers. To do that you have to:


Go to your settings of the arduino IDE, by pressing Strg + ,.
Enter a URL so that the IDE gets access to the drivers. Enter the following URL: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json, as below:


Now open the Board Manager of the Arduino IDE and search for "esp".
There you get a result called "esp2866". Download the pack.
You now get new Boards to select. 
Selest the NodeMCU 1.0(ESP-12E Module). 


Now you can load up your scripts to the board...
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There is an Android IDE for Arduino but it seems that there is no support for installing additional board packages. So, I am sorry dude.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
As @Maximilian Gerhardt already said, it's important, that you choose the right board.

We're assuming you want to use the Arduino IDE for this.

To be able to work with ESP8266 boards properly, you have to install the fitting boards manager. Go to Boards manager for ESP8266. Do exactly as it says there.

When you have done so, you can go to Tools -em/emem/emem/em/ppa href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4oNzB.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4oNzB.png" alt="NodeMCU ESP8266"/a/pp/pp/ppa href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U7EBF.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U7EBF.png" alt="NodeMCU ESP8266 Example Sketch/Code"/a/ppa href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46741984/8590406"/a/p/div

I'm using the popular IDE NetBeans and I have problems commenting code on the same line. For example, let's say we have the following line:


  &lt;h1&gt; Some text &lt;/h1&gt; comment for h1


I would like to comment the part "comment for h1" through a key combination or some other means but without having to type  manually and without transferring the comment string to the next line.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Why not Select &amp; Replace all such occurences.

You can use Ctrl + Shift + H and enter the text which you want to replace.

Add the text (say comment for h1) to be commented in the field Containing Text, and replace that text with //comment for h1 in the Replace With field.



Then it will show you all the matches which you want to comment. You can select the desired places where you want to place comment before the text.

Finally, click on Replace ? Matches button. Voila, that's it...

You can always create your own keyboard shortcut, see how in this link.

Then you can customize your keyboard to replace your highlighted text with the same text with /* */ , // , &lt;!-- --&gt; or any others before/surrounding the text.

Example:

&lt;h1&gt; Some text &lt;/h1&gt; comment for h1


Highlight the text you need to comment (comment for h1).

Use your customixed shortcut and:

&lt;h1&gt; Some text &lt;/h1&gt; /*comment for h1*/

I am using a groovy configuration file and parse it with ConfigSlurper resulting in a ConfigObject that I use for accessing my configuration.

Answer 2: 

    
    
For every JSP, the JSP compiler generates a corresponding Java class.  So when you save a JSP, Eclipse/MyEclipse is figuring that it needs to do a workspace build to 1) run the JSP compiler, and 2) compile the resulting Java class to bytecodes.

I imagine you can modify this behavior (e.g. via Eclipse/MyEclipse preferences), but I don't use MyEclipse, and I don't do J2EE development this way anyway.

I'm trying to set up a multiplattform project using CMake, so its easy to setup on any PC.

I'm using netbeans 7.2 with NBAndroid extension. In my android project, I'm referencing a library (ActionBarSherlock) that is not in jar (can't be, for some reason). The problem is, that netbeans doesn't see classes from that library and gives me errors (package does not exist etc.) However it builds and runs OK, the library is added correctly. Netbeans just doesn't see it. 

Here is a screenshot.

Here is similar question, no solution package com.actionbarsherlock.app does not exist

Is there a way to fix this? Thanks for help!



EDIT: So I found a way to solve this, it's more a workaround than a solution. I created a jar file from the library classes called classes.jar. I put it in the libs folder, so netbeans sees it. Than I created custom_rules.xml (it's imported via build.xml). In it I move classes.jar away from the libs folder, so I can build it, and in the end I move it back. 

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project name="imported"&gt;

    &lt;copy file="libs/classes.jar" todir="./" /&gt;
    &lt;delete file="libs/classes.jar" /&gt;

    &lt;target name="-post-compile"&gt;

Answer 1: 

    
    
The errors you see are because NetBeans doesn't recognize the packages, classes, methods, etc. When you build or run the program, NetBeans resorts to the Android project's Ant script, which apparently is configured correctly to find the classes. As far as compiling and running, you won't have a problem. However, if you want to use NetBeans' autocomplete and error-detection features, you need to configure it to detect your libs. To do this, just right click on your project name in the Project pane and click Properties from the context menu. Next, click on Libraries under Categories on the left. Then click Add JAR/Folder and navigate to the folder with your third-party library. You can select one of the options for the path then click OK. Now NetBeans should be able to find the identifiers and help you write your code.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Rather than doing some tricks in your build script I'd recommend you to use ActionBarSherlock as a library project. You should be able to do this in project customizer (select project, right click, choose properties).
