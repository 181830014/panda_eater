I want to start use IDE Atom at home, and I faced with problem:


  'osascript' could not be spawned.  Is it installed and on your path? 
  If so please open an issue on the  package spawning the process.


Couldn't find right answer. Does someone can help me with it?
    

        
Title: (How) can I automatically hide all comments in PyCharm? Or, is there any IDE or editor for Python that can?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I know in PyCharm you can hide blocks folding them into one line, but I want to automatically hide all lines of comments in a file, even a single line, and even comments made at the end along a line of code... 

For ex: 

# Base cases: aStr empty or len 1, or middle char = test char
if aStr == '': return False
if len(aStr) == 1: return aStr == char
if char == aStr[guessMidPos]: return True    # We found it!
# Else Recurs: If test character &lt; mid char, search 1st half
elif char &lt; aStr[guessMidPos]:


Is there a button or keyboard shortcut that automatically toggles between the previous and this?

if aStr == '': return False
if len(aStr) == 1: return aStr == char
if char == aStr[guessMidPos]: return True
elif char &lt; aStr[guessMidPos]:


I'd like PyCharm had this, as is the one I'm using more, but I'd love to know of other tools that can do that (too?), specially if PyCharm can't do it. The ones I've been using are Spyder, Sublime text, Notepad++, repl.it, and I'll probably use vim or emacs..., but I would gladly change to anything else just for being able to do this...

Whenever I invoke Quick documentation that pops up yellow box in PyCharm, yellow box shows "Fetching documentation" for 4-8 seconds


It happens even if I do it twice in a row. It's always slow - probably no caching?
It also happens for built-in functions like s=set(); s.add(). Documentation for add takes 5 seconds

Title: How to use Visual Studio automatic brace completion to surround an existing block?
Description: 
    
    
                    
The problem I have with Visual Studio automatic brace completion is that it neglects to understand that I'm trying to surround an entire block. For this reason I habitually disable it, but they've defaulted this to 'on' for years, so I thought I'd try to find out if I'm missing something about how to use Visual Studio efficiently... wouldn't be the first time I went for years without knowing some basic editing feature.

The main problematic case is when I try to surround text, starting with something like lock (myMutex) { around a list of commands:

// Imagine I just typed the following line, where ^ is the cursor
lock (myMutex) {^ }  // &lt;---  it just auto-added " }" to the end.
command1();
command2();
command3();
// where I plan to put the "}"


I then have to press delete the correct number of times to undo the auto-formatting and the wrongly placed braces command, in order to proceed with scooting the cursor down to complete the surrounding.

This seems to be by far the common case, making the braces autocompletion very annoying. Am I doing something wrong? Is there some keyboard sequence I can enter that would sanely result in what I want that I should be using, that I just don't know about? Or am I correct to just disable this every time I reinstall VS?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As far as I know there is nothing built-in in Visual Studio for this task. There are some tools (not free) that greatly improve the Visual Studio editing experience. But as I have said they are not free and sometimes they tend to slow down also the basic operation of Visual Studio.  

However you could create a SurroundsWith snippet. A little automation wizard that you could retrieve and execute also in Visual Studio 2015 right clicking on the selected block of code that you want to be surrounded by braces.


First thing is to download the Snippet Designer using the
Extensions and Updates from the TOOLS menu.
Then open the menu FILE -
Answer 2: 

    
    
I solved this problem with the help of AutoHotKey. I already use this program as a text expander, I simply added:

send, {{}{enter}{}}


to "expand" an open curly bracket with its closed counterpart on a new line. I then go down to that closed bracket and move the whole row with ALT+DOWN after the block I want to surround.
    
    
Title: Surround with suggestions from auto-complete in Intellij?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Suppose you have the following method

void consume(List&lt;String&gt; list) { ...


And somewhere you have, and want to call the method from above. 

String sa = "whatever";


If you type:

sa 

and then put the cursor before sa and want to autocomplete 

Collections.sing|sa then CTRL+Space then Enter

what you'll get is

Collections.singletonList()sa and you want Collections.singletonList(sa)

Is there a way to automatically surround the variable with what auto-complete returns? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Not exactly what you're looking for, but you can get a bit closer with postfix completion. After typing sa and realizing that you want to call a method on it, you can type .parTab to put the parenthesis around it, then Home to go back to the start of the line and you can type Collections.singTab to complete the method call.

That is, I think completion works the way you want if you put the parenthesis around the argument first. I'm not aware of a better way, though I'd be fine to be proven wrong.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I recently installed update 5 of VS 2013 and came across a very annoying new behaviour: When searching text in the current document, the shortcut F3 no longer starts searching from the position of the caret! Rather, it just skips to the next result in its internal list. Thus, it is no longer possible to skip over a block of a lot of irrelevant matches; you always have to visit each and every match, and always in the exact order how they occur in the file!

Is there any hidden switch to bring back the old and much more intuitive behaviour that makes F3 always start at the caret position?

This behaviour seems to be a bug in Visual Studio. It obviously has been there for many years, since it was seen in VS 2013, 2015, 2017. If it was no bug, but intended and default behaviour, then for sure many more people would have complained about it.

The ability to create your own syntax highlighting rules is one of the excellent features of SublimeText.

Have a look here at some other people wanting to build their own syntax highlighting rules:

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am working on an eclipse based customized IDE for our development environment.
In my new perspective I have included a "Project Explorer" and in that I am able to add commands in the context menu, but when I include a new Wizard (A project Wizard) in the "new" type it is shown beneath the "Project" wizard



and I'd want it to be above it. 



The plugin.xml for this snippet is attached

&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent"&gt;

Use the org.eclipse.ui.perspectiveExtensions extension point to define a newWizardShortcut entry for your new project wizard. 

Something like:

&lt;extension
     point="org.eclipse.ui.perspectiveExtensions"&gt;
  &lt;perspectiveExtension
        targetID="org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaPerspective"&gt;
     &lt;newWizardShortcut
           id="org.eclipse.jdt.junit.wizards.NewTestCaseCreationWizard"&gt;
     &lt;/newWizardShortcut&gt;
  &lt;/perspectiveExtension&gt;


You might have to do a 'reset perspective' to get the change picked up.

You can also set up these shortcuts in the 'Window /p/div

 * &lt;li&gt;a set of context senstive wizard shortcuts (as defined by

 * &lt;li&gt;a generic "Other" new wizard shortcut action&lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;

A "New" submenu for "Project Explorer" will allways be of this format so have to make my own implementation to add the project in the project group. Dear Greg thank you for your time. So iam off to creating an implementation of NewActionProvider as in https://cvalcarcel.wordpress.com/tag/commonwizard/
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The desired behaviour can be obtained when using the standard ResourceNavigator (
org.eclipse.ui.views.ResourceNavigator) view instead of the ProjectExplorer.  

In there the New-wizards will be automatically split up in project- and non-project wizards wheras former are automatically added in the same group as the Project... wizard (They are actually added above it no matter what menuGroupId is set).  

So if you want to properly achieve the behaviour stated in the question you have to either use the Navigator view or extend it.  

(I know that the question was asked specifically about the ProjectExplorer but nevertheless I think my answer might come to into use for someone with a similar problem)

I created a demo project here: https://github.com/confile/podExecTest

How can I tell eclipse where the PATH of this command is?
    

        
Title: Coderunner IDE auto-indent?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Using the Codeblocks IDE there is an option "Format use AStyle" to auto-indent my entire C++ code. I can't seem to find an option like this in Coderunner V2 for Mac and the web is pulling up nothing. Does anyone know if this option exists?
    

        
Title: CLion files out of scope, CMakeLists
Description: 
    
    
                    
My CLion doesn't seem to be working too well. Searching in whole project often results in: "usages are out of scope 'Project Files'". Similarly, most files appear to be grayed out, and the refactoring often does not understand certain pieces of my code are truly code.

This might something to do with the fact that all #includes use the &lt;/pp/pprecode/code/prep/p/div
