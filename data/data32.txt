I'm new to IntelliJ and I saw a start-up tip that said, "The ⎋ key in any tool window moves the focus to the editor."  However, I don't know what the ⎋ key is.  I've been programming a long time.  Is it possible there's a key on my keyboard that I've missed all these years?

Description: 
    
    
                    
I have Eclipse 4.2 (Juno) + PDT 3.1.1 freshly installed and i've selected PHP perspective. I've created empty "Test Project" PHP project and added "test.php" file to it. Now i want to run this file as PHP Script. But i simply don't have it in my "Run as..." context menu when i right click on "test.php" file. Please help. I am exhausted.

Additional information:


I have php5 installed on my PC and i can run .php files in my Windows command line window using "php filename.php" syntax.
I've tried same thing in so-called "All-in-one" Eclipse+PDT package. Same problem.

You don't need to "run" your PHP files through Eclipse (or any IDE, for that matter). You can just as easily debug by temporarily printing the values of variables you're trying to inspect to the page.  Just open your browser and navigate to the file (e.g.: localhost/[page]?[querystring]).

Remember, PHP is an interpreted language, not a compiled language (such as Java or C#) so you don't have to "run" it from anywhere in particular.  As long as your server is set up to process php files, you can view them through a browser.

Use the IDE for its code-completion features and to speed up development (as opposed to using a bare-bones text editor). Test in a browser.
    
    
Title: Identifying Views in the Visual Studio Tab List
Description: 
    
    
                    
In MVC you are likely to have many views with the same name (such as Index.cshtml or Edit.aspx) for the various controllers.

Depending on your working style, you might end up with a few tabs open in Visual Studio ending up with a tablist that looks like:

Index.cshtml|Index.cshtml|SomeController.cs|Edit.cshtml|Index.cshtml|Edit.cshtml|


It is possible to hover over the tabs and wait for the context hint to show up, but I was wondering if anyone had a technique or plugin where the correct file could be more easily identified at a glance (i.e. the Index.cshtml for the SomeController)?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There may be an extension in the Visual Studio 2010 Pro Power Tools that will make your life easier. The Document Well 2010 Plus allows you to configure the document tabs.

I think http://www.tabsstudio.com/ may have the behavior you are looking for.

When you install it you should open the 'Tabs Studio Add-in Manager' and check 'Disambiguator'.

When you have different files open with the same name, it will display it's containing folder.

Title: Is there an Eclipse plugin that will let you diff a single Java method across multiple Subversion revisions?
Description: 
    
    
                    
We're in the bug fix phase of a project.  I'm trying to fix a feature that regressed sometime in the last 2 months.  I think I have isolated the problem to a single Java class' method.  Ideally, I'd like compare how this method evolved over the last 5 or 10 Subversion commits.  

Are there any tools that understand Java and Subversion enough to visualize the evolution of a method across multiple commits?  I'm imagining an extension to the Subversive Eclipse plugin.

I'm looking for something beyond a line/character comparison.  Svn blame/show annotations doesn't understand that the text being analyzed is Java code which has methods.  Are there any tools which visualize with this type of understanding?

By all means, please try several different SVN clients: you might find something better for your needs than if you constrain yourself to Eclipse.

Here are a few options:

And I suspect you're already using this:

Here are some additional "tips and tricks" for using the Subclipse SVN client:

I've never seen anything that does exactly what you describe, but "svn blame" might help. For every line in a particular version, it shows the last revision where that that line was changed. This is called "Show Annotations" in Subclipse.
    
    
Title: Can&#39;t input unicode in python IDE (Mac OS X)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to collect some unicode raw_input in the default python IDE, and as far as I'm aware, it should be as simple as:

&gt;&gt;&gt; c = raw_input()
日本語
&gt;&gt;&gt; print c
日本語


However, when I try to input the unicode characters, the computer beeps some protestations and I end up with an empty string.  (To do this, I click on the IME switcher near the time and select the appropriate input method [which in this case is Japanese input).  Outside of the python IDE, the input works fine, I can input the characters and the system recognizes them as having been input.  In the IDE, I'll type some hiragana, and the drop-down kanji selection window appears as usual, but when I select the appropriate representation and hit enter, those beeps come and I wind up with nothing.  I figure there's a setting involved somewhere that I've missed.

versions are:

Python 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Jun 24 2010, 21:47:49) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin

neither of which work.  There's also this:

&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getdefaultencoding()
'ascii'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.stdin.encoding
'UTF-8'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.stdout.encoding
'UTF-8'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getfilesystemencoding()
'utf-8'


but from what I've read, the defaultencoding is a mysterious beast.  Changing it doesn't actually fix anything anyway.  That is, 

&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'setdefaultencoding'
&gt;&gt;&gt; reload(sys)
&lt;module 'sys' (built-in)&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')
&gt;&gt;&gt; # !!!
... c = raw_input()
no dice!


doesn't work.  Just more beeping.  I can't cut-and-paste Japanese text from other applications, either.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The defaultencoding shouldn't affect here. I had a similar problem and for me the solution was to check the Escape non-ASCII input option in Terminal 
Answer 2: 

    
    
I've had the same problem. In my case it turned out to be a libedit problem. I fixed it by installing readline -- which I had to do from source (from here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/readline) since using pip or easy_install, for whatever reason, didn't actually replace readline.

If you have ipython installed, it will tell you on startup if you're using libedit. And, if you have the same experience I did, you'll see the same problems in both the python interpreter in Terminal and in ipython. Once I got readline truly installed, and ipython no longer informed me that it was using libedit, the problems with entering Unicode disappeared in both python and ipython.

(Note: I also have bpython installed -- and, since it doesn't seem to use readline or libedit, but rather its own line-editing routines, entering Unicode in bpython always worked.)
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Edit: I tried Python from the command line (Terminal), and it does not work, and I get the beeps you are talking about.  It doesn't seem to be a Terminal limitation, as I can paste the characters at the $ prompt in bash just fine.  It does work in Idle, as I show below.

Edit #2: Interestingly, this one-liner does work:

 $ python -c "exec(\"c=raw_input()\nprint c\")"

Try this:

import codecs, sys
sys.stdin = codecs.getreader('UTF-8')(sys.stdin)
sys.stdout = codecs.getwriter('UTF-8')(sys.stdout)
sys.stderr = codecs.getwriter('UTF-8')(sys.stderr)

print u'\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e'


This works for me for non-ASCII characters when using Putty with the terminal encoding set to UTF-8.  I see boxes because I do not have fonts for CJK characters installed, but I think this should do it for you.

The reason this works is that by default the Python interpreter uses the 'ascii' codec for stdin, stdout and stderr.  And because ASCII only defines byte values 0 to 127, only those byte values can be printed.

In fact it is disabled on each cell except the cell that is coming under a group.

The person is using Italian IDE (Visual Studio) whereas my IDE is in english. Is there any difference between these two?

I had the same problem. I think the problem is if the field is not recognised as a numeric, then 'Add Total' field will be disabled. So to overcome this problem, first I inserted a row at the bottom of the table and then  I converted the field into double in the expression as follows

After running the report, I was able to see expected total.

It's worth noting that if you tried Aptana in the past and didn't like their developed-in-house php editor, they've now dropped it in favor of PDT.

I've used Aptana for a while now for some large-project development, and I've not yet found anything missing.

Title: Developing with Wildfly Swarm in IDE without restarts - &ldquo;hot deploy&rdquo; somewhere?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm interested in the Wildfly Swarm project to create fat-jar JavaEE application but can't figure out how to "hot deploy" changed classes from the IDE.

Whenever I change a line of code or a JSF xhtml file I currently have to restart the whole application which takes 7s or so. That's not very productive.

Spring Boot offers a spring-boot-devtools that reloads at least some classes,
traditional app servers offer hot-deploy protocols. Is there anything similar for Wildfly Swarm? Would JRebel help here?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can run WildFly Swarm as a Java Application directly from sources in your favorite IDE, by calling your own Main class or the org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm class. This saves you the packaging step.

As for hot class reloading, as usual, the JVM will be able to reload non-structural changes, but will have to be restarted whenever you "break" a class signature. I haven't tried it but it's very likely JRebel might be able to help there.

If you're an Eclipse user, you can give wildfly-hive a try. It tries to autodetect swarm apps and creates matching servers in the servers view. You just have to click start/debug/stop, similar to standard servers in Eclipse.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
My solution was to use IntelliJ IDEA and create an exploded WAR artifact from my sources. Don't include any of the WildFly Swarm dependencies, but do include everything else. 

Then you can use regular old WildFly Standalone with the JBoss run configuration, and IntelliJ will deploy the exploded war. From there you can hot swap, debug, etc.

For development, run your code on WildFly Standalone. For production, use the WildFly Swarm jar. This works perfectly for me, and I've been using this method for months without many problems.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I know it's a bit late but when using IntelliJ IDEA we are using the org.wildfly.swarm.Swarm class, which can be started from the IDE and it gives you the ability to hot reload classes in Debug mode. You can make a run config with that, make sure you set the Working directory and the Use classpath of module configs.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I would suggest using IntelliJ Idea. Its JavaEE project template work with hot deploy on most application servers.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Emacs on a virtualenv project with Cython files, and that means that most of the files are not ones I'm editing.  In particular, I don't want anything from the user subdir in the project.  So far no problems -- -/usr works in the .projectile file.  Now I want no .c files.  That doesn't work.  the documentation says that I should put -*.c in the .projectile file.  That doesn't work.  Neither does -/foo/bar/*.c, nor any other permutation I can think of.  Also, when the items in the .projectile file have slashes, the find command prints lots of warnings about paths with slashes.   Is there an Emacs Lisp way to do things that's better?  Or am I just missing something?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you do not enable "native indexing" (which is I believe disabled by default), Projectile ignores the contents of .projectile and uses .gitignore.

So either put (setq projectile-indexing-method 'native) in your .emacs file or populate .gitignore.
    
    
Title: Who paints TTimer at design time?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Who paints TTimer at design time ?

When using the Delphi IDE's form designer, when you drop a TTimer on the form, the component is visible at design time (but, of course, non-visual at runtime).

The TTimer class is defined in unit ExtCtrls, so of course I did read the TTimer source code in that unit.

I was expecting to see something like this:

procedure TTimer.Paint;
begin
  if csDesigning in ComponentState then
    with Canvas do
    begin
      // Paint the design-time appearance of TTimer here:

      // ... code ...

    end else begin end; // no painting at runtime.
end;


But I was surprised to see no such code!

The TTimer component has this private field: FWindowHandle: HWND;, but that is only used to receive the WM_Timer message from windows itself. It is not used to paint anything, even at design time. And no canvas either.

While reading the TTimer source code, I could not find anything related to design time painting.

So the question is: what code and where is responsible to paint the TTimer's design time appearance on the form in the form designer of the Delphi IDE itself.

Now, if someone wonders why I ask this question, here's some information about that:

Elsewhere on StackOverflow someone asked if it is possible to load a .dfm file at runtime. Someone answered: "No, it is not possible".

But that is not exactly true. I have written some code to do exactly this: load "someform.dfm" from disk and create such form at runtime. That is possible, but the nuisance is that then you need to write code like this:

procedure RegisterNecessaryClasses;
begin
  RegisterClass(TfrmDynaForm);
  RegisterClass(TPanel);
  RegisterClass(TMemo);
  RegisterClass(TTimer);
  RegisterClass(TListBox);
  RegisterClass(TSplitter);
  RegisterClass(TEdit);
  RegisterClass(TCheckBox);
  RegisterClass(TButton);
  RegisterClass(TLabel);
  RegisterClass(TRadioGroup);
end;


This is just a first example that lets me load and present one particular form without errors. But, as soon as some other form contains, for example: TSpeedbutton, then the above procedure needs to be edited to add this line:

  RegisterClass(TSpeedbutton);


Skip that, and you'll have a "class Txxx not found" -exception.

Another problem is that even after I added code to find any TTimer components in the dfm to load, and I manually have set csDesigning in the ComponentState of that TTimer instance, the TTimer still stays invisible.

So what (else) do I need to do to make the TTimer visible the same way it is visible in the Delphi IDE's form designer?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Non-visual components have no Paint method and so are not capable of painting themselves. 


  Who paints TTimer at design time?


The IDE paints the representation of non-visual components. 


  So what (else) do I need to do to make the TTimer visible the same way it is visible in the Delphi IDE's form designer?


You have to paint it in your code. Non-visual components will not paint themselves. 
    
    
Title: Eclipse inserting arg0, arg1 etc. instead of proper parameter names when overriding Android methods
Description: 
    
    
                    
When I override methods from the Android classes in Eclipse, I get useless parameter names like "arg0", "arg1" etc. For example when overriding methods from SQLiteOpenHelper I get:

@Override
public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase arg0) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
}

@Override
public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase arg0, int arg1, int arg2) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
}


I've found various posts about this but none of the accepted solutions seem to work for me. It is also strange because it only seems to happen some of the time. For example the constructors in the above test had correctly named parameters.

I have got "Documentation for Android SDK" installed in the Android SDK Manager for Android 4.4.2. Do I still need to manually attach the docs (or even source?) somehow for this to work reliably, and if so how do I go about this?

As @greg-449 mentioned in the comments, the Android source needs to be attached for this to work.

Following the steps in this link seems to fix this.

In case the link is broken in future, the steps are: 


Download "Sources for Android SDK" using the SDK Manager
Right click android.jar in the Eclipse Package Explorer (under the Android {version} node), and click properties
Under "Java Source Attachment", enter the path to the downloaded source directory which is along the lines of {sdk}/sources/android-{version}


I then get this:

@Override
public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
}

@Override
public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
}


UPDATE: For reference, a similar problem occurs in Android Studio (v0.4.2 at the time of writing). Sources can be attached via File -

I don't know if this is still the case for Visual Studio 2010, but you could have this same scenario in Visual Studio 2008. When breaking off a unit test run (i.e. when detecting erroneous code while debugging a unit test) it would leave a process running.

The process that is hindering execution for Visual Studio 2008 and has to be killed to be able to unit test again is VSPerfMon.exe. Might be wort a look for VS2010.

I know this question was asked long before .NET 4.5, but I've found that I get this error on VS2010 after installing .NET 4.5.  

A "solution" (not the most helpful one - I know) is obviously to uninstall .NET 4.5.  I guess / hope there will be an update to Visual Studio 2010 at some point to resolve this.

UPDATE

I had a similar error, when trying to run tests which used TypeMock.  In order to solve the problem I opened up my solution in Visual Studio and selected Test - Edit Test Settings.  In the Test Settings dialog I selected Hosts and switched it to Run tests in 64 bit process on 64 bit machine.

This is possibly because you have previously run your tests and stopped them before they completed (possibly because you were debugging and you hit a breakpoint) leaving the test agent process still running, you are then unable to start a second instance. The name of the process escapes me at the moment but if find the process in task manager and kill it off, this will hopefully solve your problem.

Use Pycharm https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ 
Get Community version, because it is free with debugger and autocomplete. (more than enough for student) 

To get autocomplete and run/debug the code on Pycharm IDE, you have to set correct project interpreter path to your environment (or virtual environment) which you install pytorch  

The screenshot shows that I set Project Interpreter path to conda environment named 'pytorch', which I install Pytorch.

Both Spyder and PyCharm have auto-complete feature for the installed libraries. But this feature does not seem to work for the local project files (functions, classes, variables defined in the local files even if they are imported).

They also have "go to definition" and "help", but again, only for the installed libraries.

I hope these features will be included soon, in addition to "references to this variable/function/class", which is available in advanced IDEs and is quite useful.

add template name, description, don't care for icon or image so leave blank.
finish, then create a project using the above template.


Now I have a zip folder in my exported templates containing the template we named above (we'll just say project template). The problem is, when I create a new project using this template, the .h and .cpp files are referenced in the solution explorer, but they do not exist:


And if I try clicking on driver.cpp or driver.h, I get the following error


But if I paste in the driver.h and driver.cpp files into this location, they work


It defeats the purpose of having a template if I have to paste in the files for this to work, why is it that these files are missing and yet exist in file explorer?

The only easiest way I know is using OneNote (I am using OneNote 2013) - 
You have a shortcut for screen clipping (Windows + N, S).


Take a snapshot - send/copy it to OneNote.
Right-click on the image and click "Copy Text from Picture"
Paste the copied text into OneNote or in a notepad (you don't really need notepad, if you have OneNote ;-))


The bonus is, you may not need to save it to a text file. OneNote can search through text within images and index it for your search within OneNote.

It's a pity the text can't be copied directly.

Two caveats though:


You may have to drag open the docked window, so most or all of the text can be snapped. It is much more painful especially with CodeLens Test Status.
Because this method is using an OCR scanner of an image (within OneNote), you may not have everything perfectly in text. I had better results with lighter backgrounds (VS Environment Theme - Light).

As @NullPointerWizard pointed out in a comment:

The Results window allows to you select and copy the lines directly as text (Ctrl+C or Right-click &gt; Copy). This not only avoids workarounds like OCR but allows for copying all the results (possibly several screen lengths) simultaneously.

Title: Are there any Haskell specific tools that can show source code from imported modules?
Description: 
    
    
                    
How can I browse Haskell source code preferably without internet connection? Right now I click through hackage search results, click source link and search the source page. There are two problems:


I'm using current version as a proxy of what I have locally
This does not work recursively well (another clicks and searches for next definition)


Usually IDEs let you download sources for any library and open new editor tab with definition. I prefer reading code than documentation, less surprises along the way and I can learn something from them.

So, how can I setup for recursive source searches using Haskell tools or standard GNU tools if necessary? All I know right now is that I can generate ctags for vim but where does cabal store sources?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is the opinionated workflow I follow to render the documentation with the source link enabled.

$ cd &lt;package-name&gt;
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal install --only-dependencies --enable-documentation --haddock-hyperlink-source
$ cabal configure --enable-documentation --haddock-hyperlink-source
$ cabal haddock --hyperlink-source
$ firefox dist/doc/html/&lt;package-name&gt;/index.html


The Source link should be enabled for all packages, including the dependencies, as long as they are installed in the sandbox.

In the particular case of Arch Linux, the distro I use, I try to avoid installing Haskell system packages through pacman because, by default, the documentation is not built with the source link enabled. In Arch Linux you can use ABS and modify the PKGBUILD with the parameters described above. I'm pretty sure something similar could be done in other distros, but have no idea about Windows or Mac OS X.

It's also worth mentioning that you don't need to type those parameters every time you run cabal. You can enable them by default in your .cabal/config

This should work without the sandbox but if you are dealing with more than one Haskell project I strongly recommend to use sandboxes.

I'm looking for a tool for HTML5 + CSS3 editing. Currently the best IDE I have found is Visual Studio 2012. There is one slight problem. I want to have a live preview of what I'm creating. I have multiple monitors and it would be perfect to see the result of my code without switching to browser and hitting F5 (or Ctrl+F5). The only way I could achieve this is by using a auto-reload addon on Firefox or Chrome. But it isn't a very elegant solution. It can pretty much slow down the process because it runs so many unnecessary refreshes.

The best solution would be to somehow do this in browser (or a tool which uses browser engines) to test it in various browsers. Also it helps in situations that I'm developing server-side in PHP or ASP.NET.

Alternatively, if there is a very good IDE (better than VS) I wouldn't mind using it but please note, I'm looking for these:


Live preview (of course)
Intellisense
Auto-complete features (for instance closing tags, quotations, etc.)

Indentation in VIM (and in any other editor or IDE) is carried on by indentation rules coded by someone. There is no guarantee that any two system will follow same indentation practice, since there are different indentation practices around. 

I also use VIM for minor editing Java files, and I'm not aware of any common alternative indentation script for Java, other than the one included in the official distribution. I you're familiar with VIM scripting you can try to edit the indentation script to your needs. It resides at $VIMRUNTIME/indent/java.vim.

By the way your example is a little uncommon. Using curly braces for cases of a switch statement is unnecessary. I guess VIM indentation scripts indent blocks by considering the block type and gets confused with this kind of uncommon blocks. Netbeans also get a little confused with this example, it aligns the case blocks in a reasonable way, but the closing curly brace of switch statement is completely out of alignment. That kind of odd behavior will not be so common with default VIM indentation. Actually if you remove the curly braces of the case statements VIM indentation aligns the statements quite well.

Eclipse and Visual Studio have plugins for just about everything. Eclipse is free, I think for Visual Studio though you'd have to get the professional version to run plugins...
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
NetBeans - If you are using 64-bit Windows do not hurry to install updates on 7.0+. 6.* is working fine.

You have ftp and you can set to upload on run of the project or on each save. You can download Python plugin by adding this url. It is not the best but it worked for me.

It is stable engough and powerful, since the eclipses are very buggy to me.

Aptana is currently the eclipse for web projects, and the people who are creating it are also the creators of pydev, so it would be my second choise.

Visual Studio's plugin VC.Php (Paid) is also powerful, because Visual Studio environment is good, but the plugin is buggy, too and sometimes seems to be updated with dalay of new suff, as whole it would be my 3rd choise.
    
    
Title: Selenium IDE - Typing values stored in an array into a textbox?
Description: 
    
    
                    
There's a webpage I'm trying to test that has multiple textboxes.  I've gotten to the point where I can retrieve all the values in every textbox and store them into an array, but I'm stuck on how to type those same values into the textboxes again.

Here's what I have so far in Selenium:


Larger view: http://i.stack.imgur.com/rb93k.png

The stored variable 'count' is simply the number of rows in the table, and isn't causing a problem.  The part I've circled in red is where the problem comes in.

When I run this test, instead of typing the value stored in the array at that index, it simply types:



This continues all the way until the end.

The variable 'i' is properly inserted, but for some reason instead of grabbing that value, it simply types it into the textbox.

Does anyone know how I can get the correct value in the array?

Below is the problematic line:

type | javascript{this.browserbot.getUserWindow().getTestingHooks('TextBoxValue_' + storedVars['i'])} | ${textBoxArray[${i}]} | 

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
i'm using Selenium library through Robot Tests Framework. I'm not using any IDE, just using HTML to make test cases and defining new keywords.

When ever i want to access a list variable item, i just use the following sintaxe

@{list_variable_name}[0]

note that ${variable_name} is to access a single value variable or the reference to the list variable. If we want to access a list item we need to use @ instead of $.

If i understand your situation right, 
@{textBoxArray}[${i}] should work for you.

Try also
${textBoxArray}[${i}] because it seems that your are simply misplaycing the last }.

Answer 2: 

    
    
I think you need to replace your circled reference to ${textBoxArray[${i}] with

javascript{storedVars['textBoxArray['+storedVars['j']+']']}


Read this blog post for more information, especially the section about 'Setting and getting variables'.

Quoting from the article, consider

store | 10 | x



  This obviously sets x=10. There are a couple of ways to reference it:
  ${x} or storedVars['x']. They're not the same.


In particular


  You can't assign anything to ${x}. 

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You can insert one more command before your problematic line:

getEval | storedVars['text'] = storedVars['textBoxArray'][storedVars['i']];


And change problematic line to:

type | javascript{this.browserbot.getUserWindow().getTestingHooks('TextBoxValue_' + storedVars['i'])} | ${text} 


Also it will be probably helpful to declare your array in the beginning of the test:

storeEval | new Array() | textBoxArray

    
    
Title: Disabling the form designer in DelphiXE
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is it possible to disable the form designer in DelphiXE "on-demand/selectively" and only work with the code of a form/class where needed, in the event that controls are not installed in the IDE?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'd say the answer is no, but the workaround that I use is to edit the DFM file and cut out the component that is not there, and paste it to the FormCreate event and instantiate it there instead. The properties are all there in the DFM, so a little editing makes it work nicely.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
No you can't disable it selectively. What I often do (as I have hardly any controls installed in most of my IDE's) is that I just open the form, tell Delphi to ignore all errors when loading the dfm, do my editing of the source code and make sure I don't check in the dfm to my source control system.

You could try to keep the dfm readonly to avoid mistakenly checking in a dfm with deleted controls, but there is a drawback to that: every time you try to save your source the IDE will come up with an error about the readonly-ness of the file. If you hit Ctrl-S or Shft-Ctrl-S as often as I do, that quickly becomes a nuisance. 

When I do have to change the dfm, I do it in text mode, or install the controls, do the dfm changes and submit. After that I am free again to de-install the controls and just work on the pas file, ignoring / reverting any changes to the dfm.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
No, and there is no reasonable workaround for it at this time.

I have asked for this to be a feature in Delphi at some point in the future; That DFMs should not be destroyed by opening them, nor should multiple modal dialog boxes asking if you want to destroy your DFMs be the default behaviour when opening a form that does not have the controls installed.

In the end there is only one practical solution; Install all the controls.  Anything else is just going to drive you crazy.
    
    
Title: How can I add PHP support to Visual Studio 2010?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I don't like splitting up my development environments, but I build projects for clients who use both .NET systems and Apache-based systems.  This means I am forced to split my time between Visual Studio for the .NET and Dreamweaver or another IDE for the PHP-based work.  I don't want to use two IDEs - I'd much rather build everything in one.

I prefer VS for its intellisense support.  It's also easier to track down bugs in JavaScript used between two different projects when the syntax coloring is consistent - every IDE colors text slightly differently, making the same file look different in each environment.

Aside from VS.Php, what solutions exist for adding PHP support to the Visual Studio IDE?  VS.Php looks promising, but I don't want to shell out any cash for something that may or may not satisfy my need.  Since PHP itself is free, I'm wondering if anyone's bothered to build a free extension that offers the same support.  Is this possible?  Or should I just bite the bullet and go with VS.Php?

Title: How to &ldquo;force&rdquo; a file&#39;s ISO-8859-1ness?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I remember when I used to develop website in Japan - where there are three different character encodings in currency - the developers had a trick to "force" the encoding of a source file so it would always open in their IDEs in the correct encoding.

What they did was to put a comment at the top of the file containing a Japanese character that only existed in that particular character encoding - it wasn't in any of the others! This worked perfectly.

I remember this because now I have a similar, albeit Anglophone, problem.

I've got some files that MUST be ISO-8859-1 but keep opening in my editor (Bluefish 1.0.7 on Linux) as UTF-8. This isn't normally a problem EXCEPT for pound (£) symbols and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, I can fix the file and save it out again as ISO-8859-1, but I want it to always open as ISO-8859-1 in my editor.

So, are there any sort of character hacks - like I mention above - to do this? Or any other methods?

PS. Unicode advocates / evangelists needn't waste their time trying to convert me because I'm already one of them! This is a rickety older system I've inherited :-(

PPS. Please don't say "use a different editor" because I'm an old fart and set in my ways :-)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Normally, if you have a £ encoded as ISO-8859-1 (ie. a single byte 0xA3), that's not going to form part of a valid UTF-8 byte sequence, unless you're unlucky and it comes right after another top-bit-set character in such a way to make them work together as a UTF-8 sequence. (You could guard against that by putting a £ on its own at the top of the file.)

So no editor should open any such file as UTF-8; if it did, it'd lose the £ completely. If your editor does that, “use a different editor”—seriously! If your problem is that your editor is loading files that don't contain £ or any other non-ASCII character as UTF-8, causing any new £ you add to them to be saved as UTF-8 afterwards, then again, simply adding a £ character on its own to the top of the file should certainly stop that.

What you can't necessarily do is make the editor load it as ISO-8859-1 as opposed to any other character set where all single top-bit-set bytes are valid. It's only multibyte encodings like UTF-8 and Shift-JIS which you can exclude them by using byte sequences that are invalid for that encoding.

What will usually happen on Windows is that the editor will load the file using the system default code page, typically 1252 on a Western machine. (Not actually quite the same as ISO-8859-1, but close.)

Some editors have a feature where you can give them a hint what encoding to use with a comment in the first line, eg. for vim:

# vim: set fileencoding=iso-8859-1 :


The syntax will vary from editor to editor/configuration. But it's usually pretty ugly. Other controls may exist to change default encodings on a directory basis, but since we don't know what you're using...

In the long run, files stored as ISO-8859-1 or any other encoding that isn't UTF-8 need to go away and die, of course. :-)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can put character ÿ (0xFF) in the file. It's invalid in UTF8. BBEdit on Mac correctly identifies it as ISO-8859-1. Not sure how your editor of choice will do.

Although it's interesting to hear about free licences for proprietary software, my question is really about Open Source Applications.  

Background: I normally maintain that when looking for software for software development, OSS is the first port of call, as developers quite like "eating their own dog food".

Object Browser - Allow users to see all the data and function objects that are available, including those in loaded and installed R packages.  Context menus provide the capability to quickly edit and plot data or load a package.

Full-featured Visual Debugger - Debug R scripts, with step-in, step-over, and step-out capability, allowing users to inspect and modify R objects as they are debugging

A Visual Solution Explorer - Organize, view, add, remove, rearrange, and deploy R scripts. Users can create their own Project Templates for automatic creation of a set of customized scripts for a new R project. Dockable, Floating, and Tabbed Tool Windows. for Creating personally customized workspaces.

Enhanced Help - Complete search capabilities and hover-over tooltips for functions and data objects.

R Code Snippets - Automatically generate fill-in-the-blank sections of R code for a variety of analyses. Tooltip help gives guidance in filling out the snippet.

Well my experiences with that are devastating. ProjectCenter the IDE distributed for GNUstep does not work here at all the debugger intergration is well not existant. But that's what you get with GNUstep. There is Gorm as interface builder and ProjectCenter. Not more. That's very discouraging. The best you can do with Objective-C is currently having a Mac in some form and use XCode. That's the best you can get currently, and I expect that won't change in any forseeable future.

Now you should step back and just use the "plain" old Makefile route. There is a somewhat very rough tutorial about GNUStep makefile starting somewhere below

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow, QPushButton, QApplication

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)

    mainWindow.show()
    app.exec_() 


I have a number of questions. I don't know if they are all related (I guess so), so forgive me if they are not.


When I run the above code from the terminal, all is fine. The program runs, if I click the button it prints the traceback and dies. If I run it inside an IDE (I tested Spyder and PyCharm), the traceback is not displayed. Any idea why? Essentially the same question was raised in other posts also on SO, here and here. Please don't mark this as a duplicate of either of those; please read on.
By adding the commented lines, the traceback is again displayed properly. However, they also have the nasty side effect that the app does no longer terminate on unhandled exceptions! I have no idea why this happens, as AFAIK excepthook only prints the traceback, it cannot prevent the program from exiting. At the moment it is called, it's too late for rescue.
Also, I don't understand how Qt comes into play here, as exceptions that are not thrown inside a slot still crash the app as I would expect. No matter if I change excepthook or not, PyQt does not seem to override it as well (at least the print seems to suggest so).


FYI, I am using Python 3.5 with PyQt 5.6, and I am aware of the changes in the exception handling introduced in PyQt 5.5. If those are indeed the cause for the behaviour above, I would be glad hear some more detailed explanations.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
When an exception happens inside a Qt slot, it's C++ which called into your Python code. Since Qt/C++ know nothing about Python exceptions, you only have two possibilities:


Print the exception and return some default value to C++ (like 0, "" or NULL), possibly with unintended side effects. This is what PyQt &lt; 5.5 does.
Print the exception and then call qFatal() or abort(), causing the application to immediately exit inside C++. That's what PyQt /li/ulpcode/code/p/div

You can try Eclipse (its Python IDE is PyDev), along with the Remote System Explorer plugin which, I believe, is included by default.

For instructions specific to Amazon AWS, see this blog.

During that process, you may have to create a new 'parent profile', that is not mentioned in that blog.

Also, once the connection is all set up, you can create a remote file from within your local eclipse's RSE but any edits to make to a file (newly created or already existing remotely) may not be reflected in the remote system by default - they are instead stored locally under RemoteSystemsTempFiles. So, you would have to 'Export From Project' and select the locally edited file(s) that you want reflected on the remote system.

I checked the C:/go directory to make everything there is correct and it was. Also I'm using 64bit windows 7 and double checked that as well.

While I have not tested this in Windows 7, on Windows 10, these were the steps that I took to make LiteIDE work


Installed Go to C:\Go
Added C:\Go\bin to PATH and made sure go was working from Command Line
This was the most important step for me. Defined GOPATH in an environment variable. In my case, it was C:\Users\vivek\Documents\Source\Go. I also made sure that there were three folders src, pkg and bin were created in GOPATH. At this point go env was showing me correct values for GOPATH and GOROOT. go get, go build and go install was working as well at this step.
Downloaded and unzipped LiteIDE to C:\liteide. Started LiteIDE and it worked out of the box for me. Make sure that GOPATH is seen correctly by LiteIDE by going to View &gt; Manage GOPATH


Hope this helps. Good luck.

It's not a good idea to keep your projects in the GOROOT path, which per default (when installed using the MSI installer) is C:\Go. Always keep it separated from there. It also helps to avoid issues with updates.

Since Go projects are made up of packages which are organized in directory structures it is important to follow a few rules and keep the working space for your Go projects separated and clean.

In my opinion its best practice to create ONE working directory as the root for ALL your Go projects somewhere in your user space and stick to it. 

One way to do this is to create a directory like "work" and set the environment variable GOPATH to it (e.g. C:\Users\Peter\Documents\work). Make sure to relog or restart your computer after your changes.

Upon certain operations Go will automatically create the directories bin, pkg and src below your GOPATH. 


src contains your created or downloaded Go source files,  
pkg contains your installed package objects, and  
bin contains your installed executable files.


bin or pkg will automatically be created when you use the go install command to install a binary executable or a package. It's important to understand that these are files that are not part of the Go installation. 

src, if it does not yet exist, will automatically be created the first time you issue a go get command or in case of LiteIDE, the first time you create a new Go1 Command Project or Go1 Package Project. Watch the "Location:" field on the dialog box, it should include your path defined in GOPATH followed by \src (e.g. C:\Users\Peter\Documents\work\src).

In the name field enter the path you want to use for your project. If you plan to track the development of your project on Github (or other repo) it's common practice to include the path to the Git repo in your source path (e.g. github.com/petergloor/hello-go).

Of course you can use any other structure to organize your projects as long you make sure they fall below the src directory in your GOPATH.

For more information about Go workspaces read https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces.

A final note about the GOROOT environment variable. Dont explicitly set this if you install Go in C:\Go. It's enough to include C:\Go\bin in your path and to set GOPATH. GOROOT is only needed in case Go is installed at another location.

You have to setup LiteIDE variables correctly (if there are not by default).
Please, check two options:


Go to Settings → "Manage GOPATH" 
Options → LiteEnv (there are
environment definitions files). Just double click on someone and
setup Go environment variables.

I'm not sure how this works, but it worked in my case. I got this idea from this video on Youtube-Chris Hawkes


Open LiteIDE.
Click File---New.
Select "Go1 Command Project".
Browse the desired path.
Select the desired folder.
Name the folder and click Ok.
Now, you will be able to see a "main.go" file opened in the IDE.
Write whatever code you want to run in this file with correct syntax, it will run.


The only problem with this is, whenever I create another ".go" source code file in the same folder, the same error is shown. So, you might have to edit this file every time, you try to write new code.

Title: Visual Studio SQL Server design and inline editing features missing
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Visual Studio 2012 I have two database connections configured in the Server Explorer. One is for a SQL Server 2008 R2 database, the other is for a SQL Server 2012 database. I've always been able to make quick inline edits to the data with SQL 2008 databases by right clicking on the table and selecting "Show Table Data".



I could then pop open the SQL pane and query the data, put a cursor directly in the field and edit the data in the result set. I relied on this method heavily when making quick edits to the data without the need to script.



It seems this option is not available for SQL Server 2012 connections. When I try to do the same it seems to open in the context of SQL Server Database Tools (SSDT). I will see an initial result set of 1000 records but unlike SQL 2008 no way simple way to run a more precise SELECT query and edit data inline by selecting and overwriting values in the result set. The screenshot below is the closest I can get by directly opening the new query window, but still no way to inline edit the results.



Is it possible to get the 2012 database to behave like the 2008 database in Visual Studio? Did I miss a component on the installation of SQL 2012 that is preventing this behaviour? Or has Microsofts pulled these features away? I desperately want to get inline editing back, I don't want to have to write UPDATE queries to correct single lines of data, it's slower and it seems riskier.. if a clause is inadvertently missed it could end up corrupting a lot of data?

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
First, clear the query limits in the settings. This is under Tools menu, then Options, and scroll to "SQL Server Object Explorer" and "Commands"

Then, right click the table and click "Edit All Rows"

Then show the SQL pane and you can then edit the query. It is the icon that has the letters SQL in a square background. Not the icon with SQL on top of a cylinder.

I'd post pictures, but I don't have enough points, ridiculously. So sorry me. Message me if you want them.
    
    
Title: How to Disable Toggle Open Documents in NetBeans?
Description: 
    
    
                    
NetBeans (7) is very nice for letting you customize your keyboard shortcuts.

Personally, I want ctrl-tab to switch to the tab to the right and ctrl-shift-tab to switch left, but at the moment these launch the annoying Toggle Between Open Documents popup:



I have already set my keyboard shortcuts to have "next tab" using the workaround for getting the tab in there described here, but the Toggle Open Documents behavior is not configurable from that menu and is overriding my shortcut.



:(?

*PS: No desire to switch my whole key bindings over to another profile.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Using Netbeans 7.2, I find that after configuring the shortcuts as per your screenshots briefly pressing CTRL+TAB switches to the tab to the right, and pressing CTRL+SHIFT+TAB briefly switches to the tab to the left.
The annoying popup thing only appears if you press and hold these buttons.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I claim it cannot be done, because if it could be then someone on SO would know how to do it.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
It looks like this is still impossible in Netbeans 7.3.1. The tab switcher appears to be hard-coded to Ctrl + Tab.

As a workaround, Ctrl + Pg Dn or Ctrl + Pg Up in turn appear to be hard-coded to the next tab and previous tab actions.
    
    
Title: What are the steps I need to follow to be able to write and edit python programs on my Android phone?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm a beginner, with programming and Python. 

What I want to do is read and follow examples in books like 'Learn Python the Hard way' and 'Hello world: computer programmming for kids and others'.  

I want to be able to do the example problems on my android (xperia arc) phone while I'm taking the bus and the train. The train goes through tunnels so this needs to work without internet. That means repl.it and ideone won't work (i think).

So far I have installed the SL4A scripting layer (I think - not sure how to check to make sure it's working) and I've installed P4A (python for android). What else do I need to be able to get a terminal/shell window?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I've used SL4A for Python scripting quite a bit in the past, and it works very well with most of the standard modules. Once you've installed the SL4A app and the interpreters (P4A in this case), you can start writing python files right on the device.

The User Guide on the SL4A website does a pretty good job of introducing the basic concepts for using it: http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/wiki/UserGuide. You can create a new .py script within the main menu. FWIW, you dont have to have a seperate "terminal/shell" to start scripts... you can launch them from within SL4A or even create shortcuts to launch them from home screen.

If you're not sure if the interpreter installed, try following this: http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/wiki/InstallingInterpreters

** EDIT ** : If you're not sure if A4P got installed correctly, you can launch the app (Python for Android) on your device, and it will tell you the version of the interpreter installed, and how many scripts are currently loaded. You can also uninstall / re-install from there.

For what its worth, if you're just getting started with Python (and programming in general), I'd recommend trying to get some of the examples working on a desktop machine, just so you can get the knack of the language. If you use standard libraries, you can copy your scripts to your android device, and run them within P4A. "helloWorld.py" ports very easily ;-)

In the vein of the https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8440/visual-studio-optimizations Question, I would love to collect tips and tricks to make XCode4 go faster in day to day use.

Especially, I'm interested in ways to disable annoying UI animations, improve build times and getting apps under the debugger faster. Tips that reduce XCode's memory footprint as well as improve startup times are appreciated.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There are a collection of tiny XCode plugins that can be found here, which allow for many of XCode's more annoying (and often distracting) features to be disabled (including the "annoying UI animations" you mentioned).

Detailed instructions for the plugins and installation process can be found here.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    

Disable indexing (this will considerably reduce the amount of ram and CPU XCode uses)

$ defaults write com.apple.dt.XCode IDEIndexDisable 1
Reduce XCode's priority (this will allow you to do other things while building)

$ renice 10 -p PID (Where PID is XCode's Process ID )
Avoid dependency checks on every build (this will make builds faster)

    
    
Title: How to set Eclipse watchpoint to activate when object/primitive changes?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to refactor some rather horrible code at the moment.  It's passing around objects in a very convoluted manner I can't keep track of and apparently directly accessing primitives within the objects at some other location in the code.  I'm trying to figure out how I can use the debugger to find out when/where an object I'm interested in is used after it gets passed into the confusing black box of code which passes these objects.

What I would like is a way to set a watchpoints that breaks when an Object (or primitive) is modified.  I know that watchpoints can be set on variables, but this isn't what I want.  The variable pointing to the object I'm interested in disappears at the end of the function call, I want a way to continue to track the object after this function returns.

Can anyone tell me if Eclipse has this functionality?  I'm using Helios.

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can set a watchpoint on each field of the class you are interested in.

Alternatively, you can find all places in the source referring a certain field by using the call hierarchy (click on the field, and press Ctrl-Alt-H). This has the advantage that you are not only finding where the field is accessed in a particular execution of the program, but for all possible executions.

Note that neither method will notice if the field is accessed using reflection.
