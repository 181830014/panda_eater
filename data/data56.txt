Title: Where to migrate existing Visual Web Project in Netbeans to?
Description: 
    
    
                    
We currently maintain a JSF application developed using Netbeans 5.5.1 using the Visual Web Designer. Our environment is forcing us to stop using Netbeans 5.5.1 and we now have to find another tool to develop our application in.

The problem is that migrating to Netbeans 6.7 we will lose the Visual Web Designer we have grown so accustomed to when working on our application. Netbeans suggest moving to IceFaces, but there will still be no Visual Web Designer and will be all text based.
See here.

We tried the backwards compatibility plug-in for Visual Web Designer projects. Unfortunately many components and custom javascript used in the application still does not work.

So we are going to have to do a lot of work no matter what direction we go. So my question is, what is the recommended tool set used for developing/maintaining a JSF application? Should we stick with Netbeans, is Eclipse better for this, is there something else I have not considered?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
After looking into all our options we decided to upgrade to Netbeans 6.5 and start migrating the project IceFaces. With IceFaces you can have a project that has both IceFaces and Woodstock screens. So we can upgrade one screen at a time and not have to do everything at once. Once they are all changed over, we will clean up and remove the Woostock stuff. Then once it is a pure Icefaces project we can swap development environments if we want to at that time. 

It was the best solution we could find to both upgrade our IDE and keep the a visual designer. IF you find something better be sure to post it here also, as we are always looking for a better solution.

In addition to Netbeans and Eclipse, there's IntelliJ (though that doesn't have a visual component) and JDeveloper from Oracle.

Can't recommend JDeveloper especially, as I haven't used it (visual development isn't something I like), but it's free, and the demos that I've seen (on the referenced page) make it look like something that may fit your needs better than Eclipse.
    
    
Title: Any way to change colour of the Code Insight red &#39;underline&#39; in Delphi2007 IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I hope the question says it all, really. I use the old Turbo Pascal type colours (navy blue background and white, yellow text etc) in all my Delphi IDEs, including D2007. I'm sufficiently colourblind that I can't really make out the red squiggly lines in my code - but I find the feature really useful when I do notice them.

I've tried switching to a much lighter background but it doesn't feel right - I've been using the classic background in Borland/Inprise/Borland/Codegear/Embarcadero products since about '91. :-)

Does anyone know of any slight-of-hand that would get the colour of that red line changed (white or yellow would be great)?

EDIT: Okay, further to this then - although I can't move most of my existing stuff to D2009 just yet, is this an option I CAN set in D2009?

EDIT : Seems like it can't be done, in 2007 or 2009. Let's hope it gets picked up for the next version. Bob S's link to the qc document for it can be used to help persuade Embarcadero - I opened that case last year when I first struggled to find a solution for this. In the interests of marking something as an answer, I'll tick Bob's reply. 

In the meantime, I think I'm going to have to change my background colour to something that I can see the red against. Oh well. :-)

Title: Is it possible to use Visual Studio as an IDE for Google Web Toolkit?
Description: 
    
    
                    
As a long time user of Visual Studio, I feel comfortable using this as my primary IDE for editing code (I primarily code in C#/ASP.NET). Lately I've been looking more in depth into the Google Web Toolkit (or GWT) as a potential tool for building rapid web client tools for the web. I would therefore like to know whether it is possible to edit Java syntax, and otherwise set Visual Studio up to built web applications for GWT?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The option i m using is using Eclipse with an IntelliJ Idea key mapping ( i m  a resharper fan and I miss it)
Another option is take the plunge and get IntelliJ Idea, its a fantastic IDE and it was really easy to get used to it, it has some nice pluggins for GWT development too

Cheers
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
What is Visual Studio's support for Java like, I assuming that its GWT support is not as good. ;)

I think you are better off using an IDE which actually supports GWT. 
You could have a look at http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/gwt.html The demo is rather old (from 2006) but if you haven't seen IntelliJ it might be interesting.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Visual Studio used to be the best Java IDE in the 90's.
Since then much better alternatives came out.

The 3 most commonly used right now are:
Eclipse
NetBeans
IntelliJ.

Microsoft stopped supporting Java development a long time ago. At that time Java was still at 1.3. With Java 1.5 the language was extended with generics and other constructs that Visual Studio will certainly not support.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
If you manage to use Visual Studio for Java (or maybe J# could work?), integrate Maven in it and then use the maven gwt plugin to translate the java to ajax, it shoooould be possible.
But this is just an idea, would probably take a lot of efford, if it works at all.
    
    
Title: How to return the Visual Studio currently open soution directory
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a Visual Studio solution that comprises of several projects and are separated into different directories.

In my C# or VB.NET code, I want to determine the base directory (or the directory that the solution is in).  

A dirty solution would be to call the directory parent.parent.parent until I find a file *.sln, but I also have several solutions in other directories that I don't want to be returned.

I am just wondering if there is a cleaner method, maybe part of System.Diagnostics.Debugger or similar?

I look forward to your reply, thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As the sln file does not need to be deployed on the target machine - why are you trying to find it at all?
If you still want to use the sln- try at EnvDTE Namespace


  EnvDTE.DTE dte = (EnvDTE.DTE)   System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetActiveObject("VisualStudio.DTE");
           string folder = System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName(dte.ActiveDocument.FullName);

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Even though you have solutions in other directories, presumably those aren't directories within your original solution, are they? What situation do you envisage where the "recurse up until you find a .sln file" would fail (other than running from the wrong directory)?

One alternative would be to pass the solution directory as a command line argument.

What do you need this for, out of interest?
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Thank you for your answers.  All were very helpful.  I worked with the answer from Dror and with a little modification to the following line solved this problem, thanks.

string folder = System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName(dte.Solution.FullName);


The reason I want to do this is whilst running the code in the IDE I determine the current Subversion revision of the project so that I can embed this into the running software version.

This is done automatically.  See the article I wrote at codeproject:
link text

If you look at the code you will see I perform the following:
dirinfoSourceWorkingDir = dirInfo.Parent().Parent().Parent();

I need to determine the directory of the solution currently open in Visual Studio but want a cleaner way (and if I change the directory structure this would break the code). 

Hope this makes sense!
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Is the code being run from within the solution, i.e. within the IDE debugger? If so you can pass the solution directory as $(SolutionDir) from the IDE to the command line.
    
    
Title: How do I go to the end of a line in VS code without using the mouse or some key combinations?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using VS Code to write some HTML. I noticed that the IDE will auto-insert some code for me. For example, if I want a &lt;p&gt; tag, VS Code will create &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; for me and the cursor will land in the middle (between the opening and closing paragraph tags). However, when I am done typing the content inside the &lt;p&gt; tags, typically, I use my mouse or the directional right-arrow to move to the end. Is there a way to not move my fingers from the typing positions (e.g. fdsa and jkl;) to go to the end of the line or tag, or would I always have to use the mouse or directional pad?
I find IDEs like what JetBrains provide do not have this limitation for certain languages. For example, in Python, if I want to print something using PyCharm, I can type (the closing single quote and right parenthesis are auto-added)
print('')

My cursor will land inside the single quotes. To simply get outside the closing parenthesis, I simply type in ' followed by ) and the IDE is smart enough to know to not place the single quote and closing parenthesis there (it's like using the right arrow twice to get outside the print statement).
WebStorm, like VS Code, has the &quot;problem&quot; when dealing with HTML. If I am inside an opening and closing &lt;p&gt; tag, and right next to the closing one &lt;/p&gt;, simply typing &lt;, /, p, &gt; will not land me outside (as with Python and PyCharm). On Windows, I can press the End key or on Mac I can press fn+right to get to the end; but that requires breaking the flow and continuity of my hands in the typing positions (eyes have to be redirected too).
Any tips on how to be a more productive coder using VS Code or other modern IDEs with HTML? Are there plugins that we may use to address this problem?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I believe the default is ctrl + e. I don't recall changing it in my keybindings, but maybe I did. Regardless you can set it to what ever you want. It's named cursorLineEnd

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I often just use &lt;CTRL&gt; + → (right arrow) a few times to quickly navigate past words and code blocks. It won't immediately get you to the end but if there isn't a ton of code after your current cursor location, a few quick uses of this keystroke can be faster than lifting your hands and checking with eyes to find the  key.
Depending on what your keyboard layout is, this could be faster. Personally, if it's a big issue, I would second other posters here and add a custom keybind / hotkey to a lesser-used key nearby.
//Begin CAVEAT
I'm not mentioning just using the &lt;END&gt; key here as a solution purposefully, since you indicated that using that using keys too far from home row broke your flow. Depending on my keyboard layout, that is often the fastest option by far, however my current keyboard makes that a non-starter.
Part of the issue here is that people's experience is so different based on what keyboard they're using, as well as hand size and dexterity. YMMV with any solutions we mention that isn't a custom keybind.
//END CAVEAT

Cmd + Right

This will go to the end of you current line.
Tips:

Hold down shift to start a selection
Use Alt or Ctrl instead of Cmd to change the distance the cursor travels

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I'm not sure which OS you specifically use being that you mentioned but an OS agnostic approach is to create your own keybind / key chord (sequence).
A key chord is essentially a way to use another 'layer' of key shortcuts, if you use your imagination for lingo. To illustrate: consider CTRL + S  is a keyboard shortcut. Now consider CRTL + K chord CTRL + S, which is a completely different shortcut even though you use the same sequence.
Consider an edit/insert mode
I don't use vim, nor have I ever tried, but I really find value in the idea of having different 'modes', one visual one for insert and edit. Personally, I have elected CTRL + E to be my chord sequence for 'edit mode'. Now, every single key and sequence of keys becomes a brand new possability. Why CTRL + E? Well 'e' for edit, naturally, but also because it is default duplicate; for whatever reason vscode identifies this shortcut to be the same as CTRL + P by default.
I then use $ to go to the end of the line and ^ to the beginning, arbitrarily because of regex, but the point is you can create your own according to your own preference, which appears to be that of the home row. So if you elect to go this approach you can use j if you want. If you were to argue this is too much user input for a single action, consider the position of using a PC at home and a mac at work, as I do, you would already be comfortable with your settings and not need to 're-learn' shortcuts.
This answer uses an approach that affords you the creative freedom to define what a 'productive coder' looks like for you, provides a different approach to going to the end of line while maintaining your home row position, and hopefully demonstrates to any new vscoders that you are not bound to just using the native CTRL + K sequence as the chord identifier.
Regardless, re:

without using ... some key combinations?

That's unavoidable, I think, unless you choose to remap normal typing keys for this purpose

Title: Is there a possibility to glow the led in 5*5 matrix in a square shape with the common anode configuration
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a led-matrix that is common anode in row-wise and common cathode in column-wise. I need to glow the matrix in the shape of a square(first row &amp;&amp; last row &amp;&amp; first column &amp;&amp; last column) , but I was not able to do it. I was able to glow the first and last row separately and first and second column separately)

int Led_Row_Pins[] = { 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 } ;             //   Anode pins are shorted in row_wise_manner

Answer 1: 

    
    
In your specific case you could switch on the first and last row for e.g. 1msec then switch on the first and last column for 1msec and repeat this. I further suggest to switch off all LEDs before switching on a new pattern.

void loop() { 
      static int show_rows = 0;

      switch_all_off();
      if(show_rows) {
          first_last_row();
      } else {
          first_last_column();
      }
      show_rows = !show_rows;
      delay(10);
}

void switch_all_off()
{
    int off = 0;
    for( j = 0 ; j &lt; Loop_Count ; j++ )
    {
          digitalWrite(Led_Row_Pins[i],off);
          digitalWrite(Led_Column_Pins[j],!off);
    }
}



With this first step the LEDs that are contained both in the rows and in the columns will be brighter. To fix this you can exclude the corner LEDs either from the rows or from the columns, e.g.

void first_last_column()
{

    for( j = 0 ; j &lt; Loop_Count ; j++ )// Led First And Last Column
    {
        for( i = 0 ; i &lt; Loop_Count ; i++)
        {
            if((i != 0) &amp;&amp; (i != 4) &amp;&amp; ( j == 0 || j == 4 ))
            {
                digitalWrite(Led_Row_Pins[i],state);//    Led_On_State
                digitalWrite(Led_Column_Pins[j],!state);
            }
        }
    }
}


For a more general solution you have to loop over the rows, activate one row after the other and switch the column pins as necessary for the current row.

#define MAXLEDS 5
int states[MAXLEDS][MAXLEDS] = {
    { 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 },
    { 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 },
    { 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 },
    { 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 },
    { 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 }
};

void switch_leds(int row) {
    int i;

    /* switch off all rows */
    for(i = 0; i &lt; MAXLEDS, i++) {
        digitalWrite(Led_Row_Pins[i], 0);
    }

    /* switch columns according to current row */
    for(i = 0; i &lt; MAXLEDS; i++) {
        digitalWrite(Led_Column_Pins[i], !states[row][i]);
    }

    /* switch on current row */
    digitalWrite(Led_Row_Pins[row], 1);

}

void loop() { 
    static int row = 0;
    /* switch on LEDs in a single row */
    switch_leds(row);
    /* next row */
    row++; row %= MAXLEDS;
    /* The processing delay between calls to loop() is added to this delay. */
    delay(5);
}

Title: Best IDE / Plugin for develop Solidity
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am developing some complex solidity smartcontracts (using some external libraries such as Oraclize). 
The think is that the IDE that I am using for the moment Remix and Oraclize IDE dosen't fit with the requirments that I want, I need:


To compile, deploy and test a smartcontract that can use Oraclize library
Have the files in local and be allowed to use a private github repository
Compile the contracts only when clicking Ctrl + S
Have a desktop environment (Like IntellIJ or Atom)


I have tried some plugins like etheratom (With lots of smartcontracts the program brokes), Intellij solidity plugin (In this one I don't know how to compile and deploy the contracts).

EDIT: 

And I missed a very important feature that I want and that dosen't have any IDE that I have tryed.


Give the exact position of errors like invalid opcode


I have serched a lot and I didn't find anything.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
IMHO, as a previous user of Atom and IntelliJ, I will recommend VSCode.

I find these extentions really great for developing smart contracts with solidity on VSCode:


Material Icon Theme, for better distinguish folders and files;
solidity or solidity-solhint, Ethereum Solidity Language for Visual Studio Code;
Trailing spaces, highlight trailing spaces and delete them;
Rainbow Brackets, for cool brackets; :)
Indent rainbow, for better and easier indentation
GitHistory and GitLens.


You should have a better experience with that and then try to test the code in the plugin.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Since Solidity is relatively young a lot of actions has to be done manually for setting up compiling and deployment process.

In fact there are tools to help you the processes 


Truffle is a development environment and testing framework and asset aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier. 
Ganache-CLI or Ganache-GUI - Ethereum RPC client for testing and development.
Intellij-Solidity   is a plugin for Itnellij-based IDEs offers syntax highlighting, code formatting and autocomplete for Solidity files.

Description: 
    
    
                    
On building my code i cannot see the debug points in the pages.Only the page which is open while building shows the debug points.Also, The breakpoint is not getting hit and CPU window is opening by default where debug is set. I searched for the same and found this following statement on Embarcadero page (http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Tokyo/en/CPU_Windows_Index):


  The CPU window also opens automatically whenever program execution stops at a location for which source code is unavailable. For example, the debugger cannot open the source file if you link a DLL (Windows) built with debug information but do not include its source file in your project, or if you place the source file in a directory not specified in your project.


I also tried following things:


When I create a new project, put a breakpoint, it hits (no CPU
window opens up in this case).
When I modify the original code (like    just put ShowMessage('Hello World');) where debug point is not
hitting, message dialog appears but debug is not hitting.

use the "debug" buildconfiguration of your project, which should be configured like this


searchpath matches your actual sources
"local symbols" is true
"with debug dcus" is true
"debug-information" is debug-information
"optimization" is false
one time i also had to check "remote debugging symbols"

try to close the ide and reopen it with just one project
if you use devextension, go to devextensions options

Title: Remove unneeded tabs from VS Code in Sidebar
Description: 
    
    
                    
On the bottom of the sidebar, you'll see 3 "tabs"; Docker, Commits, &amp; Compare Commits. I can disable them per workspace but next time I open code, it's still there. I've searched everywhere to figure this one out. How do I disable them permanently? All of my search queries returned how to interact with Git and VS Code but not how to disable this feature. I also searched through the Settings in VS Code but didn't find anything related to what I am after.

Title: PhpStorm Template Variables documentation
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have looked everywhere for documentation that explains the various template variables used in file watcher but I can't find anything.  I know what some of them mean, but is there an exhaustive list of variables that are defined.

Examples:

$FilePathRelativeToProjectRoot$
$FileNameWithoutExtension$
$FileDirPathFromParent(js)$


Live Template Variables describe a couple but it doesn't seem to be an exhaustive list.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The only available documentation is the short macro description in the Macros dialog (shown on pressing Insert macro... button). BTW, this dialog has macro preview for currently opened file.

$FilePathRelativeToProjectRoot$ is a file path from project root/module content root folder. For example, if the file is &lt;Project root&gt;/app/stylesheets/style.less, $FilePathRelativeToProjectRoot$ will return app/stylesheets/style.less

$FileNameWithoutExtension$ is, well, a file name without extension:) A result of $FileName$.substring(0, file.lastIndexOf('.')). For style.less it will be style

$FileDirPathFromParent(js)$ - path to file directory relative to the js directory
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Sorry folks, I knew I say it yesterday.  You can see all the variables by selecting insert macro next to the File Watchers Arguments and Output paths fields.

Actually the template variables is just a variable in any programming language, you can define whatever you want, evening a, b, ab ...... any legal

And the variable's scope is only in the template text, and you can define the variable like the default value in the "Edit Variables".

Unfortunately some of them are indeed not documented, but they can be found on our tracker e.g. https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-28253

Title: Setting up the CLION IDE for c++ on mac computer
Description: 
    
    
                    
I want to use the CLION IDE and I'am wondering if I need to Download a compiler for my mac computer?

I have read this page: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.3/quick-start-guide.html

But to me its not very clear if I need to download one or not. 
Im asking this question since Im not getting Clion working with the libraries I want and I'm trying to figure out what the problem is. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes, you do need to install a compiler for CLion to be able to run C++ or C programs on it. Macbooks, or iMacs, do not come pre-installed with a compiler.

On a Mac, you can get a compiler by installing XCode. When you install XCode, you also automatically get the necessary Command Line Tools and the latest version of the Clang compiler by default, which you can use with Clion to run your code. While the Clang compiler provided by Apple is slightly "modified", it will still work with any IDE besides XCode.

So what you need to do to get XCode is:


  
  Open a Terminal window on your Mac.
  Type xcode-select --install in the terminal and hit "ENTER"
  A dialog will appear telling you that it requires the Command Line Developer Tools, and will ask if you would like to install them. Click on the "Install" button.
  


To test the success of the installation of Clang, enter the clang --version command into your terminal. If it works, and the version of Clang shows up, then you have successfully installed it on your Mac.

This will get you all the necessary tools on your Mac for you to compile code with your CLion IDE.
    
    
Title: Android Studio: Does not show all errors immediately
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm coming from Eclipse and I am used to immediate error reporting over the whole project.

Lets say I have this function:

public void test() {
   //Do something
}


and I change it to 

public void test(String someString) {
   //Do something
}


Then eclipse would immediately highlight all classes in the project explorer, that call test() without also passing a string.

Android studio does not. It only shows it, when I happen to open such a file. Ofcource, when I compile, I will also get an error, but also only for the first file he tried to compile and failed and not for all.

I am currently in a big refactoring and this is really tedious. Compile - wait - fix one file - start over...

Am I missing someting? Not even Analyze/Inspect code... does the trick.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Too late for you by now, but for future reference to yourself:


Instead of changing  the signature of the method by adding an argument to it "manually", right click on the method, go to Refactor, go to Change Signature, in the Parameters tab click on the plus icon and add the parameter there. Now right click on the method again and select Find Usages. That will show you where you're calling the new refactored method and you can fix your code quickly.


However, to answer your question, you can see where all your errors are. Just go to Build and rebuild your project via Rebuild Project and then go the left hand side of Android Studio and change the project view to Problems

Arguments
min(iterable[, key=func])


I find this very helpful but Spyder closes this list after 1.5sec. I would like to have this still open after 1.5sec. In fact it would be perfect if this list remained open while I type the arguments since it helps me to see what I need to specify for a correct function call. As far as I can remember, other IDEs such as Eclipse or QtCreator support this. Is this also possible with Spyder?

In the preferences section under Editor I found:

Highlight occurences after 1500ms

Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there any way to have XCode display C++ variable types in Quick Help? Currently, when a variable is selected, it only shows "Declared int foo.cc". 

In AppCode this works and is specially useful for "auto" variables, since it displays the deducted variable type.

It works correctly for methods.

Using XCode 7.2 at the moment.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't think that it is possible in XCode 7.2 (or lower)

So far the closest I could find is to force XCode to show you an error. E.g. let's say you have this code:

template&lt;typename K, typename V&gt;
std::map&lt;K, V&gt; createMap()
{
    return std::map&lt;K, V&gt;();
}

void process()
{
    auto myMap = createMap&lt;std::string, int&gt;();
    // ...
}


and you need to find out what is type of myMap variable. 

Create helper class and macro:

template &lt;typename T&gt; class DeductTypeCatcher {
public:
    DeductTypeCatcher() { T t = (void***)0; }
};

#define SHOW_DEDUCT_TYPE(t)     DeductTypeCatcher&lt;decltype(t)&gt; __catcher__;


Then add into your original code:

void process()
{
    auto myMap = createMap&lt;std::string, int&gt;();
    SHOW_DEDUCT_TYPE(myMap)
}


and XCode will immediately show you an error:

No viable conversion from 'void ***' to 'std::__1::map&lt;std::__1::basic_string&lt;char&gt;, int, std::__1::less&lt;std::__1::basic_string&lt;char&gt; &gt;, std::__1::allocator&lt;std::__1::pair&lt;const std::__1::basic_string&lt;char&gt;, int&gt; &gt; &gt;'


or let's say you have this code:

void process()
{
    auto myMap = createMap&lt;std::string, int&gt;();
    for (auto it : myMap) { /*...*/ }
}


and want to find out the type of "it":

void process()
{
    auto myMap = createMap&lt;std::string, int&gt;();
    SHOW_DEDUCT_TYPE(*myMap.begin())
    for (auto it : myMap) { /*...*/ }
}


will show you an error:

Non-const lvalue reference to type 'std::__1::pair&lt;const std::__1::basic_string&lt;char&gt;, int&gt;' cannot bind to a temporary of type 'void ***'


I know it is not a perfect solution, but at least better than nothing.

EDITED: 

Another approach could be to rely on IDE itself. 

E.g. in this example:

void process()
{
    auto myMap = createMap&lt;std::string, int&gt;();
    SHOW_DEDUCT_TYPE(*myMap.begin())
    for (auto it : myMap) {
    }
}


start typing "it" (without quotes) inside for loop. Autocomplete dialog will popup and you should see the type of "it" variable on the left side of autocomplete box. If type is too long then hover mouse over it and wait for a few seconds - the full type will be displayed (sometimes full type does not show up, then you have to press Ctrl+Space few times).

Another approach is using the screen vim plugin. I like that a little better because it avoids the config step. So here is what you do:

create some convenience commands in your .vimrc (see what I added below)
Open .py file, hit &lt;LocalLeader&gt;p and you are good to go. Note that you don't have to open TMUX before you open the .py file.


This is what I added (based on https://github.com/akhilsbehl/configs/blob/master/vimrc):

" use tmux for splitting screen
let g:ScreenImpl = "Tmux"

" default width of tmux shell pane
let g:ScreenShellWidth = 82

Title: Docker and Java IDE integration
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'll start by saying that I'm not a Java developer and also I'm not a Docker expert.

In order to minimize the gap between frontend and backend (in this specific case, Java) developers I started to put some docker images in place with java and maven and after the build I start a docker container with a volume pointing to the java project (and frontend developers don't have to worry about dependencies or how to run backend services).

Already here I have a question.
I've seen other people building an image with the actual code inside instead of attaching it later, so what's the best case (if there's one)?
I've done this way since I can reuse that image for "every" project and avoid building different images.

For starting/stopping/restarting docker containers I created a script that does all of that, so I can make some changes to the code, bring it down and up again.

It kinda works, and what I mean is, I'm well aware this is not a normal workflow of a Java developer to do that kind of stuff from a console.
So now, to the most important question, how do you integrate docker with a Java IDE?
I know that you can create custom build/run commands but I also read that things like logs are not displayed on the IDE's.

Can someone explain me how are you using Docker + Java IDE's?

Note: Maven is also used for compiling java code, like mvn clean install (if this helps)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I do not use Docker with a Java IDE. I use the IDE (Eclipse) to write and test the code, with Maven to manage the build. Then I have a Dockerfile like this:

FROM java:8

RUN apt-get update || apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y maven

# Maven installs Java 7, which set itself as the default...
RUN update-alternatives --remove java /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java

CMD java -jar target/main.jar

# Pull down dependencies here to allow Docker to cache more
ADD pom.xml /opt/app/pom.xml
WORKDIR /opt/app
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -X

# I use the maven-shade-plugin to build a single jar
ADD src /opt/app/src
RUN mvn package


If you build all your images on one machine, then Docker will cache intelligently and you don't need to do anything more. If you want to run across more machines, or you just want to make it explicit, you could do something like this:

base/Dockerfile:

FROM java:8

RUN apt-get update || apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y maven
RUN update-alternatives --remove java /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java

CMD java -jar target/main.jar



  $ docker build -t yourorg/java-base:8 ./base/


myapp/Dockerfile:

FROM yourorg/java-base:8

ADD pom.xml /opt/app/pom.xml
WORKDIR /opt/app
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -X

ADD src /opt/app/src
RUN mvn package


You don't get as big an effect from Docker with Java, because JARs are already pretty portable and well-contained. I suppose it makes it easy to run different Java versions side-by-side. I use it because it allows me to run applications in different languages without needing to know what's inside the container. I have some in Java, some in Python, some in JavaScript, some in Erlang, but they all get started as docker run -d &lt;flags&gt; myorg/myimage:someversion.

Title: IDE for eBooks to use version control
Description: 
    
    
                    
I want to write eBooks using Git as version control software. Since neither Git supports .epub files (at least not diff-able) nor Sigil or Calibre supports any kind of using an eBook as "project" (folder with containing files), I wanted to ask you how I could achieve this, if it's possible at all.
Since an .epub file is nothing more than a collection of folders and files, I don't see any problems with this, but I just can't find anything on Google...

Edit: Since I rather work with HTML and CSS files, I created my own solution for this problem: With EpubCreator you are now able to place all your .epub files into the src/ folder. As soon as you want to view your work up to now, you just can run the index.php script, which will in first instance assemble an .epub file from source and save it into the bin/ folder. After that, it will call the just created .epub file and display it in your browser. It should then look like this:

There are now plugins or so needed, the displaying is achieved with epub.js, another project on GitHub (if you are interested, it is linked in the LICENSE.md in my project).
I hope this helps anybody. Also, as I often make ebooks, I will keep on with the work. This is now about 6 hours of work, I hope I will be able to improve it a lot. Thanks for your tips and inspiration.

There are probably some tricks and gotchas that I have to figure out, for example, is it possible to show files that have been edited within a branch, but to exclude merges of other branches?

Root Directory Structure (based on branches')

[branch]

[branch2]

[branch3]

`--[all] (symlinks to all files in one bucket)

`--[PATH\SYMLINK] (directory path + symlink)

`--[PATH\SYMLINK]

Notes:

Git: How do I list only local branches?

git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/

#!/bin/bash

You should use git-new-workdir, it is available with most git distributions - see link.

The git-new-workdir script will create a fully functional symlinked repo, where you can choose to work on a single branch. Repeat N times for N branches.

It is really advisable to use the script manually at first, but if you want to get going for an existing repo, you can automate along the lines of:

SYM_TREE_DIR=/tmp/my_git_branches
REPO=/path/to/my/repo/to/clone

mkdir -p $SYM_TREE_DIR

cd $REPO
git for-each-ref --format="%(refname)" refs/heads | \
while read entry
do
        # extract just the leaf branch name for simplicity
        # (remove the first 11 characters that correspond to "refs/heads/")
        BRANCH=${entry:11}

        # attempt to clone the repo into the SYM_TREE_DIR
        if ../git-new-workdir . $SYM_TREE_DIR/$BRANCH $BRANCH  &amp;&gt; /dev/null
        then
          echo Successfully created linked repo $BRANCH at $SYM_TREE_DIR/$BRANCH
        else
          echo Failed to create linked repo $BRANCH at $SYM_TREE_DIR/$BRANCH
        fi
done

    
    
Title: How to save files OUTSIDE the Eclipse IDE workspace?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have opened a file in the text editor inside Eclipse IDE.
When I click File=kbd/kbdstrong/strong/ppstrong/strong/ppcode/codecode/code/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
The base Eclipse text editor will open the OS File Save dialog (actually org.eclipse.swt.widgets.FileSaveDialog) if the file being edited is not in the workspace. If the file is in the workspace the workspace Save As dialog used (org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.SaveAsDialog).

I can't see any way to get it to show the OS file save dialog for a workspace file.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Select the file you want to save in the package explorer, right click and select Export...

Select File System and click Next, then you can select any file system location


    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Your best bet is probably to save the file in your workspace (using Save as so you don't overwrite the original file) and then copy that file somewhere else. You can simply move the file (rather than copying), but this will close the editor.

I've used the "reformat code" option but it refuses to format the code to my custom settings. I have changed the "code style" settings in a new template and I'm using it. There is not option to change code style on a global level.

It continutes to format my code like this:

if (x) {
    y();
}


It should look like this:

if (x) 
{
    y();
}


Any thoughts? Just to confirm I have gone into settings and changed the code style in my custom template for the project. I see no global code style option for the IDE settings.

I am running Mac OSX 10.8.4 with Python 2.7 and I just downloaded PyCharm Version: 3.0 Build: 131.190. 

When I opened it and chose "Create New Project", in the 'Interpreter' pull-down menu there was no options to chose an interpreter (It just says ''). 

Just in case it was an issue with Python (although I use IDLE regularly), I downloaded Python 3.3 just to see if the new version would be identified by PyCharm, but again with no luck - the 'Interpreter' pull down menu had no options to select (It just says ''). 

Im sure I am just overlooking something during installation, but why can't PyCharm identify the Interpreter? 

Thanks!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Its not supposed to. It did not for me. When I fist installed it, and created a new project, I just directed PyCharm to my Python installation.

You need to click one "New Project", then click on the "..." button next to the interpreter drop-down box, and then, you need to click on the + sign, choose to add "local", and then point to python.exe for whatever interpreter is installed.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
No worries, you can do this:


Open Preferences of pyCharm.
Click on Project:
Select the virtual env interpreter in drop down and apply &amp; ok.
Go To edit configuration and select your interpreter there.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using C++ in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 professional on Windows 7 64 bit.

It seems the View Call Hierarchy function does not work on this machine, which I used frequently on other machines... I have no idea why it does not work now...

When I right-click a method, and click "View Call Hierarchy", the hierarchy does not show in the corresponding tab; actually nothing happens there...

Has anyone encountered this before? How can I find this function back? Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can try to delete the Intellisense files, sometimes it's the problem when things like "go to definition" or "view call hierarchy" stop functionning correctly. You can delete the .sdf files, and the IPCH folder, then start your project again.

Title: Is it possible to connect a property to an embedded component
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'd like to write a complex component that embeds other components. But I am not sure if I'll be able to connect to those components via object inspector.

To clarify, imagine a component that holds a list of TDataSources. These DataSource components are owned by this component and not visible on the form.

Now I'd like to connect a TDataset to one of these Datasources, is that possible, will these Datasources show up in the property editor combo of Dataset ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It is possible, but you have to type (or copy) the name; you cannot select it in the OI.

Using the component written below, you can type e.g. MyComp1.InternalDataSource into the DataSource property of a DBGrid:

uses
  Classes, DB;

type
  TMyComp = Class(TComponent)
  private
    FDataSource: TDataSource;
  public
    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent);override;
  published
    property DataSource: TDataSource read FDataSource;
  end;

procedure Register;

implementation

procedure Register;
begin
  RegisterComponents('TEST', [TMyComp]);
end;

{ TMyComp }

constructor TMyComp.Create(AOwner: TComponent);
begin
  inherited Create(AOwner);
  FDataSource := TDataSource.Create(Self);

Title: Can VS change variable values in my js on publish
Description: 
    
    
                    
I run VS2010 Web Developer and I set a javascript variable to one value for testing. When I publish my work, I that variable should be another value to affect the final behavior. So, in the rumpa.js file i have the following.

$(document).ready(function () {
  var iable = "test value";
  ...}


However, just before I execute publish, I manually edit the line so it looks as follows.

$(document).ready(function () {
  var iable = "publish value";
  ...}


It works great, except I often forget to change the iable to "publish value" until an unhappy customer calls.  That is not optimal development technique.

Can I somehow make VS change my source code so I won't have to?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You could use config transformation files. This way you can have different settings for each publish profile. More info can be found here: http://blog.hmobius.com/post/2010/02/17/ASPNET-40-Part-4-Config-Transformation-Files.aspx
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The link referenced in Rob Angelier's answer isn't working for me. Since I was looking for the same issue today, I found you can use #DEBUG:

#if DEBUG
    var iable = "test value";
#else
    var iable = "publish value";
#endif


However I sometimes need to publish a debug build to the server which this method does not allow for. So you can check for the server name:

var iable;
if (window.location.hostname=="localhost")
{
    var iable = "test value";
} else
{
    var iable = "publish value";
}


Or in Angular I use a service as:

(function () {
    "use strict";

    angular
        .module("common.services", ["ngResource"])
        .constant("appSettings",
        {
            commonsetting: false,
        });

    if (window.location.hostname=="localhost")
    {
        // local dev settings
        angular
            .module("common.services", ["ngResource"])
            .constant("appSettings",
            {
                iable = "test value";
            });
    } else
    {
        // remote settings
        angular
            .module("common.services", ["ngResource"])
            .constant("appSettings",
            {
                var iable = "publish value";
            });
    }
}());

Title: How to redirect output from the NASM command line assembler in C#
Description: 
    
    
                    
Brief Summary

I am creating a lightweight IDE for NASM development in C# (I know kind of an irony). Kinda of like Notepad++ but simpler but with features that make it more than source editor. Since Notepad++ is really just a fancy source editor. I have already implemented features like Project creation (using a project format similar to how Visual Studio organizes projects). Project extension .nasmproj. I am also in the works of hosting it in an open-source place (Codeplex). Although the program is far from finish, and definitely cannot be used in a production environment without proper protection and equipment. In addition, I am working alone with it at this moment, more like a spare time project since I just finished my last Summer final taking Calculus I.

Problem

Right now I am facing a problem, I can build the project but no output from NASM is being fed into the IDE. I have succesfully built a project, and I was able to produce object files. I even tried producing a syntax error to see if I finally see something come up but none and I check the bin folder of the test project I created and I see no object file creating. So definitely NASM is doing its magic. Is it because NASM doesn't want me to see its output. Is there a solution? Any advice would be great. Here is the code which I think is giving Trouble.

Things to Note


I have already checked if events have been invoked. An yes they have but they return empty strings
I have also checked error data and same effect. 


Code

    public static bool Build(string arguments,  out Process nasmP)
    {

            nasm.CreateNoWindow = true;
            nasm.RedirectStandardError = true;
            nasm.RedirectStandardInput = true;
            nasm.RedirectStandardOutput = true;

            nasm.UseShellExecute = false;                
            nasmP = new Process();
            nasmP.EnableRaisingEvents = true;
            nasmP.StartInfo = nasm;
            bool predicate = nasmP.Start();

            return true;

Edits


I have tried doing synchronously instead of asynchronously but still the same result (and empty string "" is returned) actually by debugging the stream is already at the end. So looks like nothing has been written into the stream.  


This is what I tried:

            string readToEnd = nasmP.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
            nasmP.WaitForExit();
            Console.WriteLine(readToEnd);


And another interesting thing I have tried was I copied the arguments from the debugger and pasted it in the command line shell and I can see NASM compiling and giving the error that I wanted to see all along. So definitely not a NASM problem. Could it be a problem with my code or the .Net framework. 

Here is a nice snapshot of the shell window (although not technically proof; this is what the output should look like in my IDE):



Alan made a very good point, check the sub processes or threads. Is sub process and thread synonymous? But here is the problem. Almost all the properties except a select few and output/error streams are throwing an invalid operation.

I use Eclipse with PyDev to develop Python code, and I wouldn't want to miss all its useful IDE features. One thing is a little annoying: The latency between when I type and when the source code changes is a little to high. (Not as snappy as, for example, Sublime Text 2.)

Is this due to overhead of some editor features which can be disabled? Can I do something to tune my editor settings for speed and responsiveness?

Description: 
    
    
                    
I feel like either the "Next" button or the "Finish" button should be enabled at this point.

Any ideas?


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Scroll all columns on the left side to the bottom.

Updating to the latest version of Aptana solved this problem.

I updated by selecting the help menu in Aptana, then selecting the "Check for updates" sub-menu:

Title: Helping IDE resolve file paths in included files
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a standard front controller / bootstrap configuration, with the front controller at root/index.php and the bootstrap at root/app/bootstrap.php.

The front controller loads the boostrap file with require_once 'app/bootstrap.php';.

The bootstrap then loads necessary files using paths relative to the front controller, such as require_once 'model/model.php';.

My IDE (PhpStorm 3.0.2) flags the file paths in the bootstrap with a warning that says "Can't resolve target of expression..."

Is there a comment and/or code that can I add to the bootstrap file to help my IDE recognize and resolve the directory/inclusion scheme?

The following ought to work. Annoyingly, it doesn't work if you use $config-a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issue/WI-7738" rel="nofollow"/a/pprecode/code/pre/div
Title: IDE Gradient Toolbars
Description: 
    
    
                    
Sorry for posting a non technical question :(

Look at the attached image:



How can I give the Delphi XE IDE the gradient style toolbars?

For VCL TToolbar you can set DrawingStyle := dsGradient for the same effect, but how may I change this for the IDE, I cannot see a option?

PS, My IDE looks blue because of a Windows theme I am using.

Update with Result:



Thanks :)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There is an expert to disable gradients in BDS 2006. As it comes with source you can probably adapt it to XE and make it enable gradients.
    
    
Title: Is there a plugin for Eclipse that immediately evaluates a highlighted expression?
Description: 
    
    
                    
A colleague of mine uses Netbeans, and I noticed a tremendously useful feature it has in debug mode: it immediately shows what a highlighted expression evaluates to in a tooltip. I'm not sure whether this is a standard feature in Netbeans, but I would definitely find it useful in Eclipse as well.

Does anyone know a plugin or a similar way of using this in Eclipse?

EDIT:
Eclipse provides tooltips for single variable evaluation and expressions evaluation in the expressions view. This is not what I need. In Netbeans, you can highlight an expression (possibly containing more than one variable) and it gets evaluated in a tooltip.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In Eclipse debug mode you can add needed expression to Expression view and check its value or you can hover mouse over variables and check theirs values
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
In Eclipse, when you're running your program in the debugger, you should be able to add a Watcher for a variable, or just simply evaluate an expression (I believe) in the Watcher tab.  Sorry, I don't actually use Eclipse full-time, this is just from memory as I have used it in the past...
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Three years later (don't know if it was before) you can Inspect the selected expression.
Select it, right click and choose Inspect, or press Ctrl+Shift+I (personally I changed that shortcut to one more reachable F12).
    
    
Title: Eclipse CDT - Could not open Editor: Editor could not be initialized?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm running Eclipse Helios (3.6) with the latest CDT (plus HgEclipse, ANTLR IDE, PDT, and probably a few other things). It was running great, until recently in which when I tried to open any file that uses the C/C++ editor in CDT gives an error:

Could not open the editor: Editor could not be initialized.


The details option gives this:

I am using Eclipse x86 on Ubuntu 10.10 (also x86).

If you think it might be the files themselves, you can access them at http://hg.redxdev.com/dyst (username: anon password: anon).

Thanks a lot!

Well, it seems that the project configuration was messed up. I deleted the project files and re-made it, and now it is fine (deleted .cproject, removed references to cdt in .project, removed cdt files inside /.settings)

I think the reason is compatibility problems between latest CDT and old Eclipse Helios, try to use Eclipse Indigo instead.
Here is the latest stable build http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.7M6-201103101119/index.php

Same error message occurred when Eclipse was trying to show files in the editor that belonged to a closed project. I had forced Eclipse to terminate previously and on start up it tried to show files of a project that I had closed.

Corrupt download, probably. Or a 32/64 bit issue (this is suggestive that at least some of what it's trying is 64 bit: "org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_64")?

Which version did you download? What mirror and what file from that mirror did you use?
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You downloaded the 64 bit version, and you try to run on 32 bit windows.
    
    
Title: How to get out of interactive mode in Python
Description: 
    
    
                    
This obviously an extremely novice question, but I've installed Python 2.7 and started reading the manual. However I looked and looked, and couldn't understand how to start programming a file rather than writing in interactive mode. One book that was online suggested quit(), which surprise -- quit the program.

Should coding be done in a different program? I'm using IDLE (Python GUI). Can coding not be done within that program?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes, coding should be done in a different program.  The interactive shell is very useful but it's not an editor.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You write Python code line by line (as you would on Python interactive mode) in a text editor such as vim, emacs etc...
Then you run these line by line code using the Python interpreter by giving it the name of your script.

$ python myscript.py

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I like to use a different directory for each project.  Suppose I decide to use W:/mytest as my directory.  First I create the directory.

Then I start Idle.  I type the following:

import os
os.chdir("W:/mytest")


This makes W:/mytest the current directory for Idle.

import sys
sys.path.append(".")


This changes the path so that when I "import", it will look in the current directory.

Next I do File / New Window to open an editor window, and in that new window I select File / Save As.  It starts in the Python home directory so I have to navigate to W:/mytest.  I save this (empty) file as "test1.py".

I type this into my test1.py file and save it again:

""" test1.py is my test
"""

print ("This is test1.")

class Test1:
    def __init__(self):
        print ("Constructed")


This is a contrived example that can be run as a script or imported as a module.

So I have two windows now; an editor window and the Idle "Python Shell".  I can do this in the Python Shell:

&gt;&gt;&gt; execfile("test1.py")
This is test1.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import test1
This is test1
&gt;&gt;&gt; tt = test1.Test1()
Constructed

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Push new to start making your own script file.  Then when you are ready to test click run and then you can watch the results in the interactive mode, and even try new things as if you were adding code to the end of your script file, its a very useful app for debugging, testing and trying new things.

Also in the options you can change the way python opens your scripts when you click edit from windows, you can set it so that it opens the interactive shell or just the editor.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
use new window tool in the file icon,in the python idle itself to write a program
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
To start coding in a file, just open a new file and start typing.
