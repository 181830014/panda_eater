git blame (docs)
git-blame shows what revision and author last modified each line of a file.
Usage examples
When you are interested in finding the origin for lines 40-50 for file foo, you can use the -L option like so (they mean the same thing — both ask for 11 lines starting at line 40):
git blame -L 40,50 foo.txt
git blame -L 40,+11 foo.txt

You can specify a revision for git blame to look back starting from (instead of the default of HEAD) if you want to find out who edited that lines before a specific commit (fe25b6d in this example; fe25b6d^ is the parent of fe25b6d):
git blame -L 40,+11 fe25b6d^ -- foo.txt

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
git log (docs)
git-log shows commit logs.
Usage example
You can specify -L option to trace the evolution of the line range given by &quot;,&quot;. You can specify this option more than once.
git log -L 40,50:foo.txt

Description: 
    
    
                    
While changing the values of a widget in properties tab, AndroidStudio keeps on throwing IndexNotReadyException. But after few minutes while retrying, the error is not occurring.

Here is the error log:

Answer 1: 

    
    
Happens because of the background indexing processes.

When the IDE is indexing, if we try to change the values in properties tab, then IndexNotReadyException is thrown.

Wait till indexing is complete.

Title: How can I get Eclipse to scroll past the bottom of the document?
Description: 
    
    
                    
When I scroll to the bottom of an open document in the Eclipse editor, the last line is at the bottom of the file.  This is a tad annoying when editing code at the bottom of the file / screen.

How can I enable Eclipse to scroll (much like Vim or VS) down far enough that the last line of code reaches the top of the editor window?

I'm asking for the reverse of this question, in Eclipse: How to make Visual Studio editor stop scrolling past bottom of a file?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Considering the current implementation of a Scrollbar, this is not possible.
(See org.eclipse.swt.widgets.ScrollBar.java)


  At any given moment, a given scroll bar will have a single 'selection' that is considered to be its value, which is constrained to be within the range of values the scroll bar represents (that is, between its minimum and maximum values).


In the JDT (Java Editor) realm, the range is strongly linked to the number of lines a source file has.
Adding artificial "logical lines" to allows scrolling past the last line would have unintended consequences on many other parts of the JDT, related to displaying informations based on the line number of a source file (like a compilation error red underline).

This is also why there is no soft wrapping in those editors, despite 
a 7-years old bug 35779 (one of the most upvoted).


  Allowing word/soft wrap in the editor while typing is easy but not enough, a mapping between the model lines and the visual lines must be introduced to e.g. correctly show annotations.
  It also introduces various problems that need to be solved, e.g. 'Go to Line': tools like a debugger, compiler etc. will report the model line but a user it will look strange that a different line will be selected than the one entered into the 'Go to Line' dialog


So for now, the SWT scrollbar example is still limited by the bottom of the window:


    
    
Title: What is &#39;Facet&#39; in JavaEE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I wonder not only what is Facet but also what is Facet 'in physical level' (as I understand it's not a separate jar, but what?)?

I also wonder how can it affect my application after deploying. I'll explain on real example:

I had 2 facets (which were created by IDE): Spring Facet and Web Facet (for jsf). I deployed it to Tomcat and my application worked fine.

Then I added (by means of IDE) one more facet - JPA Facet. I redeployed application and.. it still worked fine :) 

So, I'm just curious what is that and why do we need it?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is not Java EE related. This is IDE related. The term is at its own not programming related.

From http://www.thefreedictionary.com/facet


  fac·et (fst) n.
  
  
  One of the flat polished surfaces cut on a gemstone or occurring
  naturally on a crystal.
  Anatomy A small, smooth, flat surface, as on a bone or tooth.
  Biology One of the lenslike visual units of a compound eye, as of an
  insect.
  One of numerous aspects, as of a subject. See Synonyms at phase.
  


It's 4.

In this specific case it's just an aspect which is to be used in the project, so that the IDE can intercept on it with regard to generators, wizards, auto-include libraries and so on. If you add for example the JPA facet, then you will get more options to do the IDE-magic with JPA.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
As BalusC said, this is not Java EE related but IDE related. This allows to add "characteristics" to a project in a flexible way.

From the IntelliJ IDEA Q&amp;A for Eclipse Users (because you mentioned IDEA):


  Q: Facets — what they are for?
  
  A: To streamline the project configuration.
  
  Facets encapsulate the support for a
  variety of frameworks, technologies
  and languages. For example, to enable
  Spring in your project, you only have
  to add the corresponding facet. All
  libraries are downloaded and
  configured, you get the full range of
  coding assistance, refactorings, etc.
  Moreover, the code model is also
  recognized, so you are completely free
  from worrying about any configuration
  issues.
  
  In most cases, you can add more than
  one facet of the same type to your
  project. For example, you can have
  multiple Web facets for deploying the
  application to different servers, or
  several EJB facets, each for its own
  EJB version. (See also Project
  Configuration.)


And yes, Eclipse uses "Facets" too:



AFAIK, NetBeans doesn't (see Q: How do I configure a web framework for my project?).
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
As explained in Eclipse &amp; Intellij documentation, Facets define characteristics and requirements (certain configuration, specific for a particular framework/technology).

When you add a facet to a project, that project is configured to perform a certain task, fulfill certain requirements, or have certain characteristics.

In Brief You Have to Follow Some structure to Implement some framework/technology. IDEs have options to implement it for you to make your life easier.

To elaborate it in details I am giving some thorough details directly from Eclipse Documentations. This is Eclipse specific.

While creating a project you will get the option to implement facet for your project. For example, the EAR facet sets up a project to function as an enterprise application by adding a deployment descriptor and setting up the project's classpath.

To add another facet to a project that already exists, complete the following steps:


In the Project Explorer view of the Java™ EE perspective, right-click the project and then select Properties.
Select the Project Facets page in the in the Properties window. This page lists the facets in the project and their versions.
Click Modify Project and select the check boxes next to the facets you want the project to have.


Note: Only the facets that are valid for the project are listed

Some facets may not work together. Thus, you can also choose a preset combination of facets from the Presets list.


Choose a version number for the facet by clicking the current version number and selecting the version number you want from the drop-down list.
Optional: To remove a facet, clear its check box. Not all facets can be removed.
Optional: If you want to limit the project so it will be compatible with one or more runtimes, click on the Runtimes tab and select the runtimes that you want the project to be compatible with. For more information on runtimes, see Specifying target servers for J2EE projects.
Click Finish to exit the Modify Faceted Project dialog and then click OK.


Facets also have version numbers in Eclipse. You can change the version numbers of facets as long as you stay within the requirements for the facets.
To change the version of a facet in your project, complete the following steps:


In the Project Explorer view of the Java EE perspective, right-click the project and then select Properties.
Select the Project Facets page in the in the Properties window. This page lists the facets in the project and their versions.
Click Modify Project and click the facet you want to change.
Select the version of the facet from the drop-down box next to the facet's name.
Click Finish to close the Modify Faceted Project window and then click OK.


You can do more things with the facets. I have given the examples for your better understanding. For details, please go through the documentation of your favorite IDE.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Facets is a web application framework that leverages a simple MVC architecture for the server side and a feature-packed Javascript component model for the client. The two pieces are designed to be seemlessly integrated for very dynamic AJAX-style apps
    
    
Title: PhpStorm - Navigate to method
Description: 
    
    
                    
In a class, I quickly want to navigate to, let's say, the indexAction method. In SublimeText I could press cmd + R, type 'inde', and hit enter on the dropdown that shows all the results from my search. 

I haven't found this in PhpStorm, is this functionality available?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Navigate | Symbol... (CtrlAltShiftN in the default keymap on Windows/Linux, CmdAltShiftN with Mac OS X keymap, CmdAltO in Mac OS X 10.5+ keymap).

Help | Find Action, type symbol to see shortcut in your keymap.

The above works globally across the project, for the current file only use Navigate | File Structure (or CmdF12 on Mac OS X 10.5+) and start typing the method name to narrow down the results, hit Enter to navigate to the selected method.

Answer 2: 

    
    
I also do this in Sublime Text with CMD + R and then look for the method via @. 

I think the closest way of doing this in PhpStorm 8 &amp; 9 is using the  

CMD + F12 (perhaps CTRL + F12 in Windows)  

which lists all the methods in the current class and then type the name of the method to navigate to it.

OPTIONAL / SUPPLEMENTARY

To avoid confusion from switching to Sublime Text and back to PhpStorm I decided to bind it CMD + R that way I won't have to adjust again. 

In PhpStorm there is an easy way to see if there is a conflict with your keybinding so I decided to migrate my Sublime Text shortcuts to PhpStorm instead of the other way around.

Under PhpStorm &gt; Preferences &gt; Keymap you would see a button just beside the search field and check if your command has a conflict in our case we want to bind CMD + F12 to CMD + R to just try that key stroke if it's bound to other command.

Otherwise bind it to Main Menu &gt; Navigate &gt; File Structure.

Hope that helps.

I have a package structure: com.report.domain.model

I would like to change it to com.reporting.domain.model. When I select Refactor → Rename on package com.report.domain.model, I only see an option to rename 'model'. I have tried switching between Project view and Package, but to no avail. I know how to make this change in Eclipse via Navigator view, but how can I do the same in IntelliJ IDEA?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In the Project Window, click on the Gears icon in the title bar  and deselect "Compact Empty Middle Packages". Then you can separately select the report package and rename it.

See also: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/project-tool-window.html#d242351e401

N.B. As of IntelliJ IDEA 2016.3, there is a bug in the menu and when the option is selected, it has a different label "Hide Empty Middle Packages", see https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-168362.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
To change the full package name:

User jkovacs has already answered this, but I'm going to cover this in a bit more detail. For example, if you want to change com.example.app to my.awesome.game, then:


In your Project pane, click on the little gear icon ()
Uncheck / de-select the Compact Empty Middle Packages option:


Your package directory will now be broken up in individual directories.
Individually select each directory you want to rename, and:


Right-click it
Select Refactor
Click on Rename
In the Pop-up dialog, click on Rename Package instead of Rename Directory
Enter the new name and hit Refactor
Allow a minute to let Android Studio update all changes
Note: When renaming com in Android Studio, it might give a warning. In such case, select Rename All:



Now open your Gradle Build File (build.gradle - Usually app or mobile). Update the applicationId to your new Package Name and Sync Gradle, if it hasn't already been updated automatically:


Done! Anyway, Android Studio needs to make this process a little simpler.

    
    
Title: How to use c++11 to program the Arduino?
Description: 
    
    
                    
How can I use c++11 when programming the Arduino? I would be fine using either the Arduino IDE or another environment. I am most interested in the core language improvements, not things that require standard library changes.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As of version 1.6.6, the Arduino IDE enables c++11 by default.

For older versions, read on:

It is very easy to change the flags for any element of the toolchain, including the assembler, compiler, linker or archiver.

Tested on the Arduino IDE version 1.5.7 (released on July 2014),


Locate the platform.txt file,


AVR architecture =/lili
Answer 2: 

    
    
Arduino IDE 1.6.6 and newer have C++11 enabled by default (they have the compiler flag "-std=gnu++11" set in the platform.txt file).
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Firstly, only gcc 4.7 and above (and therefore avr-gcc 4.7 and above) support C++11. So, check the versions installed with :

gcc --version
avr-gcc --version


If avr-gcc is 4.7 or higher, then you may be able to use C++11.

The Arduino IDE does not support custom compiler flags. This has been requested but has not yet been implemented.  

So, you are left with having to use other environments or to compile your program directly from the command line.

In case, of compiling directly from the command line using avr-gcc, you simply need to add an extra compiler flag for enabling C++11 support.

-std=c++11


For specific development environments, most would support editing of the compiler flags from the build options within the IDE. The above mentioned flag needs to be added to the list of flags for each environment.



C++0x was the name of working draft of the C++11 standard. C++0x support is available gcc 4.3 onwards. However, this is strictly experimental support so you cannot realiably expect C++11 features to be present. Here is the complete list of features available with the corresponding version of gcc. The availability of features in avr-gcc will be the same as whats available in the corresponding gcc version.

The compiler flag for C++0x is :

-std=c++0x

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Please, note, that there is no easy way to specify additional flags from Arduino IDE or use other IDE (Eclipse, Code Blocks, etc) or command line.

As a hack, you can use a small proxy program (should be cross-platform):

    vector&lt;string&gt; arguments;
    vector&lt;const char*&gt; aptrs;

    // Additional options, one per line
    ifstream cfg((string(argv[0]) + ".ini").c_str());
    if (cfg.bad())
        cerr &lt;&lt; "Could not open ini file (you're using proxy for some reason, er?)" &lt;&lt; endl;

    string arg;
    while (cfg) {
        getline(cfg, arg);
        if(arg == "\r" || arg == "\n")
            continue;
        arguments.push_back(arg);
    }

    for (const string&amp; arg : arguments)
        aptrs.push_back(arg.c_str());

    for (int i = 1; i &lt; argc; ++i)
        aptrs.push_back(argv[i]);

    // Add null pointer at the end, execvp expects NULL as last element
    aptrs.push_back(nullptr);

    // pass the vector's internal array to execvp
    const char **command = &amp;aptrs[0];

    return execvp(command[0], command);
}



Compile the program.
Rename the original avr-g++.exe to avr-g++.orig.exe (or any other name).
Create avr-g++.ini file where the first line is FULL path to the original program (e.g. D:\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\bin\avr-g++.orig.exe) and add additional parameters, one per line, as desired. 


You're done!

Example avr-g++.ini:

D:\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\bin\avr-g++.orig.exe
-std=c++0x


Hope, that helps!

I use Ino and this worked:

ino build -cppflags="-std=c++0x"

This generated a hex file at least 15k in size (that's with optimizations turned on), compared to about 5k for the standard build, which is a consideration for a poor little Atmega328.  Might be okay for one of the microcontrollers with a lot more program space.
    
    
Title: IntelliJ Idea 12 + Android + Scala nowadays
Description: 
    
    
                    
As suggested to me, I've run through a few articles describing how to make IntelliJ Idea and Android and Scala work together, but it turned out they were all written 1 or 2 years ago. And likely, something has changed since that time and now there are other solutions to achieve this goal. Concretely, there is a new solution https://github.com/yareally/android-scala-intellij-no-sbt-plugin for  which I don't know if it works well or not.

I have IntelliJ Idea 12, Android SDK, Scala, SBT and all other stuff installed and set up. The only thing remaining is to setup IntelliJ Idea 12 to make it work with Scala instead of Java for creating Android applications. 

Please don't close the question. I saw the previous questions similar to mine, but, as I said, they were outdated.

The question is, how do I do it now (May 2013)?

P.S. I tried Android Development Studio but I even wasn't able to launch it due to many errors.

Update: You can read the tutorial I wrote about the upcoming new version of SBT-Android (0.7). Most of your concerns should be addressed there. If they are not, then that's a problem.



Update 2: For fairness's sake, there's also a great work in progress : android-sdk-plugin by @pfn on GitHub.

Regarding ProGuard and build times :


I am, myself, preloading large libraries on my device with sbt-android. This eliminates ProGuard altogether, but requires root.
android-sdk-plugin's latest version boasts a new ProGuard cache (same as AndroidProguardScala), which is pretty sweet and does eliminate ProGuard in most cases during development.




I've been contributing to SBT-Android for a few months now, so I know it a lot better than the other solutions.

As of now, the plugin is evolving rapidly, with :


Full IntelliJ support (thanks to SBTIdea) coming very soon (In fact, it already works, I just need to send the pull requests)
Automatically preload Scala on an emulator, or rooted device (Just run android:preload-{device, emulator}, no Proguard needed for development anymore!)
Should support simple Gradle projects out-of-the-box with minimal effort (The directory structure is very similar)
Configuration is a lot easier (Just add the plugin and a project file and you're set!)


The current version doesn't have most of these niceties, but they're coming up in the following weeks. Some documentation is of course going to follow very soon afterwards, with examples and everything I'll think of.

I encourage you to join the Scala on Android Google Group and share your thoughts, by the way. There's also a #sbt-android channel on Freenode if you're into IRC.

Just wanted to chime in on this.  I used https://github.com/yareally/android-scala-intellij-no-sbt-plugin, although I found the instructions to be vague, not having ever used IntelliJ before this.

You've probably got it all sorted out by now and are happy with SBT, but for my purposes I just wanted to test Scala on Android without all the extra bells and whistles. So, here are some little things I had to do to get the no-sbt-plugin stuff working:

I ended up including the scala-compiler.jar (along with the scala-library.jar and scala-reflect.jar) as a Global Library:


That way, the compiler has access to the library &amp; reflection code, otherwise I was getting errors. If you don't include the library, the IDE complains that the compiler needs an associated library, and if you don't include reflect it spits out a bunch of errors at compile time that it cannot find reflect class definitions.

I had to include scala-library.jar as a module dependency as well (which had the side effect of including it under the Libraries section also):


Before doing all that, I had the Scala plugin installed, created an Android project, and simply added a Scala facet (ignore the memory settings, I was fooling around):


Finally, I had to resolve some remaining compilation errors by adding a few "-dontwarn" lines to the proguard txt file. Simple enough.

Works like a charm. Haven't done anything substantial with it yet, but am looking forward to using Scala on my next Android project.

I wrote the Scaloid library that makes Android development more concisely with Scala.

For a quick starting point, I wrote a hello-world maven project for Scala+Android.

I use Intellij as a main IDE, and it imports the project with a charm.

I've gone through this about a month ago and I managed to make it work quite nicely using Gradle. 

Here is the outcome: https://github.com/ghik/akkdroid

This is a simple client-server project using Scala and Akka, with client-side on Android, developed with IntelliJ IDEA. I know that client-server doesn't really make sense with Akka, but that's just a simple university project to prove that these technologies can work together.

Note however that gradle script in this project is meant only to generate IDEA project, it has to be further extended to be able to perform proper Android application build.

I have been watching this thread for several months, finally got some time to do the real tests.

Using IntelliJ 13 with SBT 0.13 and Scala 2.10.3.


The SBT-Android hasn't been updated for several months. I found the instructions were outdated and I didn't manage to create a working project.
The android-sdk-plugin worked. Just followed the simple steps and I got "hello world" running on my phone. But importing the SBT project into IntelliJ will not work properly, will need some project modifications manually.
I have also tried to create an Android project first then add Scala framework, but didn't work out as I was expecting.

    
    
Title: How to generate a void method in IntelliJ IDEA?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Eclipse, when I type main ctr+space, it will generate a static void main method for me. And when I type methodName ctr+space, smart code completion will suggest generating the method named methodName.

How can I auto-generate a void method in IntelliJ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
To create a new method from usage in the code like:

...
someMethodName()
...


AltEnter on the red code:



It's also possible to type void methodName() and use Complete Statement (CtrlShiftEnter), it will become:

void methodName() {
    |
}


You could create your own Live Template as @Makoto answered, but programming by intention seems to be more natural. When you don't have a method, you write code that will use it, then create the method from the intention action - this way IDEA will generate the method signature automatically according to the parameters and return type in the not yet existing method usage, like String result = someMethod(stringParam);.

Finally, it is worth nothing that in IntelliJ IDEA main() method can be generated using psvmTab.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
IntelliJ IDEA 15

Generate a main method


Default:

Type psvm (public static void main) kbd/kbd/p/lilipcode/codecode/code/pullipstrong/strong
Answer 3: 

    
    

Type the abbreviation of the main() method template:

Press the template invocation key. By default, it is Tab. The abbreviation expands to the main() method.

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
IntelliJ makes use of Live Templates to do its code completion.  It's then a matter of deciding what shorthand name you wish to use to name your void method.

Here's an example.  Create a live template in Settings /ppcode/codecode/codecode/code/pprecode/code/prepcode/codecode/codekbd/kbdcode/code/p/div

Title: Angular2 - how to start and with which IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have used AngularJS 1.x now for a couple of months. Now I will switch to Angular2 (with TypeScript) and actually I am not sure which IDE to use.
It is also not clear for me how to compile the TypeScript Code into JavaScript - actually is this necessary?
I have read that Visual Studio Code would be a nice editor for Angular2 projects - is there a TypeScript compiler included? I would be glad for any information in this direction.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
1) IDE

I was wondering myself which IDE is the best suited for Angular2.

I'm a big Sublime Text supporter and even tho there's a Typescript plugin ... It didn't feel perfect with Typescript power.

So I tried with my second favourite editor : Atom (+ Typescript plugin).
Better BUT no support for auto import (maybe it has some now ?) and also, I had to wait 30s before I get any autocompletion.

Then I tried Webstorm as the company I'm currently working at has some licences. It was great and I was really happy for a month. But using an editor that is not free felt ... weird. I wouldn't use it at home for personal projects, I couldn't recommend it to other people easily. And honnestly, I'm not a super fan of Webstorm interface.

So I gave (another) try to Visual Studio Code that I didn't find so great when I first tried it few months ago. It has seriously evolved and :
- it's simple
- it's complete

I had the same problem, because since Angular 2 was released I am looking good freeware IDE which supports Angular 2. I will describe my experience.

NETBEANS

It's very good IDE for Java and quite good for Web development. There is many features that boost your work. I installed plugin Everlaw Typescript that is maintained on github:

Plugin: https://github.com/Everlaw/nbts/releases

Advantages


Typescript actions (build, run etc.) are available from project explorer.
Plugin can build TS files on save.


Disadvantages


Lack of support Angular 2, because this plugin support only typescript.
Troubles with intelisense and syntax highlighting in angular template files and ts files.
Lack of boilerplate templates for NG2.


ECLIPSE

IMHO Eclipse with Angular2Eclipse plugin now is one of the best IDE for Angular 2 purpose. It is mature solution with many features that boost your work.

Plugin: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/angular2-eclipse

Advantages


Integration with angular-cli
Support for Angular2 syntax inside the component templates.
Support for typescript files.
Available Angular 2 boilerplate templates.


Disadvantages

IMHO there is no disadvantages.

If you are looking for good tutorial how to configure IDE try this

https://jaxenter.com/angular-2-intellij-netbeans-eclipse-128461.html

VS Code + Angular Language Service

Since angular released language service, I've changed IDE to VS Code. I've worked on eclipse but now I think VS Code is better because is quite faster and more lighter than eclipse with angular addon.


  The Angular Language Service is a way to get completions, errors, hints, and navigation inside your Angular templates whether they are external in an HTML file or embedded in annotations/decorators in a string.


You can read more here https://angular.io/guide/language-service

If You want to install that addon, launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.

ext install Angular.ng-template

Title: When does IDE0063 dispose?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to understand this C# 8 simplification feature:


  IDE0063 'using' statement can be simplified


For example, I have:

void Method()
{
    using (var client = new Client())
    {
        // pre code...
        client.Do();
        // post code...
    } --&gt; client.Dispose() was called here.
    // more code...
}


IDE tells me I can simplify this using statement by writing this instead:

void Method()
{
    using (var client = new Client());
    // pre code...
    client.Do();
    // post code...
    // more code...
}


I can't understand how it works and how it decides I'm not using the variable anymore. More specifically, when exactly does it call client.Dispose method?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You are using C# 8. In older C# versions that ; would have made this invalid. 

In the new syntax, the client stays in scope for the surrounding method (or other {} scope block). Note that you can omit the outer pair of () as well.

It's called a using declaration, the documentation is here.

void Method()
{
    using var client = new Client();
    // pre code...
    client.Do();
    // post code...
    // more code...
} --&gt; client.Dispose() is called here (at the latest)


Logically the Dispose happens at the } but the optimizer might do it earlier. 

Edit

I noticed that having // more code after the end of the using block, prevents this improvement from appearing. So there will be no more ambiguity if you convert the following code:

void Method()
{
    // not relevant code

    using (var client = new Client())
    {
        // pre code...
        client.Do();
        // post code...
    }
}


into this code:

void Method()
{
    // not relevant code

    using var client = new Client();
    // pre code...
    client.Do();
    // post code...
}

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The short answer is that the new (optional) using statement syntax inherits its parent's scope.

I have to agree with the OP that this is a very confusing change in C# 8.0, for many reasons.

Historically, using has always operated with a scope like other blocks (if, switch, etc.). And like if, the using statement's scope was the next line or block of code.

So it is perfectly valid to write something like:

using (var client = new Client())
    client.Do();


This means client is only in scope for the single statement, which is great for single-line operations, like triggering a SQL stored procedure with no return value.

But now we also have:

using var client = new Client();
client.Do();


Which is not the same thing at all; client remains in-scope for the entire method.

Now, Visual Studio will only suggest this change if nothing came after your original using block, so it's functionally identical.  But what if more code is added later? With the old scope notation, it was very clear whether the new code was in or out of scope.  With the new syntax, everything after using is in scope, but that might not be clear.

The Roslyn team may have figured that this doesn't really matter.  Unlike flow control statements (if, etc.), do you really care if your object stays in scope for a few more lines of code?  Probably not. But like all things, it depends.

In some ways, it's an improvement since it clearly says, "Instantiate this object and call Dispose() when it goes out of scope."  Objects are always destroyed and garbage collected when they go out of scope (i.e. method ends) but that does not mean that Dispose() is called.  Adding using to a local variable declaration is just a way of making that happen.

Finally, and this is big, if you are targeting .NET Framework, you're probably not really using C# 8.0.

You may think you are; I did. You may be running Visual Studio 2019 16.3+. You may even have the latest version of the Microsoft.Net.Compilers package installed, and that says you're getting C# 8.0, right? But you're not. By default, .NET Framework is capped at C# 7.3.

In my tests, when I target .NET 4.8, Visual Studio is smart and won't offer C# 8.0 suggestions. But if I target an older version (4.7.2) I do get this suggestion, which then generates a build error. The IDE won't show you that error - your project looks clean - but you'll get two syntax errors when you actually build.

When targeting .NET 4.8, if you do try and use C# 8.0 syntax you'll get the friendly 


  CS8370 C# Feature is not available in C# 7.3. Please use language version 8.0 or greater.


and an offer to add &lt;LangVersion&gt;8.0&lt;/LangVersion&gt; to your project file (even though that's officially unsupported by Microsoft). It works, with caveats.  But with older .NET versions that doesn't seem to be the case. So show extreme caution when accepting these new syntax hints on older projects!

UPDATE: I was wrong about older NET Framework versions triggering the hint. The culprit was an old version (2.10.0) of Microsoft.Net.Compilers. That was the last version compatible with older versions of Visual Studio. After removing that package, the hint is no longer offered.

Answer 1: 

    
    
The crash is generally a sign the project file has been corrupted. Here's a list of possible things you can do to try to fix it.

1. Fix a corrupted *.pbxproj file

Caused by a merge conflict

If you are using version control, it might be caused by a merge conflict that has not yet been resolved. 


Using Finder, open the directory that holds your project.
Right click the project file YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.xcodeproj and Open With your preferred text editing tool such as Sublime Text.
Look for merge conflicts which are usually marked using a series of ========= bars.
Resolve the merge conflicts manually or remove the changes of one side.


Caused by unreadable XML

If that fails go into the file and quickly scroll through to see if anything seems out of place - it should generally be readable XML.  You could even try an XML validator against it to see if anything amiss was found.

2. Reset your workspace


Using Finder, open the directory that holds yor project.
Right click the project file MyProject.xcodeproj and choose Show Package Contents.
Delete the xcuserdata folder, which should contain a folder with your username on it.
Repeats step 2 and 3 for your workspace file MyProject.workspace


As elaborated by KennyWinker and Paul R on the answers below.

3. Recreate your Xcode project

Note that this should be your last resort as it is quite tedious to do for large projects.

Lastly you could simply re-create it.  That might seem like a big pain, but basically you could just create a new project and drag everything under the "Classes" folder into Xcode to start using it (don't forget to also add the frameworks you need).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Just wanted to elucidate on @Paul R's comment.

I had a situation where Xcode was crashing every time I opened a project file. It seemed to be connect to the IB window that was opening. In the end it was deleting the contents of MyProject.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/ that solved this. It did this by resetting the workspace (open files, window scaling, etc.)

Hope this is helpful.

What worked for me?

The only solution that worked for me was deleting the derived data folders of the hanging project, i.e the derived data folders in above directory: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/. Hope it helps someone.

What didn't?

As mentioned at other places, deleting MyProject.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/ or MyProject.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/ didn't work for me.

Just wanted add some extra content to @Kenny Winker answer...

To delete your xcode user data go,


Find your Xcode project file ex: MyProject.xcodeproj or MyProject.xcworkspace
Right click on it and choose Show Package Contents
Finally, just delete everything inside the folder xcuserdata
Done! :)


Hopefully, this adds a bit more context to people who doesn't know where to find their project user data.

I had similar problem with Xcode 8.1. The reason maybe the project file contains merge conflict data.
You can remove this by opening Xcode project file in TextEdit.

However, in my case there was no merge conflict. Simply deleting content of DerivedData worked for me.

Steps :


Open finder window then select Go Tab -&gt; Go to Folder… (or press Cmd + shift + G)





Enter ~/Library and press Go. This opens Library folder which is hidden by default.





Go to Developer -&gt; Xcode -&gt; DerivedData folder. Delete all the content of this folder.
The DerivedData is like cache i.e. create every time you build/run your app.





Now open the project. It should work with no issues.

Copying Answer of @Sean D which worked for me.

After seeing a suggestion here, I solved this issue by deleting Xcode's preferences. The most reliable way to do that is the following terminal command, issued after quitting Xcode:

defaults delete com.apple.dt.Xcode


ETA: Other suggestions have involved changing or removing certain individual preference settings, but after trying a few of those, none worked for me. There seem to be multiple incompatibilities in the preferences between 6 and 7b3, so trashing the prefs entirely should work around them all.

Same thing happened to me, and it was some sort of versioning issue that I couldn't fix, so I reverted back to a prior version and it worked. Feels like there are a few bugs in XCode 4 that still need to be worked out.

If you have any open swift file in a new window (for example when you double click on a .swift file in xCode and it opens in a new window) when xCode opens this might be an issue. I think I had this window opened when closing xCode, then when opening xCode this window opens up again and for some reason crashes xCode. Try to close that open window quickly before it crashes. Strange, but that worked for me.

I experienced XCode crashing when trying to edit a specific original.m file. None of the above solutions worked, but this did:


Create a new .m file as new.m for example.
Using a text editor open up original.m outside XCode, copy contents and paste into new.m inside XCode. Go back to working in XCode.
Delete and move to trash the original.m 
Rename new.m to original.m
Now I can edit original.m without XCode crashing.

In my case there were two windows, one on the internal screen of my MacBook and one on an external each with several tabs opened before Xcode crashed and kept crashing on trying to open the xcworkspace file.

Title: Eclipse webtools project (WTP) and its performance / quality
Description: 
    
    
                    
Our company is using eclipse since several years now (we are using WTP since release 0.7)

I am currently evaluating eclipse 3.6.2 with WTP 3.2.3 which should replace eclipse 3.4.2 with WTP 3.0.4 as being our main IDE.

And I have to say that once again I am quite disappointed in concerns of performance:
WTP 3.2.3 seems to be much slower than 3.0.4.
In fact I am really wondering why WTP gets slower with each release.

One of our applications (dynamic web project) contain about 4000 java classes and 700 jsps/jsp fragments. We only need basic WTP functionality for developing jsps, xmls and xsd. We don't need high sophistic features like Dali (should JPA tools really covered by a webtools project?), Libra or a visual xml editor in the first place.

Another interesting point is that WTP seems to slow down the whole IDE.
SWT is non-reponsive for some fraction of seconds, cpu usage is very high (especially after a built took place - if you look at the system jobs, several jsp/javascript indexers are doing work for some minutes, even if all WTP build validators have been disabled), opening new files are slower, navigating through the project etc.

This can be especially seen on older machines which do contains only a single core cpu.

The worst thing is that I've got the feeling that the WTP dev team does not care much about performance
(e.g. have a look at the http://wiki.eclipse.org/WTP_Performance_Tests page - last update took place in 2008).

Bug reports and Newsgroup posts regarding to performance of basic features (e.g. jsp editing/validating) are often ignored or closed after some time, some examples: here, here, and here.

Quo vadis, WTP?



Please don't get me wrong:

I don't want to blame WTP.
In fact I believe that WTP is a good open-source project developed by a talented team.
But obviously the project has a problem with its quality assurance, especially in terms of performance which affects usability and user acceptance.

I just want to point out that the team should focus on the things which are essential to most of the users in the first place and afterwards work on implementing super-duper-features.

My Questions


What are your experiences with WTP, especially the most recent releases?
Can you confirm or disprove my observations?
Are there better alternatives?
Did you switch from or to WTP and why?
Do you have some best practices to speed it up, especially for upper-mid-sized like ours?




UPDATE

I'd like to make an update on this question to reflect the current answers and 
to sum up the current results:


Many users complain about more or less on the same issues so I see those issues as confirmed.
BTW, this question is also mentioned on a news post on theserverside.com with additional comments.
The responsible WTP project lead, nitind, made a notable post on the current situation of WTP, which I like to cite:
"The simple fact is that we don't spend much time on performance tests because we lack resources for doing that."
"Of course we'd like to be proactive about it rather than reactive, but we tend to allocate our time to functional problems first."


So this question turns a little bit into some kind of an open letter from the community to the WTP team:

Dear WTP team,

it's obvious that WTP is suffering from major quality/performance issues 
which you try to play down or to ignore.
Please invest some time to improve the current situation 
at the cost of new features and do everything what's required 
to solve the current problems.
E.g. revive the performance team, do some regression tests between 
previous releases or ask the community for (precise defined) help.

I am sure that they are enough people willing and able to help here.

If you like, do some kind of poll to get a feeling what should be 
the most important scopes of future's WTP releases.

Please, please, listen to your community.

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
To respond, I'm the lead for the projects that supply the JSP, XML, and JavaScript source editing functionality in WTP.  The simple fact is that we don't spend much time on performance tests because we lack resources for doing that.  Of course we'd like to be proactive about it rather than reactive, but we tend to allocate our time to functional problems first.  We do have an adopter product running performance regression tests regularly, but I expect that tests are run on multi-core machines by now--and we haven't had any new red flags reported to us for some time.

Of the 3 bugs you linked to, 2 predate the 3.0.4 version you laud and the third is either a formatting performance issue (since addressed) or one with as-you-type validation specific to XML files (the fixing of which would have triggered a memory leak in Xerces, iirc, hence us not putting it in at that time).  If you have concrete projects that you can attach to a bug and say "doing X is slower in 3.2 by Y amount", we'll do what we can to figure out where there's a regression.

As for the indexers, they should at least eventually complete.  The on-disk information that is stored has changed between WTP versions, and those files need to be reprocessed so they're again included in search and (where implemented) refactoring operations.  Once the initial indexing is complete, it should act incrementally and be virtually unnoticeable.  One architectural change you may be running into is that for JSPs, the entire workspace needs to be indexed in a single workbench session for that index to be considered "up to date".  Shutting down Eclipse out of frustration will only prolong the impact of that reprocessing.

It sounds like your company's standard install includes the entirety of WTP rather than rolling your own custom distribution.  I urge you to check the Startup and Shutdown preference page and turn off early startup of any functionality you're not interested in using.  Nothing you've mentioned interest in makes use of that facility, but there are other areas of WTP and the Platform that do.  Anything you're not interested in validating is fair game on the Validation preference page, as well as the setting to validate JSP fragments by default on the Web / JSP Files / Validation preference page.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
We have the same problem with WTP 3.2.3 here, too. We use it in our product for several years, too but the acceptance of our developers and customers in this tool is decreasing every year because in every newer release it is slower and slower. 

I would like to use it if I could disable all "advanced" features but as you mentioned you cannot disable the indexers at all. Also you cannot stop the validator of JSP files if it is already running (you can test this if you have that many files as you have and we also have around 1000 JSP files and many tag files in our project). 

I also can prove that increasing the memory does not help. It only prevents crashes of the whole eclipse but it does not reduce the UI blocking internal operations of WTP.

In the newest version 3.2.3 I got many hangs when I start Tomcat from within the servers view. The UI just hangs about 1 minute. It's not only me who has the hangs, it's all my colleagues who work on Windows have the same problem. On Linux I do not know about this problem.

Also there are problems in WTP when you have no access to the internet. It seems there are request to some registries to download schemas or such things and if you do not have a connection then it just hangs and waits for the time out.  
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I don't know who's to blame: WTP or JBoss Tools.
The fact is that, as I work with GWT (minimal JSP), I went the opposite way: No WTP at all!!! I'm now using plain Eclipse for Java, and use a run configuration to deploy (programatically invoking ANT) and start the server, and I never looked back!!!
Eclipse used to take ~1.5GB and crashed several times. Now, it sits on ~800MB, and the whole environment became more stable.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I have seen similar effects, here's one solution that might be suitable in some project environments...

To guarantee fast and responsible Eclipse Web project environment, consider this:


Use Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

98MB version is leaner than 200MB EE version
from General / Startup and Shutdown, disable all but "Eclipse UI"
from Validation, disable validators which you do not need
these probably prevent some performance issues (YMMW) 

Use Jetty

you do not need WTP or any other plugins, it's pure Java
like Tomcat but very quick &amp; simple to install into any IDE / environment
embed directly into your project files, configure once for every developer
works in any IDE (Eclipse, IDEA, JDeveloper..)
start Servlet Container with "Debug As" / "Run As"
shutdown Servlet Container by clicking red box on Eclipse console
IDE Console, debugging &amp; hot code replacement &amp; JRebel works fine



Result: fast &amp; responsive Eclipse when compared to many other Eclipse installations that use Eclipse EE version with WTP stuff.

Why? It might be that some Eclipse feature or plugin contains bugs or simply uses resources in a bad way and this makes Eclipse UI sluggish.

Non-Java EE Eclipse is good enough even for many Java EE project environments, it all depends on your architecture and what tools you are using..

Here's a quick tutorial to get started in case you wish to try Jetty Servlet Container out with Eclipse. See https://vaadin.com/web/jani/home/-/blogs/vaadin-for-everyone-how-to-get-started . Download VaadinProjectForAnyIDE.zip, it's an Eclipse project. Just ignore that Vaadin stuff and replace HelloWorldApplication.java with your own servlet and edit web.xml accordingly.

One more thing. With Eclipse EE version, you might also wish to try J2EE preview server which actually is Jetty embedded into Eclipse bundle. However, this also uses WTP mechanism.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I also think the stability and performance of Eclipse/WTP is somewhat alarming. I'm using Eclipse since mid 2003 and have been trying WTP since its very first releases.

At first the quality was absolute abysmal, but for a 0.x version I couldn't complain of course. While waiting for WTP to mature, I used MyEclipse, which was sort of okay but had its flaws too (and being partially based on WTP, inherited some of WTP).

When MyEclipse became heavier and heavier, slower and slower and we ran into several stability issues, we switched to 'pure WTP'. All we were using was really the basic JSP/JSF editor and deployer.

Since WTP doesn't do incremental deployment (at least not for the JBoss server runtime) we added the separate server runtime from JBoss tools. When we adopted Facelets, we also switched to the editor from JBoss tools.

We do however run into a lot of problems we also had with MyEclipse. There are unexplainable slowdowns, but much worse are various stability problems. There are lots of awkward exceptions and crashes. A typical .log file on many different workstations I examined is chockfull of exceptions. A small selection of the last 10 exceptions in my log:

Note that these are just the last 10, there are many, many more exceptions.

The casual reaction would be: "Your Eclipse install is corrupted! You have a local problem!" Yes, I might have a local problem, but this "local problem" seems widespread as many Eclipse installs I inspected seem to have this stuff in their logs.

I'm also having problems with deployments like reported at the following link in various incarnations: http://community.jboss.org/thread/158611 It may be JBoss tools specific or it may be based on the underlying WTP or even Eclipse code. I don't know, but I do know it's a nasty problem. Every WTP and JBoss tools version there is 'something' fixed, and every version a problem like that resurfaces in a slightly different form.

Between the stability problems I'm able to get some work done and I love the auto completion and navigate-into features the editors offer me (which keeps me from switching to a text editor and building completely on the command line), but I sure would love some increased stability.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
By far the best way for speeding up my projects has been to precompile code that I am not currently using. We have about 20 projects that make up our system and when working on any specific problem I'm only touching a specific subset of those java files. Compiling most of the code that I won't be touching and throwing it into some .jar's, then using that as the source instead of including the projects has proven to speed up things by quite a bit. I imagine it will help you as well if you have 4k+ files.
Each project just has a little build.xml that will make a jar out of it to include.

As for the mind numbing slowness in the JSP editing. I have the same problems, it's just so dam slow. I don't have many more than 100 jsp files but I have the same issues as you. My solution has just been to throw money at hardware, which I must admit I enjoy doing :P.

To answer the following question:
Do you have some best practices to speed it up, especially for upper-mid-sized like ours?

Turning off validation and auto-building after file-saving is a good start to increase performance.
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
I've disabled the WTP JSP editor for the reasons you mentioned above: It just needs too many resources. Some more things you should consider:


Edit JSPs in the normal HTML editor. That means you don't get code completion which is a good thing. IMO, Mixing Java and HTML is a mistake in the first place and an editor can't fix that. Put all Java code into helper beans (which you can then test easily) and just access the beans from JSP. This should get rid of 99% of all the &lt;% %&gt; tags and solve most of your problems already.
Consider using Spring to be able to build more complex beans and inject them into your JSPs using these patterns: 


How to inject spring beans into a jsp 2.0 SimpleTag?
Use SpringBeanAutowiringSupport:

&lt;%!
    @Autowired
    private Bean bean;

    public void jspInit() {
        SpringBeanAutowiringSupport
        .processInjectionBasedOnServletContext( 
            this, getServletContext()
        );
    }
%&gt;


Try a different VM. WTP editors creates huge amounts of objects and now all VMs (GC implementations) can handle that equally well. If you use Sun's Java, try JRockit or IBMs J9. Also play with the GC settings. Increasing RAM won't help because if you have GC issues, more RAM usually only makes it worse (since the GC will have to process more data).
Precompile as much code as possible. You don't need 4000 classes open at all times on your workspace. Cut your huge project into manageable chunks.
Replace JSPs with plain Java servlets and use HTML rendering libraries like rendersnake or use a programming language which plays more nice with HTML (like Groovy).
Get some decent hardware. A new PC with a quad core and 8GB RAM costs $1000. If you save ten minutes every day, the investment will be paid up in 50 days (at the rate of 1 person costs $1000/day all in all).
Try MyEclipse which has much better web editors. The JSP editor is better than WTP (code completion works most of the time, for example) but it's still sluggish.

    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
WTP (3.2.3) is slow for me too. I belive I have found some ways to make it not so slow:


We use maven, so there is a target directory which contains a copy of all JSP's and some other XML's. I have recognized that they are sometimes scanned by the WTP validators. But this is not necessary, so I have excluded them from validation (Project/Properties/Validation/XXX/Exclude Group/). (You should be able to gain the same effect when marking the target directory as derived, but that does not work for me some times ;-( )
I have made the (not scientifically  proven) observation, that WTP seems to be faster with JSPX than JSP files.

    
    
Answer 10: 

    
    
If you need barebones Java EE then you are better off with Netbeans, if you need everything but just working you are better off with IDEA. It is as simple as that.
    
    
Answer 11: 

    
    
Couldn't comment so I will just put my comment in to this answer.

Have you tried upping Eclipse's memory allocation, I know it used to crash all the time when I used it on Mac OS X awhile ago. There is a config file that has the base RAM allocation in it, once I modified that file and gave it an extra 128 megabytes of memory it behaved better. Not sure if this will affect WTP, I am commenting more in regards to the core Eclipse application itself.

I've recently updated the android studio IDE to 0.8 to work with the new android L SDK. To start I imported a finished android project that receives no errors in the older version of android studio. In version 0.8 i lines such as

Try following these steps from the website:

Create a library project based on the support library code:


Make sure you have downloaded the Android Support Library using the SDK Manager.
Create a library project and ensure the required JAR files are included in the project's build path:

None of the above solutions worked for me. What finally worked was:
Instead of
import android.support.v4.content.FileProvider;

Use this
import androidx.core.content.FileProvider;

This path is updated as of AndroidX (the repackaged Android Support Library).
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
tl;dr Remove all unused modules which have a dependency on the support library from your settings.gradle.

Long version:

In our case we had declared the support library as a dependency for all of our modules (one app module and multiple library modules) in a common.gradle file which is imported by every module. However there was one library module which wasn't declared as a dependency for any other module and therefore wasn't build. In every few syncs Android Studio would pick that exact module as the one where to look for the support library (that's why it appeared to happen randomly for us). As this module was never used it never got build which in turn caused the jar file not being in the intermediates folder of the module.

Removing this library module from settings.gradle and syncing again fixed the problem for us.

For me the problem was caused by a gradle.properties file in the list of Gradle scripts. It showed as gradle.properties (global) and refered to a file in C:\users\.gradle\gradle.properties. I right-clicked on it and selected delete from the menu to delete it. It deleted the file from the hard disk and my project now builds and runs. I guess that the global file was overwriting something that was used to locate the package android.support

Title: Xcode 6 Editor doesn&#39;t recognize unit tests
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a problem that the Xcode IDE 6 doesn't detect my swift unit test cases correctly. When I run the unit tests, all tests were executed.

But in the IDE while editing the unit tests aren't recognized. I have to run the whole unit test suite in order to run a single test.

I couldn't figure out how I avoid this glitch.

The "fix" for me was to add a new test. I made up some nonsense:

func testThatNothing() {
    XCTAssertTrue(true, "True should be true")
}


When I ran the tests again, all the tests in that file were recognized by the editor. I deleted the bogus test and it's all still fine. Unfortunately I had to do this in each file, but at least it works. Hope this helps someone.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Below are few solution for this issue :


Wait for sometime. It takes time to load diamond sometimes. Navigate between different files and then move to same test-case it should appear.
Clean project, Clean build folder and even delete derived data content. Check this how to delete derived data safely.
Quit Xcode and open it again.
Make sure that your test-case name begins with testFunc_Name
Sometimes your test-case file may contain function other than test-case. In such scenario diamond symbol doesn't appears. Remove such function.


In my case 1, 3 and 5 solution often worked for me.

I ran into this problem where adding a new (Swift) test in 6.1 wouldn't make it show up in the "Test Navigator" or the scheme editor -- restarting Xcode fixed the problem and now I can run the tests individually.
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
Xcode 7
My full answer is here.
In Xcode 7 getting Unit Testing set up is a little easier than in Xcode 6 (no need to annotate class and methods as public). Use @testable before the import of the class name.
import XCTest
@testable import MyProject

class MyClassTests: XCTestCase {

    func testMyMethod() {
        
        let myClass = MyClass()
        let sum = myClass.addTwoNumbers(1, 2)
        
        XCTAssertEqual(sum, 3)
    }
}

In your class you don't have to do anything special.
class MyClass {

    func addTwoNumbers(a: Int, b: Int) -&gt; Int {
        return a + b
    }
}

It is possible you may also have to set &quot;Defines Module&quot; under Packaging to YES for your app's Build Settings.

Answer 10: 

    
    
I had a similar error (though in Objective C, not swift).  If I added a new test method to the class, the new method wouldn't show up in the test navigator nor would it be executed when I ran the whole bundle.  I also wouldn't get those dots in the side bar next to each method that, if clicked, would run just one test method. 

The only thing fixed my problem was deleting my whole test class (saving its contents elsewhere temporarily) then recreating the test class and (perhaps more carefully?) setting the build settings all over again. 
    
    
Answer 11: 

    
    
For me it was enough to select Product-&gt;Test and wait a bit. When the tests just start running all the diamonds become available
    
    
Answer 12: 

    
    
In my case I had a reference to an old test target which was causing the issue, so I got rid of the missing target and clean the solution and then my test cases were working fine.



Also make sure that the test methods you create should always start with the keyword "test" else Xcode won't be able to identify the test methods an example of the same is

func test_getPhotos_With_Good_Request_Returns_PhotoCollection(){

    //ARRANGE

    //ACT

   //ASSERT

}

Title: False Unused Import Statement in PyCharm?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Given this scenario:

b.py:

import A
# A is unused here


c.py:

from b import A
# A is used here


PyCharm complains in b.py that "import A" is an unused import and Optimize imports deletes it, breaking import in c.py

I know these chained imports are not a good practice (although you may use it to implement a facade module), but is it me or is it a PyCharm fail?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As far as I can tell this behaviour is not handled as an inspection or some other configurable option, which means there is no #noinspection UnusedImport (or equivalent) that can be placed before the imports.

If you don't want to define an unused block where you use those variables there's an other simple and probably better way to achieve what you want:

#b.py code
import A

# [...] your code


__all__ = ['A', ...]  # *all* the names you want to export


PyCharm is smart enough to look at __all__ and avoid removing A as unused import.
However there's a limitation that __all__ must be a simple list literal. You cannot do things like:

__all__ = ['A'] + [name for name in iterable if condition(name)]


Not even:

x = 'b'
__all__ = ['A', x]


Defining __all__ is a best-practice to make your module *-import safe anyway, so is something you should already do.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can actually use the PyUnresolvedReferences marker to deactivate the inspection for your import statement:

# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
import A


Reference: PyCharm bug PY-2240
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
from C import A, B
_ = (A, B); del _


Works for me. I don't like

# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences


as it would give false negatives in case A cannot be imported. And

__all__ = ['A', 'B', ...]


is cryptic and is not convenient for refactoring.
    
    
Title: Clojure editor/IDE recommendations on Mac OS X
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am starting to learn the Clojure programming language. Are there any recommendations for Clojure editors/IDEs on Mac OS X?

Update 2009-09-23: The Clojure space has changed tremendously since I originally posted this question. Many of the links below, especially those that refer to clojure-mode with Emacs, are out-of-date. The best Clojure IDE I found was the Enclojure Netbeans plugin which was recently released (2009-08-25).

Emacs+SLIME is going to be the most productive if you are going to be spending your time editing Lisp code and not doing much Java.

One of the "big 3" Java development IDEs is IntelliJ IDEA. It used to get less market share because it's not free as in beer. JetBrains is now providing a Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA . I'm not a regular Mac user myself, but the OS X 'I use this' folks say it runs there too.

IDEA has a plugin called La Clojure, available directly from the plugin manager under "Settings," that makes Clojure development pleasant and productive.

Previously, I tried


WaterFront, for which "IDE" is IMO a bit of a reach;
Counterclockwise, a pretty good Eclipse plugin; and
Enclojure, the NetBeans plugin.

Rich Hickey uses Aquamacs in all of his demos.  He has commented about this, saying that he switched to it after someone created a Clojure mode for Emacs.  I have also created a Clojure mode for jEdit.

This is an old question, but the landscape of the Clojure tooling has evolved quite a bit.

IntelliJ + Cursive or La Clojure. Someone once recommended me Cursive.
vim + fireplace. I know some very productive people use it.
Emacs + CIDER and Paredit, my personal choice. Apparently Rich Hickey uses Aquamacs.


I personally learnt to use Emacs to use it with Clojure, although some may argue that learning two things at the same time is not a good idea.

If you wan't to do this because the blocks are so long that can't reconize the structure
you should consider to split if/else blocks into methods using Alt-Shift-M (Extract Method)
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Ok, this is a little bit older, but maybe someone could find this useful:
In most cases you can surround the piece of code by an additional pair of scope brackets, and to remember what you folded you can add a line comment.

For example, if you want to collapse the following:

int SectionA_var1;
int SectionA_var2;
int SectionA_var3;
int SectionA_var4;
int SectionA_var5;
int SectionB_var1;


just add the brackets an the comment:

{ // SectionA
    int SectionA_var1;
    int SectionA_var2;
    int SectionA_var3;
    int SectionA_var4;
    int SectionA_var5;
}
int SectionB_var1;


Then you get the (-) sign and you can collapse the whole section to this:

{ // SectionA[...]
int SectionB_var1;


No plugin necessary, and until now I had no situation where this gave me any downsides, except that you cannot use it on a top level declaration to collapse methods.

So I only recently discovered the TODO comment. For those of you that don't know, most modern IDE's will recognize this word in a comment and flag the comment line a different colour so It stands out.

EG.

//Need to talk to Bill about refactoring this code

//TODO:Need to talk to Bill about refactoring this code


You may notice in IDE's like Eclipse or Rubymine highlight the TODO comment and some nice other features to do with it.

My question is: What other keywords are there like the TODO? It seems like a much better way of communicating to developers through comments and a feature that should be a bit more widely known in IDE's. Their purpose is to help with development after all..

Title: Visual Studio not breaking on user-unhandled exceptions
Description: 
    
    
                    
When running my app in Visual Studio, it's ending on unhandled exceptions rather than showing a message box with the exception info and continuing on as I'm accustomed to.

What options do I need to change to get it back to the behavior I'm used to?

Edit:  In Debug/Exceptions I do have the User-unhandled option selected for CLR Exceptions.

For visual studio 2015 :

1.Open Exception settings window (it's new in 2015)

Depending on the application, the following options may help you:

Tools &rarr; Options... &rarr; Debugging &rarr; General


Break when exceptions cross AppDomain or managed/native boundaries (Managed only)
Enable the exception assistant


Unwind the call stack on unhandled exceptions



[Note: Based on comments below, the following tip did not work and, for some, created the problem answer was intended to solve: use with caution...]


Uncheck Enable Just My Code &larr; JMC can prevent you from catching exceptions in code that's not yours and/or is missing symbols.

I was having the same issue in Visual Studio 2013 on a very large C# project. However if I created a new empty project and threw a test ApplicationException, everything would work as expected and the debugger would break and give me the exception assistant. Doing the same on my existing project would just stop debugging and return to VS editing mode. I noticed in the "Output" window, the last debug trace would show 


  The program '[2624] MyApplication.vshost.exe' has exited with code
  -1073741819 (0xc0000005) 'Access violation'.

Title: Update PyCharm on Linux
Description: 
    
    
                    
Could you please clarify to me correct way to update PyCharm on Linux? 

Is it impossible to update PyCharm internally? 

In help &gt; check for update I can just download a new archive.

Should I remove previous folder with PyCharm and unpack new or I should another way for this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In-Application Patch Upgrade

From the 2017 versions onward, it is now possible to perform a seamless upgrade without being required to download a tarball.  PyCharm will prompt you that an upgrade is available.

If you've installed under /opt, temporarily elevate privileges:

$ sudo chown -R yourusername:root /opt/pycharm_dir/


If selected, PyCharm will upgrade itself, and upon relaunching, should  prompt you to import your previous config, file, which is typically found here:

~/.PyCharm201X.X/config


Once you're done, re-apply root privileges

$ sudo chown -R root:root /opt/pycharm_dir/


If Upgrading Using tarball

I recently upgraded from version 2017.2 to 2017.5, and did so using a tarball which I'd previously downloaded.  It's also pretty simple:


Extract tarball in preferred location
Delete existing pycharm directory
Launch and import config


The only snag which I found was after the upgrade, my desktop launcher was broken.  If you do happen to face this, find the .desktop files, using a tool such locate:

$ sudo updatedb
$ locate *.desktop | grep -i pycharm


Output should be something like:

$ locate *.desktop | grep -i pycharm
/home/yourusername/.gnome/apps/jetbrains-pycharm.desktop
/home/yourusername/.local/share/applications/jetbrains-pycharm.desktop


Edit these lines the the affected .desktop files, if incorrect, to match your PyCharm path:

Icon=/opt/pycharm-201X.X.X/bin/pycharm.png
Exec="/opt/pycharm-201X.X.X/bin/pycharm.sh" %f

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
On Linux, you have to delete the old pyCharm directory and start using the new package. There's no other way, at least for now.

When launching the new version you will be asked if you want to import config files. You can find the old config files in a (hidden) directory in your home folder. For example: ~/.PyCharm2016.2/config
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Try to run following from your terminal after going into the pycharm downloaded folder 

    sudo ./pycharm.sh 


When you run the above it will ask about the update and also import setting from old version. 
Please refer to this link :

Answer 4: 

    
    
When PyCharm won't let you update due to missing privileges, you can temporarily add read and write privileges for other users to the PyCharm directory and its contents or change the owner of your PyCharm directory if every file already has read and write privileges for the file owner. 

Assuming you've installed PyCharm in /opt/pycharm-professional like this:

drwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 May 11 17:12 pycharm-professional


This would be a away to accomplish it:


Set the owner

$ sudo chown -R yourusername:root /opt/pycharm-professional
Start PyCharm

$ sh /opt/pycharm-professional/bin/pycharm.sh
Press Alt + H and Alt + C to check for updates and apply them.
Close PyCharm and don't forget to reset the ownership!

$ sudo chown -R root:root /opt/pycharm-professional

I'll be updating from PyCharm Community 4.0.6 installed at ~/Environment/ to PyCharm Community 4.5 on Fedora 21. Change directories, release names, and version numbers to match your situation.

Adapted from the PyCharm download page install instructions:



Update

Copy the pycharm-*.tar.gz to the current PyCharm installation location 
(make sure you have rw permissions for that directory, mine is in ~/Environment/):

[you@localhost Downloads]$ mv pycharm-community-4.5.tar.gz ~/Environment/
[you@localhost Downloads]$ cd ~/Environment/
[you@localhost Environment]$ ls
pycharm-community-4.0.6  pycharm-community-4.5.tar.gz


Remove the old PyCharm installation:

[you@localhost Environment]$ rm -rf pycharm-community-4.0.6/
[you@localhost Environment]$ ls
pycharm-community-4.5.tar.gz


Unpack the pycharm-*.tar.gz:

[you@localhost Environment]$ tar xfz pycharm-*.tar.gz 
[you@localhost Environment]$ ls
pycharm-community-4.5  pycharm-community-4.5.tar.gz


Remove the pycharm-*.tar.gz to save disk space (optional):

[you@localhost Environment]$ rm pycharm-*.tar.gz 
[you@localhost Environment]$ ls
pycharm-community-4.5


Run

PyCharm on Linux doesn't need special installation or running any installation script. You should now be able to run PyCharm:

[you@localhost Environment]$ sh pycharm-community-4.5/bin/pycharm.sh


Mine fired right up, opened my projects, files, and settings just like they were before.

Maintenance

Once you've started PyCharm, you can recreate your desktop entry with a couple clicks.

There is likely a ~/.PyCharm40/ or ~/.PyCharm30/ directory in your home directory.  I didn't need to change this.

I would have added this as a comment on the accepted answer, but [did not have 50 points when I wrote this answer].

Exporting and Importing settings is very well implemented in pycharm, and is detailed here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/exporting-and-importing-settings.html

So, just so this is a complete answer, the whole process to update pycharm and preserve settings was just:


unpack the new version (downloaded straight from their website) next
to the old version 
open old version 
go to File -/lili/lilicode/codecode/code/lilicode/code/lili/li/ulp/pp/p/div
Answer 9: 

    
    
You cannot do this internally because a new verison of PyCharm requires a new installation. So you will need to download the newest version from their site. Henceforth, as stated in the "Install-Linux-tar.txt" (included in the download): 


unpack the new version to a directory of your choosing (I used the archive mananger)
cd into the bin folder of the the unpacked files
run sudo ./pycharm.sh. You will be prompted to import your old settings or not.


PyCharm will take care of the rest. That's what they do! :)

I found this link very useful, so I will sum up what I did to update PyCharm. First, you have to remove the PyCharm version you already have:

sudo apt-get remove pycharm


Now, you can install PyCharm using two different methods.

METHOD 1: using umake

Open a terminal and run the following commands. In case you don't have umake:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-make


Now you can install either PyCharm Community Edition in Ubuntu or PyCharm Professional Edition:

# use pycharm instead of pycharm-professional for the Community Editionpycharm-professional
umake ide pycharm-professional 


If you want to remove PyCharm When it was installed using umake, you can run:

# use pycharm instead of pycharm-professional for the Community Edition
umake ide pycharm-professional


METHOD 2: using PPA

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mystic-mirage/pycharm
sudo apt-get update
# use pycharm-community for the community edition
sudo apt-get install pycharm


In case you want to remove PyCharm installed via PPA:

# use pycharm-community for the Community Edition 
sudo apt-get remove pycharm

I am currently unable to add comments, but just as a side note on Jonathan's answer you can update the desktop icon from within Pycharm itself. Go to the &quot;Welcome to Pycharm&quot; screen (File -&gt; Close Project, if you are currently in an opened project), bottom right configure. Under Configure, select &quot;Create Desktop&quot; entry. It should update the desktop path's accordingly.

    
    
Title: Setting up an Erlang development environment
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm interested in looking at Erlang and want to follow the path of least resistance in getting up and running.

At present, I'm planning on installing Erlang R12B-3 and Erlide (Eclipse plugin). This is largely a Google-result-based decision. Initially this will be on a Windows XP system, though I am likely to reproduce the environment on Ubuntu shortly after.

Is there a significantly better choice? Even if it is tied to one platform.

Please share your experiences.

Dynamic compilation with on-the-fly error highlighting
Integrated Erlang shell
And more....

I've only done a small bit of coding in Erlang but I found the most useful method was just to write the code in a text editor and have a terminal open ready to build my code as I need to (this was in Linux, but a similar idea would work in Windows, I'm sure).

I'm using Erlang in a few production systems personally as well at the office. For client side testing, documentation and development I use a MacBook Pro as the OS/platform and TextMate with the Erlang bundle as an editor.

For sever side development and deployment we use RHEL 4.x/5.x in production and for editing I use VIM. Personally, I've got 4 machines (slices on slicehost.com) running debian using Erlang for a few websites and jobs.

I try to go with the smallest 'engineering environment possible', usually the one with the fewest dependancies from apt or yum.

Just a quick note:
The Erlang "compiling" process described in Ciaran's post (described for Ubuntu 6.10 btw) can be easily skipped using apt command in any Debian based distro:


  apt-get install erlang  


Do not forget to install these packages if you see it fit:
erlang-doc-html - Erlang HTML document pages
erlang-examples - Some application examples
erlang-manpages - Erlang MAN pages
erlang-mode - editing mode for Emacs

I like Justin's suggestion, but I'll add to it: this solution is great for learning a language.  If you don't rely on something like code-completion, then it forces you to learn the language better.  (If you are working with something with a huge API, like Java or Cocoa, then you'll want the code completion, however!)

It's also language-agnostic, and in the case of an interpreted language, particularly one that has an interactive interpreter, you'll probably spend just as much time in the shell/interpreter typing in commands.  Even in a large-ish python project, I still work in an editor and 4 or 5 terminal windows.

So, the trick is more about getting an editor which works for you.  I'm not about to suggest one, as that's heading towards evangelism!

Since you're switching to Ubuntu eventually anyways, I highly recommend using erlang-mode for emacs (which comes bundled with the Erlang distribution). It is officially what all the core developers use and what many other developers use because of the many features it offers you.

Installing the Erlang distribution itself should be simple :)
    
    
Answer 12: 

    
    
Just wrote a guide on this on my blog, heres the abridged version:

Part 1: Download what needs to be downloaded.

Download and install the Erlang run-time.
Download and install TextPad.

Download a .syn file for Erlang and place it in the system folder of TextPad. For me, this folder was C:\Program Files\TextPad 5\system. I'm not quite sure who did this syn file (the site is in another language), but they did a good enough job.

Part 2: Set up syntax highlighting.

Open up TextPad. Ensure no files are opened. Go to the 'Configure' menu, and select 'Preferences'. In the preferences window, click 'Document Classes'. There should be a list of currently recognized languages. Click the 'New' button (it is right under the list of languages), and type 'Erlang'. Click apply.

Click the '+' button next to 'Document Classes'. This should expand the list, and Erlang should now be on it. Click Erlang. You should see a list of file extensions associated with Erlang, click 'New', and type '*.erl'.

Now click the '+' button next to 'Erlang' on the left. This should expand a list of several more menus. Click on 'Syntax'. Click the drop down menu and select erlang.syn. If erlang.syn is not there, then the .syn file was not properly placed.

Feel free to edit some other syntax options to customize TextPad to your liking.

Part 3: Compiling from TextPad.

Note: as of 12/05/08 there are severe problems with compiling in textpad.  The Erlang shell somehow ignores new compilation when it is done in text pad.  This is only useful for checking for errors, when you want to actually run the code, compile it in the Erlang Shell.

In the preferences menu again, click 'tools' on the left.

Click the 'Add' button and select 'Program...'. Navigate to the erl5.6.5\erts-5.6.5\bin\ folder and select erlc.exe. Select and single click the new entry in the list to rename it. Click 'Apply'.

Now click the '+' button next to Tools on the left. Select erlc, or whatever you have named the new tool (I named mine 'Compile Erlang'). The parameters field needs to read '$File', and the initial folder field should read '$FileDir'.

Ciaran's posts (this would be the first of his "series") about his erlang install is nice, as he details the steps in setting up the server (and other stuff like xmpp with jabberlang).
    
    
Title: Sublime Text 3 Deleting Code when I hit Tab Key
Description: 
    
    
                    
When I highlight a block of code in Sublime Text 3 and press the Tab key, it doesn't indent the whole block like it used to.  Instead, it deletes the highlighted code.

Anybody know how to fix this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is a simple Alt+tab (Cmd+tab) issue
I have found that this happens when I've missed the &quot;purchase this software&quot; dialogue and have not dismissed it.
Alt-tab (or Cmd-tab on Mac) to check if there is a dialog waiting for a response and dismiss it. This will resolve the issue.
As others have mentioned restarting Sublime will also resolve this issue because it is essentially dismissing the dialogue.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
For anyone else who comes here from google, read this first:

SublimeText 2 (works for 3 as well) suddenly started doing this to me today without changing any settings.  All I had to do was restart the program and it fixed itself.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
This is the default behavior for Sublime Text. If you select multiple lines it will indent but if you select single line (selection does not contain a \n), it will run insert_best_completion command and delete the selection.

The fix:

In your user .sublime-keymap add the following:

{ "keys": ["tab"], "command": "indent", "context":
    [
        { "key": "text", "operator": "regex_contains", "operand": "." }
    ]
},


This will make your tab key always indent. Not sure if it will conflict with auto-completion if you have it set up on Tab key.

Same goes for unindenting with shift+tab:

{ "keys": ["shift+tab"], "command": "unindent", "context":
    [
        { "key": "text", "operator": "regex_contains", "operand": "." }
    ]
},

Similar to the answer by Dom above, it also happens when the upgrade message for sublime appears and is not in focus. I've also found that if you open Sublime enable another monitor then the upgrade message appears off screen too.

The only fix seems to be restarting sublime. This also re-centers the dialog box.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
This was happening to me too, and it was due to the fact that my selected text appeared to be a block, but was actually a single line of wrapped text. By default ST3 will replace a single selected line with a tab character.

For me, it's more convenient to un/indent selections, whether they are multiple lines or not, so I added the following to my User-specific sublime-keymap file.

{ "keys": ["tab"], "command": "indent", "context":
  [
    { "key": "selection_empty", "operator": "equal", "operand": false, "match_all": true },
  ]
}

    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I figured out the issue when I click "tab" and check status bar in the bottom which should tell you why it happens. 

After I found the related package, I just


Removed Emmet Style Refloctor package which causes the issue (not Sublime Text itself)
Restarted the Sublime Text


It works well now.

For me - helped to move project folder to another path and open in visual studio as a new project. You can simply test that scenario by creating new visual studio solution and try to search there - if search will works, then folder movement could be a solution for you.

Just to note - i tried to open nodejs project, there are about more then 300k files and maybe it's the main reason, also maybe it was visual studio cache (tried to delete cache files - it was unhelpful).

Title: Choosing an IDE/Editor for Clojure coding
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm looking for an editor or an IDE for my Clojure coding and I found this thread:
Clojure editor/IDE recommendations on Mac OS X

However I have a couple of questions:
Which IDE offers the best Clojure environment (right now): IntelliJ, Eclipse or NetBeans?
What are the advantages of Aquamacs (I read Rick is using it) over the previous heavy-weight IDEs?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I have spent significant chunks of time (on a Mac) with:


Textmate w/ Clojure bundle
Netbeans Enclojure
Eclipse CCW
Emacs.app (not Aquamacs)


My opinions on those:

Textmate - was a great way to get started and is obviously a very functional text editing environment.  At some point I wanted better REPL integration.

NetBeans - not wanting to learn Emacs, I switched to NetBeans.  The NetBeans editor is ok.  I found the integration with build tooling for things like Maven was rocky.  The NetBeans remote repl is very very good.

Emacs - I eventually bit the bullet and learned Emacs.  Editing with paredit is truly god-like.  REPL integration is glorious as you'd expect.  clojure-test-mode is very handy.  But it's Emacs with all its pros and cons.  If you're going to use Emacs on the mac, I'd recommend using Emacs.app, not Aquamacs.  Aquamacs does not follow standard gnu emacs conventions and you'll find it harder to create a portable environment or use other people's extensions.  Right now, I use Emacs for day-to-day editing and my normal work environment.

Eclipse - The Eclipse editor is coming along and the structural editing has some of the niceties of paredit (but not the truly essential slurp, barf, splice capability).  The Eclipse repl is just a stock command-line repl and is pretty bad in comparison to NetBeans.  However, the NetBeans remote repl has been broken out into an independent project and is coming very soon to Eclipse which will make Eclipse even more attractive.  Maven integration is very good.  I use Eclipse now when I want to see lots of files and projects at once, which I have a hard time doing in Emacs.

At the moment, my bet is that the Eclipse tooling will start to pull away from the others.  But I'm still hoping for a Clojure-specific IDE to show up. :)    

UPDATE Mar 10, 2014:

The world has changed a lot since I first wrote this. There are now at least 6 very good Clojure environments.

If you have not allegiance to a pre-existing editor and want an easy place to start, there are two great choices:

1) Nightcode - everything you basically need to write and run Clojure in a new editor written in Clojure itself. Really easy to set up and just get going.

2) Light Table - LT is written in ClojureScript but I'd say has more ambitious goals to change the way we write code, making it more interactive and our data more visible. Very active plugin scene. 

If you are a Java programmer coming from the world of IDEs or feel like the support of a an IDE might be useful to you, then check out:

3) IntelliJ Cursive - this reboot of the IntelliJ Clojure environment is rapidly winning converts. Great set of tooling for Clojure and its getting even better rapidly.

4) Eclipse Counterclockwise - CCW has been in work for years and continues to file down the getting started and ease of use rough edges. If you're an Eclipse user already, you'll feel right at home.

If you are a keyboard hacker, both of these have excellent environments:

5) Emacs with CIDER - Emacs is more a way of life than an editor and for a long time was the only editor that could handle professional level needs for Clojure. If you don't already know Emacs, it is tough to learn both Emacs and Clojure at the same time. The "all in one" environments I've seen recommended most are Prelude and Emacs Live.

6) Vim with Fireplace - Vim has been through a couple phases but Fireplace is where it's at - lots of people are successful with it.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I have used both vim, emacs, and Intellij. Of the three I'm most productive in emacs.

Before writing Clojure I had been using vim for four years (and before that emacs for three) and considered myself among the best of the other developers I knew with regards to efficiency in vim. As a result I started out using it for Clojure. I found it to be painful. I was using vimclojure and only vimclojure. About a month after I switched to emacs I stumbled across this post. Had I read that before switching to emacs I could see myself enjoying that setup.

I've since switched to emacs and completely believe the learning curve is worth it but it isn't for everyone.

Developing in Clojure goes very well with Emacs if you add some packages. I could recommend you some of these repositories:

https://github.com/bendisposto/emacs.d

Or if you have a german keyboard layout on your Mac you can use my configuration:

https://github.com/n2o/emacs.d

Copy the repo into your ~/.emacs.d folder and start emacs. It will first download and initialize the plugins and then you have a ready-for-clojure-configuration for emacs.

To start the REPL, just use:

M-x cider-jack-in


Those configurations from the repositories are all from this gist: 

https://gist.github.com/rkneufeld/5126926

There you can see most of the keyboard shortcuts.

Sublime Text with Paredit and SublimeREPL is a quite a good option.

Answer 8: 

    
    
Agree with Alex. I have tried NetBeans,Emacs, Textmate and Eclipse on OSX. For now, Eclipse is a better choice. BTW, it also depends on your background. If you are a Java programmer Eclipse is a very good choice. Sometimes, I use the REPL - for example to try out Clojure 1.3 Alpha3.
We do need a Clojure-specific IDE; something like Komodo.

There is a new Clojure plugin for Intellij called Cursive.  

Unfortunately, it looks like La Clojure and Leiningen plugins are no longer supported and do not run well on Intellij 12 and 13.
    
    
Answer 10: 

    
    
According to book "Clojure for the Brave and True" the best editor for clojure is emacs. Make sure you can get emacs.app for mac. 

According to the writer:
"The reason I recommend Emacs is that it offers tight integration with a Clojure REPL, which allows you to instantly try out your code as you write. That kind of tight feedback loop will be useful while learning Clojure and, later, when writing real Clojure programs. Emacs is also great for working with any Lisp dialect; in fact, Emacs is written in a Lisp dialect called Emacs Lisp (elisp)."

Answer 11: 

    
    
Eclipse is best it's plugins are simply well integrated. I would recommend Nightcode on the side only because it was written in Clojure. I wouldn't touch Emacs with a fifty foot pole, I'm just not that hardcore.

VS Code does it for me on Linux platform. Looked at Light Table and pretty much similar to VS Code - built off the same engine, I believe. Go with an IDE that is closest with what you are already familiar with would be my take on this. If you are used to JetBrains IDE then Cursive - watch the License terms though.
    
    
Answer 13: 

    
    
I would also suggest looking at another IntelliJ Idea plugin "Clojure-Kit". It is younger than "Cursive Clojure" but might already provide all features you need. 

It is already in JetBrains's plugin repository. Or you may build it from sources (see https://github.com/gregsh/Clojure-Kit)

Title: Difference between intellij Project make and Maven Compile?
Description: 
    
    
                    
When working in maven module, what's the difference between doing in intellij build -&gt; Make Project and Maven Projects -&gt; Root pom -&gt; Compile phase.
Does intellij calls maven?
Does both of them compile the sources to the same place?
Do they both copy resources files?
Why do we need both options?
Does intellij download the dependencies automatically and we can just call project make, without using maven compile?

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
They are actually quite similar in terms of the task they perform which is to compile the source and test paths of the project with javax.tools.JavaCompiler by default. 

Does intellij call maven?

No it doesn't by default. Remember that this is just IntelliJ's built in Java compiler and some Java projects don't use maven.

Does both of them compile the sources to the same place?

Yes, they use the same source files to compile if that's what you are asking here.

Do they both copy resources files?

Yes they both copy the resource files to different locations though.

Why do we need both options?

We don't need both options. Maven compile command checks the source code against any syntactical errors which effectively covers the work done by IntelliJ's make option.

Does intellij download the dependencies automatically and we can just call project make, without using maven compile?

Intellij's compiler can be considered as syntax compiler which is why you need maven to handle your project's dependencies. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
No, IntelliJ doesn't call maven, but get all information from the pom.xml e.g. output directories libraries etc.

So don't worry, you can call make from IntelliJ for compiling and running your application.
If you have some special goals in your maven build file you can run it from the maven window.

All maven dependencies will be downloaded from IntelliJ an stored in the maven local repository.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Let's think we have a Project A which is use Maven Project B.

If you had changed B project you have to update this project on A. Then you have to compile B in A.

But if you had changed only A you dont have to compile Maven.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I've found LINQPad to be extremely useful when answering StackOverflow questions for C# or VB.NET. It allows me to write up some quick code, run it, and (if I want) see a nicely-formatted dump of the results. That way I can be sure that the code I post actually runs. Thus far I haven't seen anything that I can use to achieve the same result with Java. Is there anything like that out there?

I am not looking for something to query data sources; I just want a light-weight IDE. These are the features I'm particularly interested in:


The ability to write and run short snippets of code without establishing a whole project or file structure.
Reporting of compiler and runtime errors in the code when it is run.
The ability to add references to a particular editor instance.
Syntax highlighting and Autocomplete/Intellisense would be a plus.

Title: Xcode: Possible to auto-create stubs for methods required by Protocol interface?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Coming from an Eclipse / Java background, one of my favorite features is the ability to quickly stub out all the methods required by an interface.  In Eclipse, I can choose 'Override / implement' from the source menu to generate stub methods for any method of the Interface.

I'd like to do the same thing in Objective-C.  For instance, if I declare a class that implements the 'NSCoding' protocol, I'd like to have Xcode automatically generate the methods required to implement this Protocol.  It's frustrating to have to look-up and then copy/paste the signatures of the required methods every Protocol that I'm trying to implement.

I've been trying for awhile to find out if this is possible, but haven't found anything promising yet.  Is this possible in XCode?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Accessorizer will write the encode and decode methods for ivars passed to it (NSCoding protocol and for NSDocument archiving).  It will also generate string constants either static or #define with a custom prefix; copyWithZone:; and other things if you need - all from a simple shortcut via Services or from the toolbar.  Accessorizer keyed archiving

Not the direсt answer, just hint:

Out of the box XCode can't.

But AppCode can.

It can do this things automatically (with your permission, of course).

If some methods of protocol marked as @required - AppCode will highlight the implementation and suggest to implement this methods.



@optional methods also available to implement automatically (shortcut: control + I).

Your can create scripts for the scripting menu item in AppleScript, Perl, Python, Ruby, or any other scripting language that go in the scripting menu.

Xcode 3.2 will autocomplete known method implementations.

You need to specify a deployment path mapping in your server. Even if it's just the root path, you need to enter /. PhpStorm doesn't do it automatically. 

Go to your server in deployment settings, click the 'Mappings' tab and enter slash (or your mapping) in the 'Deployment path on server' field. You don't need to enter a web path. Deployment menu should be ungreyed now.

just did 

sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

or,

sudo apt-get install --reinstall openjdk-7-jdk if it is already installed and giving error,

and everything was fine.

On ubuntu I have tried all the methods that are described here but none worked.

What I did in the end was to:


download JDK from oracle and extract the archive
edit android-studio/bin/studio.sh and add at the top 

export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
save the file and cd android-studio/bin and launch Android Studio: ./studio.sh

On Fedora (and other RedHat derivatives, e.g. RHEL 7 and CentOS 7), it was the missing openjdk-devel package that was the issue for me. It's an easy fix and nothing to do with the JAVA_HOME path or the JRE.

sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64

    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
If you are using Windows, the installation can be confusing for many users...

The installer lets you specify an installation path, but this is only if you have the JRE option selected to install.

The actual JDK installs automatically to...

C:\Program Files\Java\jdkX.XX  on 64-bit

C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdkX.XX  on 32-bit

So you need to make sure you set the JAVA_HOME variable in environment variables set to this JDK path, not the JRE path that appears in the installer.

This answer may be very specific to a Windows 7 32 bit system:

BUT THIS TIME I TRIED "Windows x64  54 MB   jdk-8u51-windows-x64-demos.zip" which seems to be for 64 bit even though my system is 32 bit and the ANDROID STUDIO started working for me. My environment settings are following (under System variables and not under user variables):

JAVA_HOME-C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_51
JDK_HOME-C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_51

I had the same problem on Linux Mint 17.2 and it was very simple:

In the package manager I found that openjdk-7-jre was installed but not the JDK. All I had to do was to install openjdk-7-jdk.

As I'm new to Linux it took me some time to figure this out though because I assumed by the name of the path /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64 that it was already the JDK but it was just the JRE.

I'm running on Arch Linux, on an i7-5930k 6 core CPU and 64GB of DDR4 RAM, and I'm using IntelliJ IDEA 14.

IDEA was working just fine for me several days ago, but one day, suddenly, it began hanging after opening a project, during the "Indexing" stage. I did not update IDEA and nothing changed about my projects. The IDE's UI hangs after it opens the project, with just a tiny little sliver of the progress bar for "Indexing" complete. Every 5-10 minutes or so it unfreezes and the progress bar crawls forward a little bit, before the IDE freezes again for another few minutes. This happens repeatedly for anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour, until it is finally finished indexing, at which point it hangs for another 5-10 minutes doing nothing, before it finally unlocks and allows me to develop.

While this is happening, my system is fairly unresponsive - Firefox tabs take a long time to switch, and scrolling in them is laggy. Opening a new terminal window takes a long time. Switching windows in general takes awhile. In htop, one of my CPU cores is loaded at 100% while the rest have a normal load, and about 6GB of RAM is used (fairly normal load when this system is idle.)

Things I have tried that have not helped:


Delete caches folder
Delete entire ~/.IntelliJIDEA14 folder
Reinstall IntelliJ package
Download IntelliJ manually from JetBrains' site and run it from my Downloads folder (to see if there was something wrong with the Arch AUR package)
Configure IntelliJ to use my system JVM and Maven for importing instead of its embedded tools
Opening multiple different projects (not just the one I initially experienced the issue on.)


This issue is really hurting my workflow, if anybody has any solution to this I would be very greatful.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Try Invalidating the cache and restarting IntelliJ.

In the File menu, select Invalidate Caches / Restart... and then click the Invalidate and Restart button.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I've finally figured it out. The solution was... Rather odd. TL;DR: Run it under strace. Read on for a more detailed explanation.

I came upon it when I decided to run IntelliJ under strace to see what files it was opening to determine whether or not it was a filesystem bottleneck.

This gave me some very strange results: strace was spewing out a near-constant stream of segfaults. Not only that, but IntelliJ was running just fine, not taking forever to index.

After consulting with a friend, I learned that on Arch Linux, systemd logs a dump of a process's memory every time a segfault occurs, except when a debugger is attached. strace is considered a debugger. Arch was thrashing my disks when it kept logging memory dumps due to all the segfaults, hence why the indexing was taking so long, because it was fighting for disk I/O.

My solution for now is to simply run IntelliJ under strace. I will, however, be looking into the issue further, as I don't think java should be segfaulting that much.

edit Intellij[VERSION]/bin/idea.properties,
set idea.max.intellisense.filesize=50 

update:
Intellij will skip index files that size larger than 50kb.try this if you have many libraries or many large files(too many characters one line or too many lines)

I had this issue as well with version 2016.2 on Mac OS X. I had to do a force quit to end the application, then I deleted the .idea folder. The next time I launched IntelliJ everything worked fine, it had no problem indexing the project.

In my case I found out that Intellij is actually trying to index a 50GB directory with logs that was under the project's root. Make sure that if you have such a directory, it is marked as "Excluded" in the IDE.

You can see which file the IDE is indexing currently in the Indexing Status window (access by clicking on the indexing message in the toolbar). You may need to enlarge this window to see the full path of the file currently being indexed.

In PhpStorm, what solved this for me was excluding folders I didn't need to be indexed from the indexing (specifically the vendor folder, a caches folder, and a few asset folders that contained thousands of images). Instantly it began making progress and completed.

To do this:


in the project directory list, right click the folder you want to exclude
Mark Directory As
Excluded

I was stuck with a similar issue with the latest IntelliJ Idea 2019.3, so maybe it'll help. For me the issue was with one of the plugins, uninstalling/reinstalling, cleaning caches didn't help. My steps were:


Kill intellij, start it over
When it's starting and about to load a project, be quick and cancel opening the project. This way you'll end up with a small window with a list of previously opened projects and a few menu items.
Open menu /lili/li/olpstrong/strongstrong/strong/p/div

seems that there might be several reasons for getting into this "indexing" hell. I spent few hours trying to fix it using the ideas above.
At the end of the day, with some profiling work, I found that the bad guy in my case was the csv plugin: 
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10037-csv-plugin

I had few (not so large) CSV files serving as input, and although I marked them as not to be indexed, the plugin kept trying to index them. 
Once I removed the plugin everything worked fine.

I had the same problem with IntelliJ 2017.3.2. When I clicked on the indexing progress bar I noticed it was hung on a directory within my build directory. When I did a gradlew clean which removed that directory then the indexing was able to proceed.

I have encountered this problem, and resolved it:

delete all files and dirs which name regex 'jetbrain' and 'IntelliJ' in my computer(Mac mini)
then install idea


I also try just delete idea cache files, it do not work.

I had a similar problem with 2019.1.4. However, mine would change directories and sometimes, eventually, finish. If it did finish, it was somewhere in the 8-10 minute range.

I was all over SO, and even JetBrains' forums. I excluded directories via Project Structure | Modules. I used Invalidate Caches And Restart on multiple occasions. I tried having only 1 project open to let it finish. I installed and tried 2019.2.4 and 2019.3.3 (the latter would crash for other reasons). And best of all, it only seemed to happen on one project!

What ultimately led me to an answer was Help &gt; Activity Monitor... where I found  psi.impl.cache.impl.todo was running at nearly 100% CPU and not showing signs of stopping.

It turned out, I had a TODO filter setup with a poorly-defined RegEx. It was something like \b.*wip\b.*; the idea was to find all of our "WIP" values. Well, the leading .* was a huge mistake and one that didn't occur to me until losing many hours blaming a plugin upgrade. I believe the reason this was a bad filter was because the project it was hanging on is in ExtJS, which is JavaScript, which means things are in triplicate with the app.js file and whatnot...
