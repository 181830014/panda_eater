I am creating 2D games, where I have lots of background wallpaper for 1024x768 resolution. And I have dozens of icons to place.

I have tried Windows Builder pro + JFormDesigner but they are mostly suitable to create forms/data entry like applications/business logic, not especially 2D graphics with style.

For Java Game development which GUI builders are out there (free/nonfree).

Title: How to implement content assist / syntax highlighting?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'd like to create an IDE for a language and I'm wondering how to implement some features. In particular syntax highlighting and content assist are troubling as they must work even when editor content is not valid (when user is typing syntax hightlight should not disappear just because parser fails).

I am wondering how to approach this problem (and others as well). I've found this: How does code completion work? with a description of a solution to this problem, but it's rather brief.

I can come up with a way to implement all features I want at some point, but I'm not the first one and someone has done it already ;) (and reading source code of Eclipse is not that easy)

So, my real question is there a book discussing problems related with creating IDE? A detailed article discussing how to parse invalid code? Any source of information I should see?

Ah, and by IDE I don't mean a new application, just a set of plugins for eclipse.

Title: Vim: inline JavaScript syntax highlighting better than on a separate file
Description: 
    
    
                    
When editing JavaScript inside a script tag the syntax highlighting is much better than when editing myFile.js.

Is there a way to have the same syntax highlighting in a separate file as you have inside a script tag? 

I already tested both the stock javascript.vim syntax file and this alternative one:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1491!

edit: please check screen shot:


Left side is inside script tags and :setfiletype html.
Right side is plain javascript with :setfiletype javascript

I know it's been a couple of months, but I wonder if you've found a satisfactory answer yet?

I found the following via :help syntax within vim:


  JavaScript and Visual Basic embedded inside HTML documents are highlighted as
  'Special' with statements, comments, strings and so on colored as in standard
  programming languages.  Note that only JavaScript and Visual Basic are currently
  supported, no other scripting language has been added yet.


This seems to explain why everything that is does not have its own coloring in javascript.vim is colored "Special" when embedded within HTML. This seems to include variable names, function and method names, and so forth. I like it, too, because it separates variables, etc, from punctuation, etc. Much easier to see that your code is correct.

Title: How can I alter previous/next word navigation in Eclipse editor?
Description: 
    
    
                    
When navigating across words, the Eclipse editor considers a change in letter case and a hyphen-minus as word boundaries. This is problematic, as most of my variable names are of mixed case and, with some syntax (e.g. CSS), a hypen-minus can be part of a name.

How can I modify Eclipse to change its understanding of a word boundary to accomodate these common variants of syntax?

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm happy developing PHP with the lightweight editor TextWrangler.
The one feature it lacks and I would glad to use is a debugger.
I know the debugger is external to the IDE, AFAIK there are Xdebug and Zend debugger.
But you have to control the debugger and see the watches and all from an IDE like NetBeans or some Eclipse variation.  

Isn't there a lightweight app that just has what's necessary to debug like the step-in step-over, etc. controls, a watch, a stack trace, breakpoints, and that's it? So you know, you don't have to have this 500MB beast floating in your RAM.  

It could even be a command line tool, I don't mind, as long as it lets you debug.

Title: Utility or IDE Expert for Delphi 6 that can copy a component and its event handlers to a new Form or Frame?
Description: 
    
    
                    
A common occurrence with the VCL is building a component and then filling in its event handlers with code that resides in the host Frame or Form (if the component has Events).  The Delphi 6 IDE is capable of cutting and pasting a component from its host Frame or Form into a new Frame or Form quite handily.  But the code residing in the event handlers on the source Frame or Form is not copied along with it.

Has anybody seen a utility or perhaps an IDE expert for Delphi 6 that can also copy the event handler code too while duplicating the Event declarations in the destination PAS file and updating the destination DFM file properly too?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't know of any expert that would grab the EventHandlers code and duplicate it in another host context.
Keep in mind that a simple copy and paste of the code might not work as it would be in a different scope where the available properties and routines are not necessarily the same.
If you need to share handlers between hosts, I'd suggest you put the code in a common unit and call it from the hosts.
Or you can have a base Form or Frame and inherit from it...

Netbeans (x-platform) and Coda (on Mac) pretty popular if you're looking for an IDE w/ integrated revision control via git, svn, etc.  Git and SVN are both extremely easy to setup, but I'd recommend git as the learning curve is slighter and IMO overall a better revision control system.

Alternatively, you can let everybody use whatever ide they want, force them to learn svn / git from the command line, and focus on standardizing your code approaches (ie frameworks and libraries) instead of your development environment.

I'd go with the latter approach, since diff people will be using diff operating systems and have diff preferences.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I recommend running local installs of mamp (or similar) on each user machine. Then use 'git' for version control with a remote host such as codebasehq.com so that you can manage commits over your development team.

Title: Netbeans for remote system development - PHP
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have been using Eclipse for Remote System Development and after hearing a lot of good things about Netbeans for PHP development, I wanted to give it a shot. 

I ran into couple of issues even before starting:

1. Downloading complete remote directory to my local machine:

I work on multiple projects located on a development server and the code base is pretty huge. While setting up new PHP remote project using sftp to access my remote directories, Netbeans started downloading all the files from the remote location I specified. This is a bit annoying  as it is taking really long to download all the files (includes large videos which are part of the projects). 

Eclipse remote system development (and most other editors like EditPlus), on the other hand, simply shows me the remote file structure and only downloads a file to local temp dir when I open it. 

Is this behavior standard in Netbeans?

2. Will external file modifications cause sync issues?

I usually update my svn by connecting to the dev server using putty. Since Netbeans is trying to maintain a copy of it's own on my local computer, will updating the source files externally outside netbeans create sync issues?

3. Can I manage remote svn repos from within Netbeans?

Since I already checked-out my svn projects on the dev server, can I use svn from within netbeans to commit or update?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

Yes, it is standard. Netbeans downloads the remote application so that it can scan the local copies to enable code-completion.
It shouldn't. By default, Netbeans is almost immediately aware of any changes you make to project files outside of Netbeans.
Yes.

    
    
Title: Edit external JavaScript file after breakpoint is hit
Description: 
    
    
                    
In the VS2010 IDE when a breakpoint (or an error) is hit, it opens a read-only [dynamic] version of the external JavaScript file I referenced. My workflow would be vastly improved if I could immediately edit this file, and refresh the browser. That is as opposed to digging up the original JS file opening it, finding the correct line and editing there.

I only know that this is possible because I was able to do this on my old work computer configuration, but for the life of me I can't duplicate it at home.

Has anyone made this work? Perhaps an extension? or maybe it has to with the way the files are referenced, or my basehref tag, or url rewriting.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This happens when the base href specifies a domain other than localhost. My issue was that to enable a local environment for Facebook JS, I need my domain in the url. So I set up my host file to remap localhost.mydomain.com to localhost. 

When the Visual Studio IDE encounters a file reference which is something other than localhost, it does not attempt to grab the local file since it assumes (correctly in most cases) that it is being served from another site. In these cases it loads a file as [dynamic] and readonly.

Here is the test case:

&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;        
        &lt;base href="http://localhost.mydomain.com/virtual-directory/" /&gt;    
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="test.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


Any breakpoint within test.js will result in opening a readonly dynamic file.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
how are you referencing your files? whenever a script block is written inside the html or is dynamically inserted the debugger will open the instance of the page where the code stops. If you reference the script using  tags vs should open the original script file (at least that's what it does on my machine). could you upload an example of your current structure?

I am an eclipse user and android developer. 

I am trying to develop android applications using scala. I managed to do an hello world once in eclipse and now I am trying to do it with Intellij IDEA, so I can choose the best option. I managed to run simple scala examples in Intellij and I am trying now to create an android application there.

The problem is: Eclipse seems a lot more EASY to build an android application with scala than Intellij. For what I have seen you need to use SBT and install a lot of "extras" to get things done.

I have seen some questions here about IDEs for Scala. But didn't find a recent question about the combo Scala + Android.

So, my question is... Should I give Intellij a try or eclipse is just fine? Is it possible to run the application on my smartphone easly with Intellij?

I got this JVM.terminated.exit code -1 error while I am setting -Xmx2048m as maximum memory allocation. 

How can we set -Xmx2048m in eclipse.ini. My application throws out of memory error in -Xmx1024m configuration. So I should increase the memory size. I attached eclipse error log and eclipse.ini.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you are running under Windows 32 bits, the limit is around -Xmx1500m to -Xmx1800m as Windows 32 bit processes have an address space of slightly below 2GB, secondly -Xmx specifies the amount of heap memory available to Java, the java process however requires more memory (for the VM itself, and for the PermGen). As Java requires(/d?) a contiguous virtual memory area, the exact amount of memory it can claim also depends on what other processes have already loaded.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You did not paste the error log. The error is most likely because 2G memory is not available. You might want to try a smaller value.

Why is the Xmx java argument set so low in the default eclipse.ini file in the Mac OS X distribution of Eclipse? I often find Eclipse to be very sluggish prior to increasing the Xmx argument manually. By default, it was set to 384M.

One of the reasons:

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am looking for a ide for perl with code assist.
I tried EPIC and Padre but there is something missing...

EPIC has some minor code assist:

#!/use/bin/perl
#Example 1
use strict;
use warnings;
use CGI;

my $q = CGI-&gt;n; #it will show new as an option
print $q-&gt;h  #it won't show header as an option


Padre won't handle both situations but when I try to use for example '$q-/ppbr//ppa href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/DownloadUbuntu#InstallationfromCPAN" rel="nofollow"/a/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
In the source code of CGI.pm there is this comment:

###############################################################################
################# THESE FUNCTIONS ARE AUTOLOADED ON DEMAND ####################
###############################################################################


$AUTOLOADED_ROUTINES = '';      # get rid of -w warning
$AUTOLOADED_ROUTINES=&lt;&lt;'END_OF_AUTOLOAD';

'header' =&gt; &lt;&lt;'END_OF_FUNC',
sub header {
  #...
}
END_OF_FUNC
  # ...
)
END_OF_AUTOLOAD
;


So the header() method is created and added to the CGI object at runtime when it is first called. 

Seems to be a feature of dynamically typed languagues. I think this design of CGI.pm  happened to make it faster.

I recently realized I'm making it unnecessarily hard on myself to use 4 different IDEs, for every combination of (develop on Windows, develop on Linux)x(program runs on ARM, program runs on local x86 PC).
Currently, every time I switch between an ARM project and a x86 project (often a console app to pre-calculate lookup tables for the ARM project), I switch between IDEs.

If I already have YAGARTO installed on my Windows PC, what's the best way to set up (another?) Eclipse CDT to compile C++ code natively for my PC?


Is it better to somehow install 2 copies of Eclipse CDT, one set up to create ARM binaries, the other set up to create x86 binaries? How?
Is it better to install Eclipse CDT once, then somehow tell it to compile this project into an ARM binary, and that project into a x86 console app? How?
Is there some other IDE that understands that different projects run on different CPUs? What?


( Multiplatform C++ cross-compiler talks about building multiple cross-compilers. But I'm missing the next step: Once I have a few cross-compilers built, how do I hook an IDE up to them?)

You can switch toolchain configurations within Eclipse based on targets or projects. There's no need to switch IDEs, it's just a matter of associating toolchains correctly.

I haven't found anything similar posted anywhere else, but its not exactly an easy thing to search on.

Here are some facts:


Windows 7 Professional 64-bit SP 1
Delphi XE with and without Update 1 (Installing Update 1 was the first thing we tried to fix it)
Acer Prestige Laptop





The digits cycle to nine and start over at zero.
Typing into anything except the Delphi IDE editor results in the correct key value.
Holding Shift and a key gives the corresponding symbol for the shifted number. For example, if the next number would be 5, pressing Shift and a key gives you %.
Holding Alt and a key does the appropriate function.  ALT-F will open the File menu.
Holding Ctrl and a key does the appropriate function.  Ctrl-Z does Undo.
Most punctuation, such as  ,.&lt;&gt;/?, works normally.
Quitting Delphi sometimes corrects it for a while, but not always.
Restarting Windows does the same.
The problem starts without apparent reason. Sometimes immediately, other times after a few minutes or hours.
This happens with either the integrated keyboard or the external USB keyboard.
Starting Delphi without the keyboard makes no difference.
No software is installed for the external keyboard for accelerator keys.
We have not taken the painful step of reinstalling Delphi.
Turning off Code Insight made no difference.

The problem was caused by the Comcast provided Constant Guard Protection Suite, specifically the Guarded ID component. It was only intermittent for us, but others saw constant problems in game software such as WoW.

Closing the Guarded ID component in the notification area makes the issue go away.

Comcast recommends unistalling the component in Add/Remove Programs or it's equivalent, but some users have found that updating the suite may bring it back.

I am searching for a designer or  an IDE which can be used to create XForms by dragging and dropping elements.

I found visual XForms designer by IBM at http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/vxd .

There is Orbeon Form Builder. See also the FAQ. It's open source.

It's not strictly a general-purpose XForms editor, but it's a form editor that deals with XHTML+XForms+extensions. If you don't want to use Orbeon Forms to process the forms generated, you could transform the result e.g. with XSLT.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Is it possible to get a list of all public members of a type in the Visual Studio IDE?

When writing tests I often need to set all public fields/setters in a class/struct to some value.

The best thing would be if I could type:

MyType x = new MyType();


and then autogenerate something like  

x.StrProp = "StrProp";
x.IntProp = 0;
x.DtProp = DateTime.Now;
x.OtherProp = new Othertype()


But just getting a list and then use column editing would help a lot

What about starting a debug session, breaking at the beginning, and then calling something like

typeof(System.Windows.Forms.Control)
    .GetProperties(System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Public | 
        System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Instance)


in the immediate window? :)

The result is something like this:

{System.Reflection.PropertyInfo[0x0000004a]}
    [0x00000000]: {System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject AccessibilityObject}
    [0x00000001]: {System.String AccessibleDefaultActionDescription}
    [0x00000002]: {System.String AccessibleDescription}
    [0x00000003]: {System.String AccessibleName}
    [0x00000004]: {System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleRole AccessibleRole}
    [0x00000005]: {Boolean AllowDrop}


Unfortunately, you can't use lambda expressions in the immediate window - this would make it easy to get the properties in a format easier for you. But then, I'd suggest writing a really simple tool that loads your assembly, lets you select the type and just outputs the code in the desired format (and/or copies it into the clipboard or into the VS editor). This tool will at least do exactly what you need. Then configure the tool e.g. as an external tool in Visual Studio, to make it easier to run with the current project.

We've run into this with a fork in plugin development, with 2 different versions of the same plugin.  We can check out both versions at the same time (giving one of them a different name), but on each session startup eclipse will pick one of them as the one to use (in my case, causing compile errors half the time).

The workaround I use:


create a project, oldVersions
Check out the older version of the
project using Check Out As..., into
oldVersions instead of the default location
Now it is not on the classpath, and
so it won't interfere with Open Type
or compiling.


Then I use Open Resource as mentioned by @lschin any time I want the old version file.
    
    
Title: Default Vs Custom Shortcuts
Description: 
    
    
                    
In your IDE/editor of choice, do you use only the default shortcuts out of the box, or do you customize them? One answer per response, and why you do.

In my programming career, I have come full swing around on this. I started out in emacs/vim on a terminal window with a bare-bones install, no customizations, then over time swung fully into completely customizing them both, getting them just right, such to the point that other emacs/vim users could not even work at them (changing movement keys, etc). More recently, I have been working in Eclipse, the JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, and I have continued to make heavy modifications to each, so that they all pretty much behave the same way across all my machines. Obviously, this takes some effort to maintain, and every new IDE means a whole slew of command learning and changing, and then some (like Visual Studio) don't have certain commands out of the box, so they require plug-ins to achieve the same functionality (grow selection, delete words by camelCase, etc).

To be fair, I am an above-average speed typist, and I can work productively in any of these IDEs, but I have started to yearn for the simplicity of just going back to straight vim shortcuts, and using simple vim plugins to make it work in my IDEs. Then, at least, all I would need if I wanted to change anything would be a single custom .vimrc. 

Suggestions, ideas?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In my IDE, I use a slightly-customized version of the default keymap.  More of it is default than not.  I prefer using the default whenever possible: you learn it once, and then it's the same no matter where you need to use that same IDE (it's reasonably safe to assume that most installations have the default keymap, if they even let you change it at all)

My situation might be different than yours. In my previous positions, I used to code exclusively in vim. In my current position, I don't change IDE's often because I don't have to: 100% of my development is in one language, and I've been working at that position for several years now.  

That being said, I did just change IDE's (from Zend Studio to PhpStorm, by the way) recently, so the only changes I've made to PhpStorm's default keymap are to make it more like the several Zend Studio shortcuts I couldn't bear to part with. 

Otherwise, when I'm working with vim, I think in vim; when I'm working with PhpStorm, I think in PhpStorm. At this time, I don't think it's worth my time/effort to completely customize my keymap, any more than I already have. If you're working with multiple IDE's, your situation is probably quite different from mine.  

Ultimately, I don't think you're going to find a "right" answer to this question. Nobody else knows your preferences or situation better than you do. It's a trade-off either way, whether you go the default or the customized route.  Use your best judgment and decide which way you're going to go, and be happy with that choice. 

Best of luck in your development efforts!

Title: Eclipse: Edit any .class file belonging to the jars in a project&#39;s build path and auto-generate a new class file corresponding to these edits
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Eclipse, I can browse through the jars( that my project depends on) and open any class file from these jars. Once I open a class file, the source corresponding to this class file will be displayed. 

But, what I can't do is edit these  files and even better, be able to auto-generate the .class corresponding to the edits I have made.

For eg., lets take the log4j library. Lets say I add it to my Project's build path; once I do that the log4j jar file is visible in my Package Explorer and I would able to browse through the class files in this jar file and be able to read any class file within the jar file.  What I am trying to do is be able to edit any class file (say for eg., org.apache.log4j.Appender) and auto-generate a new class corresponding to the edits I have made on this class. 

Is there a plugin that would allow me to do this ?? 

It would be very helpful to have such a functionality especially when you are working with open-source libraries(log4j, gwt etc)  and are interested in quickly testing any new functionality you would like to contribute to these open-source communities.

thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
No.

You can view the source code because Maven downloads and attaches the source JARs for you.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
No. the source you are viewing is not from the class file, it's from separate source files included in the jar (less common) or it's from another jar that contains just the source (more common). To do what you want it would need to recompile the source to the class file, and then rebuild the jar file to contain that class. It would be effectively rebuilding the entire project.

If you want to edit an open source library project you should create a new project in your workspace for it, checking out the project from version control. Then have your other project depend on this instead of the jar release.

Why to use DRAKON than other diagramming systems?


No line intersections. You will never find in DRAKON diagram two or
more lines intersecting each other! Not seen in other diagramming
systems!
Silhouette structure. It allows to break one diagram in to several
logical parts. Not seen in other diagramming systems!
No slanting or curved lines. Only straight lines with right angles.
Icons are placed only on vertical lines.
Branching is done in a simple, visible and consistent way.
Each diagram has one entry and one exit.

But the rule might be when it reaches over 100 errors.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Perhaps it stops after the file that contains the 100th error.

This would mean that if the error count was 99 (say) and there were 3 errors in the file it would report all three giving 102. If there were 5 errors then it would report 104.

I have experience using Netbeans with Java but am new to using it with Javascript. I know how to open javascript files within a Java Project but is there a way to open javascript in a "javascript project" where I might be able to "compile" the code and see possible errors. Is this possible or am I asking too much?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
By compile, I'm assuming you mean simple validation (like using undefined variables or typos etc.)

I may be wrong, but netbeans has the worst javascript support. If you want simple validation of Javascript code, you may look at Eclipse javascript environment (or the Aptana plugin). IntelliJ IDEA has very decent validator as well.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
To check for code quality you can use some JavaScript analysis tools like JSLint.

http://www.jslint.com/

But it's not nearly as good as compilation in a fully typed language like Java.

An alternative is to not write the JavaScript at all but use Java instead and have it converted to JavaScript.  This gives you the advantage of writing fully typed code that can be statically analyzed and checked for errors.  Google's GWT does this and there are other similar options.

I like to carry software around with me on a USB flash drive.  I also like to work in both Windows and Linux.  Finally, I like to develop software using powerful tools.

Bringing these three things together, I want to be able to carry an IDE around with me.  My favorite choice is Eclipse.

So, I tried to get an Eclipse install working on a thumb drive.  Not surprisingly, it's just fine if I pack in a JDK.  But Eclipse without plugins just doesn't do it for me.  After installing my plugins of choice, I had a hefty 300ish MBs of data.

Then I realized that I'd only installed for Linux.  And that I was going to have to duplicate everything to get a Windows install.  That's not good.

I've searched the web.  I found a guide on creating .link files which looks like a hack from the early 80s.  I found documentation on the new Eclipse p2 provisioning which I couldn't even understand.  I checked Pulse, and they don't support Helios yet.

I remember in old Eclipse days you could just install a plugin to an alternate directory, and share that dir across different Eclipse installs.  Today, I couldn't manage to find anything of the sort.

I did manage to get Netbeans up and working properly in a cross-platform manner in around 30 minutes.  But I prefer Eclipse.

Could anyone give me a hand?  What I'm looking for is:


One install of the platform-independent portions of the Eclipse internals
One install of each plugin I desire
The ability to run this unified Eclipse from both Linux and Windows


I know I'll need a JVM for each platform.  I know I'll also need an SWT lib and launcher for each OS.  That's fine.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You need to have separate Eclipse installations for each platform and a shared plugins directory for both installations. There are many questions on the subject on StackOverflow. For example, see this comprehensive answer. 

Start with the standard Eclipse packages. Complete your shared dropins setup. Once you are up and running, you get probably move plugins from each standard installation to the shared dropins directory to save space (for example, JDT).

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am developing a Grails application along with a Grails plugin used by that application. In Intellij, I have defined two modules: one for the application, and one for the plugin. In my application's BuildConfig.groovy, I have defined the plugin dependency as a maven dependency, because when it is built/deployed to the production server, it should only refer to the latest 'released' version of the plugin. I override this dependency in my ~/.grails/settings.groovy file with my inline plugin location, so that I don't have to worry about accidentally committing my local development settings to the repository.

This works great when I use the built in grails commands to build/run/test, etc, but it has one fatal flaw: every time I do a clean, and periodically even when I don't, Intellij will read the application's BuildConfig.groovy file and remove the plugin module as a dependency for the grails app! This is extremely frustrating, as I have to then manually go to File -/pp/p/div

But NoSQL database are mainly Key-Value-Stores with a hashtable-lookup, so you can't really look efficient at the first n data sets.

Sure there's are exceptions like Redis and MongoDB which provide some form of sorted sets and indexes, but they are really the exception.
If you need such a tool write a minimalistic version like Try Redis
 or MongoDB Browser Shell, will not be much effort and provides everything you can do to query your database.

For MongoDB you can use RoboMongo, MonguVUE etc.  CouchDB has it's own interface but there are plenty of GUI's available but also depending on the type of NoSQL you will use as there are four categories.
    
    
Title: Has anyone else experienced keyboard errors with VS 2010?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Here's the situation: I'll be coding away in VS 2010, when all of a sudden the keyboard starts acting flaky. The up/down arrows will stop working, cut and paste keys will stop working, etc. The only way to fix it is to exit out of the IDE and then restart it (which is a pain). This will happen several times a day.

I know the problem is in VS 2010 because I can tab out to other applications and the keyboard will still be functioning normally.

I'm wondering if anyone else ever experiences this, or if it is a problem on my machine only. 

Extensions installed:

DevExpress Tools v 10.1.1
Enterprise Library v5 Configuration Editor
Telerik.CommonPackage
Telerik.Web.UI.VSPackage
Visual Studio 2010 Pro Power Tools
WCF REST Service Template 40(CS)

Yes - I've had the up/down arrow problem, and I know a number of others have had keyboard problems too. There's a number of issues on Connect for this but they are marked as Fixed. 

I hear just closing the document (rather than the whole IDE) can clear some problems.

I think something similar was happening to my coworker's machine after installing VS2010.

This blog post by Andre Loker describes the process in great detail. The relevant section appears to be this:


  The default build action of a file type can be configured in the registry. However, instead of hacking the registry manually, we use a much better approach: pkgdef files (a good article about pkgdef files). In essence, pkdef are configuration files similar to .reg files that define registry keys and values that are automatically merged into the correct location in the real registry. If the pkgfile is removed, the changes are automatically undone. Thus, you can safely modify the registry without the danger of breaking anything â€“ or at least, itâ€™s easy to undo the damage.


But here's an example of what you need to set:

[$RootKey$\Projects\{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}\FileExtensions\.spark]
"DefaultBuildAction"="Content"

I've been experimenting a quite strange problem using Delphi 2010. In one form (a quite complex one) some buttons are automagically losing the click event. I am not dynamically assigning the event or something (they are wired in IDE). The events are fired OK some times but suddenly (and randomly) some of them don't fire the events anymore. Placing a break point in the event doesn't stop the execution.

Weird, yes, and I'm lost. I know there is no explanation for this so I only want to ask if there is anybody else experimenting the same problem.

Check for multiple .dcu files in different directories. It may be picking up an older one.  I've found that if you're stepping through the debugger and the code seems mis-aligned to the execution (especially if it's stepping through lines that aren't actually instructions, like begin/end or comments), then you've got an old .DCU or .BPL.

I am developing a website with nav items that cover the whole stage from top to bottom (see altered image below) and it is pretty easy for the user to exit the stage with their mouse, not triggering the MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT events required to "turn off" said nav items.

Should I be using Event.MOUSE_LEAVE to detect when the mouse has left the stage, and turn off any enabled nav items? That is what I been trying to do, but have had trouble getting any output from my listener. Any ideas?

For a class associated with a movieclip in the Flash IDE, is this the correct syntax for registering an Event.MOUSE_LEAVE listener? It doesn't seem to do anything no matter what I do. Is it a case where I have to embed the movie in a browser for the event to fire?

this.stage.addEventListener(Event.MOUSE_LEAVE, mouseLeaveListener);

Answer 1: 

    
    
You're trying to create the event listener for MOUSE_LEAVE in the constructor. It's possible that the stage object does not exist yet if MainNav has not been added to the stage via an addChild() method. If MainNav is already on the stage at design time, it's still possible that stage would not be available immediately. For classes that inherit from the DisplayObject (MovieClip, Sprite, etc.), I do only one thing in the constructor: set up an Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE listener. That listener triggers an init() method when the object has been added to the stage's display stack via addChild() from a parent container, or if the object is already on the stage at design time. When my init() method is called, I know that the stage property will be available.

In your constructor, stage may not exist in the instance yet, but you should get a runtime error. However, you're using the 'this' keyword ahead of stage. When you use 'this' in a class that inherits from Object (your class does via MovieClip-

Title: which GUI based C++ IDE is commonly used for gnome applications
Description: 
    
    
                    
which GUI based C++ IDE is commonly used for developing gnome applications?

I am asking specifically for the gnome-system-monitor because I would like to fiddle around with it. And I would like to do it with a nice GUI based C++ IDE.

I thought that Anjuta is the default IDE for gnome applications. But when I fetch the sources there are no files which are obviously project files.

EDIT: Here is what I did so far

# get the build dependencies for the gnome-system-monitor
sudo aptitude  build-dep gnome-system-monitor

# get the sources for the gnome-system-monitor
mkdir example
cd example
apt-get source gnome-system-monitor

# build the gnome-system-monitor
cd  gnome-system-monitor-2.28.0
sh configure
make


But nothing inside gnome-system-monitor-2.28.0 looks like a "project file".
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Simply "create project from existing sources" in Anjuta. Anjuta's "project files" do not contain a lot of information, instead the Makefile.am and configure.ac files are used.

I have no idea what the gnome-system-monitor developers use, but I've read that a lot of Gnome developers use emacs, which apparently also doesn't require "project files".

I believe Glade is used, or at least was used at the time.

Answer 1: 

    
    

To indicate that you are done, hit ESC.
You can change the tab order by setting the TabIndex property on the controls themselves

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    

When you are finished, click the tab order again or press Esc.
You can set the tab order using the Tab Index property either in design mode or at runtime.

When you begin setting the tab order you klick the tab order button. When you are done you click it again to disable it.
You can set the tab order number in each controls properties sheet or at runtime via the TabIndex value.

    
    
Title: How to configure line wrapping for imports in eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
The eclipse and checkstyle guys of you will surely now this problem: After organizing imports in eclipse with CTRL-SHIFT-o, each import will be on a separate line, without line-wraps.

If you configured checkstyle to warn if you have lines greater than 80 characters, it will probably warn about your imports. Normally I insert newlines at appropriate positions in 
the statement and everything is okay. But the next time someone uses the organize imports function of eclipse every import is on one line again. 

The auto-linewrap of the eclipse formatter does not work with imports. 
So I wonder if there is another way of telling eclipse to linewrap huge import statements? 
Or is there a plugin to do this? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Why not defining an exception for the LineLength Checkstyle rule (with the ignorePattern property) ?
That way, any line beginning with import would not raise that warning.
