Title: Verbose AspectJ compiler output
Description: 
    
    
                    
I wonder if there any way to make compiler's output in IntelliJ IDEA more verbose. IDEA automatically sets up compiler to ajc from maven dependencies.



I assume that it can be not IntelliJ IDEA's problem. May be ajc needs additional arguments ?

Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This message is rather from IDEA itself, not from Ajc.

AspectJ support in IDEA is still work-in-progress so it's better to use latest IDEA version (10.5 at the moment).

Please make sure that compiler is properly set up (File | Settings | Compiler | Java Compiler). Use "Test" button there.

Check IDEA logs for any related messages or exceptions.

If still no progress please file an issue to JetBrains tracker.

Title: Aptana Studio : Code folds not being remembered
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have started using Aptana Studio 3 with a big JS document. It is quite importnt to me that code is folded to make the document more manageable. Unfortunately I keep finding that folded parts of the document become unfolded for some reason and that when I close and reopen a document the folds are no longer remembered.

Is there a way to make code folds more permanent in Aptana?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I've not found a way to make code folds persistent but would love to know though

In the meantime I've been using the "collapse all" option combined with bookmarks. 

When you open a file you can right click in the left margin and choose to collapse all (or CTRL+SHIFT+numpad divide) - If working on a code block you can attach a Bookmark also by right clicking in left margin, then from Bookmarks View when you double click the bookmark it expands just that code block and takes you to it

To open Bookmarks View in bottom pane: Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other &gt; General &gt; Bookmarks
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There may be two issues at work here:

1) Code will unfold if it's in an error state (i.e. the document is malformed). There was some work done to prevent this from happening all the time, but if there is a particular use case you run into often, I'd suggest filing a bug about it so that the developers can take a look.

2) Particular code folds are not saved across open/closes of editors. However, you may be interested to know that in version 3.0.2, initial folding of code blocks will be configurable, so you can set some items to auto-start as folded.
    
    
Title: Java IDE: Eclipse and NetBeans annoyances : any possible fixes or alternatives?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I like the Eclipse IDE, but it has an annoying bug that makes it too frustrating, where I will be typing a line of text, and after the carriage return or scrolling, the IDE draws the line incorrectly or overlaps itself, making it impossible for me to decipher it without scrolling back up to erase the line and let it refresh itself.

Both NetBeans and Eclipse have a problem where the context help will only appear after a '.' is entered after an identifier while I'm typing. After any incorrect letters have been entered or a symbol or space is typed, the context help will disappear and not return until I erase all the way back to the point and retype it.

Is there any way to fix these problems? They are very annoying to me. If not, are there any better IDEs available?

Title: What happened to the &ldquo;add as link&rdquo; option?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Why is the add an existing file as a link feature only available for managed projects?  I can't use the same feature in a vcproj.  Is it because managed projects are built for msbuild, and vcproj files are not?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The Add As Link feature is not necessary for VC++ projects (whether managed or not) because VC++ projects do not require all source files to reside strictly within the folder that contains the project.  C# projects, on the other hand, do have this requirement.  So you could say that VC++ always adds files as links and never copies them.

The price you pay for this flexibility is having to create virtual project folders that don't correspond to real folders on disk and manage them yourself.  This heritage comes from VC6 and believe me plenty of C# programmers envy that flexibility.  To show you the difference between the virtual project folders and the real project folders, toggle "Project -/p/div

Short of buying a SPARC processor, what emulators are there? Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Pickup a second hand Power Mac G5 and you can run a fairly recent version of a mainstream OS (ie. OS X 10.5.8) and a modern development environment (Xcode 3.1.4).
You get a pretty fast, modern RISC machine running an OS that is still highly used (for the time being, I admit.)
You could also install Linux onto it if that would be better for your needs.

Probably a lot easier to find and cheaper than a SPARC machine.

You could also install the SPIM emulator for MIPS
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
On revisiting this, it's worth noting that nearly all modern smartphones run on ARM processors, which is short for 'Acorn RISC Machine'. So, an easy answer is 'Android Studio' or anything else targeting phone applications.

Similarly, there's a plethora of simple development boards available inexpensively, such as the BeagleBone Black and the Raspberry Pi, that also carry ARM processors.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'd like to have a link which allows me to open a file in my favorite IDE. Textmate registeres it's own protocol txmt://open/?url=file://%file&amp;line=%line and it works fine, but I can't find out how to open the file in some other application (for example NetBeans).

It doesn't appear to be difficult to register a system-wide URL handler for a protocol you design.  In your handler you can send the file on to your IDE.  The handler can be Cocoa based or applescript.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using vim 7.0.

I want the following code be indented in the following way (initialization list in the same indentation as constructor):

  A::A() :
  a1(10),
  a2(10),
  a3(10)
  {
  }


According to vim help this can be done by setting:

set cino+=i0


But this setting yields (only a1 is indented correctly):

A::A() :
a1(10),
    a2(10),
    a3(10)

Title: How to encourage positive developer behavior with an IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
The goal of IDEs is increase productivity. They do a great job at that. Refactoring, navigation, inline documentation, auto completion help increase productivity immensely.

But: Every tool is a weapon. The very same IDE helps to produce chunk code. Some IDE features are an invitation to produce bad code: code generation, code formatting tools, refactoring tools.

IDE overuse tends to isolate developers from the necessary details. It is a good thing that you can start working but at some point in your career you have to be able to figure out how to start a process. You can ignore this detail for some time, in the end they are important to write a working product (vs. bolted together stuff that works 90% of the time).

How do you encourage positive behavior of other developers working with an IDE? This is a question as old as copy and paste.

To get the right impression: developers have to have the maximum freedom to mobilize their maximum creativity and motivation. They may use IDEs and all the related tools as they see fit. Nobody should impose draconian measures on them. I don't want to demotivate and force someone to do something. Good behavior has to be encouraged. It has to itch little a bit if you do the wrong thing. In the same line as the SO "accept rate" metric (and reputation). You can ignore it but life is better if you follow the rules.

(The solution should work in a given setting. You can ignore reviews, changing the staffing or more education as potential solutions.)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Train your IDE, instead of being trained by it.

Set up code formatting the way you (or your team) wants it. Heck, even disable it in cases where it makes sense. I've never seen an IDE align something like this with a sensible combination of tabs and spaces (where \t is obviously the tab character):

{
\tcout &lt;&lt; "Hello "
\t     &lt;&lt; (some + long + expression +
\t         to_produce_the_word(world))
\t     &lt;&lt; endl;
}


In languages like Java, you cannot avoid boilerplate. The best option you have is to check generated code, ensuring that it is the same as what you'd have written by hand. Modify it as necessary. Configure your IDE to generate the exact code that you need, if possible. Eclipse is pretty good at this.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Know what's going on under the hood.

Know that your IDE is actually invoking the compiler. Have some insight into the flags that it passes. Be able to invoke the compiler from the command line.

Know about the runtime system. Be aware of the flags that are used or needed to launch your program. Be able to launch the program from a command line.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I think before anyone uses  a RAD tool of any type they should be able to write the application from scratch (scratch being wiring together the framework components) in notepad potentially on a computer that is 10 years older than current technology :P. Not knowing the ins and outs of a paradigm/framework leads to bad code from novice developers who only learn things at a mile high view of the platforms they develop for. Perhaps they should do this in a few technologies -- i.e., GTK programming is completely different to MVC which is then also different to SWING and .NET.

I think the end result should be a developer that thinks of the finer details of a problem before they jump to thinking of how they will write an interface to it in a specific RAD environment.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
its an open ended question, but...

We have a Eclipse format file that everyone shares, so that we all format the code in the same manor. (Except the one lone InteliJ guy we have).

Everyone shares a dictionary file. It helps to remove all the red lines from the code. Making it look cleaner and more readable.

I run EMMA over the code to find out who isn't testing their code, and then moan at them.

The main problems we face is that most of the team don't know all the features/power of the IDE (eclipse). The didn't know about CTRL + O (twice), or auto code gen. All I can do as a 'hot key wizard' is keep sharing my knowledge with them to help them become more productive.

I look forward to the day when my problem is that they auto gen as much as possible.
Rather than me finding bugs where the wrong value is returned from a getter method due to a typo.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Attempt development (at least occasionally) using only a text editor and launching the compilation, testing, etc. from the command line.

Typing the commands will get tedious very quickly so create scripts or (even better) learn rake, ant, msbuild.

If the IDE does code generation for you and that code generation is really important (such as generating classes from xsd or proxy classes from wsdl), try to find out how to run the code generation from the command line - then hook the code generation into a build (so you'll never be tempted to edit the generated code).

The idea of autoformatting code is great but it usually just turns your code into a mess.  If you have less code, minor formatting inconsistencies are just not a big deal.

Adding code quality tools into your build - style checks, class and method sizes, complexity, code duplication, test coverage, etc (complexian, simian, flog, flay, ndepend, ncover, etc.) will discourage IDE generated code.

Description: 
    
    
                    
After reading The Pragmatic Programmer, I became quite accustomed to VIM. When in Visual Studio I have ViEmu (http://www.viemu.com/) to provide me with VIM functionality. 

Is anyone aware of a similar program/key binding/workaround to integrate VI/VIM key bindings in CodeGear Delphi 2007?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Delphi's key bindings are extensible, first of all there are several keyboard mappings to choose from out of the box and then there are APIs in ToolsAPI unit to write your own (you should implement IOTAKeyboardBinding interface). I don't know about VIM but I assume it can be done with these APIs.

https://github.com/petdr/vide is a very limited subset of the vi bindings that I wrote which integrates into the Delphi IDE.

It has a few quirks, but it does the job for me.

I have used it in XE2, XE8 and Berlin 10.1
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I remember seeing that in Delphi 7, but that might have been from CodeRush, a Delphi add-in that is no longer available for Delphi. . . . .

An alternative is you could use Delphi Prism in Visual Studio and keep using ViEmu . . . I know that doesn't work for your native code.

I have been developing a web application in a team of 5+ developers using ASP.NET 2.0 using Visual C# 2005 and Visual Web Developer 2005 for 6+ months. It was an internal application for our client and was targeted at Internet Explorer 6.0. I have been always using a non-administrator account on my machine and have never run into any problems. Specifically, I have not experienced any problems with debugging. Right now I am switching to a Visual Studio 2008 and I hope everything will work just as it does now. 

I am using a laptop for development. A the same time I am moving around and connecting to the internet in different places and I use my admin account only when necessary.

Seems silly to me.  Run VS as admin/power-user locally with whatever minimal rights you need on the network for publishing to the users and whatnot.

Answer 4: 

    
    
Use Vista, and take advantage or UAC, because that's UAC allows you to do. You can give VS full rights when needed, and the application/website limited rights.

I'm running VS2008 on Vista with UAC enabled. I've only had one issue worth mentioning.

I occasionally have weird file permission issues when I've run VS with elevated privileges then later run it without them. VS won't be able to delete the old build files, but if I delete them from Explorer its fine. Again, this only happens when switching between elevated and non-elevated permissions.

However, when doing the same in VS2019, it's like this:


The reason I would want the same behavior as 2015, is if I press enter key, or '.' key, it would automatically accept the preselected entry builder. On the otherhand, when on 2019, pressing enter/. would add a new line/. and the output would be bui + new line/. , as compared to 2015's behavior builder on enter, and builder. upon pressing '.'. Also, I tried toggling the setting under Options → Text Editor → C# → IntelliSense → Enter key behavior → 'Only add new line on enter after end of fully typed word' and it did not produce the output I wanted.

Scala IDE requires JDK 8, it doesn't work with JDK 9 yet: http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html (in the "Requirements" section, it states "JDK 8").

I can recommend using IntelliJ with the Scala plugin instead - even the community version is much better than any Eclipse-based IDE, including Scala IDE: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

That said, work is still ongoing on full JDK 9+ support in Scala: https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/139. This mainly pertains to building the Scala compiler itself, though; more than likely, you can compile your Scala code using JDK 11 without problems.

I've been using PyCharm IDE a lot recently when working with the TensorFlow Python repository. TensorFlow follows the PEP8 Python style guide, except for using 2 spaces for indents.

By default in PyCharm IDE I have the PEP8 inspection enabled to enable my codes follows PEP8 style convention. An undesirable side-effect is now I have warnings all over the place within PyCharm editor, flagging all indents (which are 2 spaces instead of 4 spaces).

If I disable PEP8 inspection, all warnings go away at the trade-off of no more PEP8 inspection (which is desirable).

Is there a way to enable full PEP8 inspection within PyCharm editor, but ignoring the 2-space indents?

Here is an example of the PEP8 warning (about indent spaces should be 4 not 2):



Here is a snapshot of PyCharm preferences page, under PEP8 inspection section (looks like it's either on/off - unless I'm missing something):

Two good options (for different purposes):


the suggested "duplicated question" link works well if you'd like to ignore warnings at a PyCharm-wide level. (done within the Preference)

Title: How to make in Intellij IDEA the generated method to be at the end of the class?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Intellij IDEA, inside a method, you can write something as:

myNewMethod(someParam);


Then if you go with the cursor on myNewMethod and then Alt+Enter (or Command+Enter on Mac) you can choose Create method 'myNewMethod' which will create the new method with the expected parameters and return type. 

The problem is that this new method is created immediately after the method which is in, and not at the end. I would like to generate it at the end of the class.

For example I have a public method and I generate the 3 methods in order:

public methodPublic() {
    myGenerated1();
    myGenerated2();
    myGenerated3();
}


it will end up generating them:

public methodPublic() {
    myGenerated1();
    myGenerated2();
    myGenerated3();
} 

private void myGenerated3() { ... }

private void myGenerated2() { ... }

private void myGenerated1() { ... }

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As far as I know still there is no option in Intellij Idea  to insert generated method to end of the file except getters and setters. But you can sort them in alphabetic order.

Go to File &gt; Setting &gt; Editor &gt; Code Style &gt; Java &gt; Arrangement Tab. Click on the small pencil icon which is placed next to item called method under Matching Rules section.
In there select order by name option from Order dropdown.

Title: Using Rstudio as an IDE for other programming languages (Stata)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I love the Rstudio IDE and the easy point click git(hub) integration. 

Can I use Rstudio as an IDE for other programming languages? 

In particular, besides R/Rstudio, I use Stata a lot. Stata is great, but the programing environment (do file editor) is years behind. According to this guide, Stata can be set up to run from other text editors (Emacs, etc). 

Could I set it up to run from Rstudio? 
Can Rstudio support syntax highlighting for Stata language?
If so can I add a shortcut or command in Rstudio to execute Stata code chunks? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I recommend looking at Sublime Text (3, which is still in beta, is the recommended version).  Sublime (aka ST) has tools and features that have made it a very popular choice for many programmers.  

To get Stata and ST to play well together, take the following additional steps:


Install package control for whatever operating system you're using.
From within package control, install your Stata package of choice.  I believe StataEditor is the preferred version for Windows and StataEnhanced for OS X.  These will provide you with syntax highlighting.
From within whatever package you choose to install, review the readme file to see how to use ST's cmd+b keyboard shortcut to send .do files directly to Stata for processing without having to switch applications out of ST and into Stata.


Just FYI, the Stata syntax highlighting packages were developed from the old TextMate Stata package.  This means that, if you can find the components, any modern text editor which can accept TextMate packages will give you syntax highlighting and, at a minimum, a more visually pleasant coding environment than the Stata editor.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You could always try using Stata as a knitr engine. MWE can be found here.

Syntax highlighting - most likely not. At least not out of the box.
    
    
Title: Netbeans and Eclipse doesn&#39;t show modal window and locks itself on MAC
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have downloaded Netbeans 8.1 on OSX and when I try to install Darcula theme it is not possible. I press install and the way IDE responds is like situation when user dialogue pops out which locks the application until user acts upon the dialogue. However this dialogue is not visible! The way I know it is there is because when I press ESC button, IDE is responsive back again.



The same happens when I go to preferences and click "Import" button. Application locks itself but I don't see any dialogue that I can do something about.

This happens also on Eclipse. As you can see in a picture below after I clicked "Add libraries", tab "Libraries" turned from blue to gray because some unvisible window has opened and rest of IDE is unresponsive until I press "ESC"(which usually closes the modal window).



EDIT:
I just found out that this happens when IDE is maximized. So I would like to know if I can fix it somehow that I don't have to un-maximize IDE everytime editor shows me some dialog.

Title: Can I limit the IDE to 2GB?
Description: 
    
    
                    
The Delphi Seattle IDE can use up to 4GB of memory, even though BDS.exe is a 32-bit program.
This is very nice for large projects but when compiling a small project sometimes the IDE goes haywire and starts consuming all available memory.  

When it was limited to 2GB this would sort itself out soon enough and I'd get a out of memory error;restart the IDE and everything is fine.

However when running Seattle on a PC with 4GB physical RAM the out of memory condition locks up the PC for 10 minutes or more because the disk starts trashing.   

Is there a way to switch the IDE back to 2GB on PC's with little RAM inside?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
We installed Delphi on a virtual machine. There you can easily limit the memory. The virtual machine also doesn't block the whole computer. The main advantage is that you can have access from any computer in the network.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There is no configuration switch for what you ask.  The IDE executable is marked as Large Address Aware in its PE header.  The only option would be to use a PE editing tool to remove that flag from the executable.

However changing the exe on disk triggers the copy-protection and shuts down the IDE.

Thank you.

I closed IntelliJ IDEA and deleted the file. Now files are reopened when a project is opened.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can go to File | Settings, select Appearance &amp; Behavior in the left panel, select System Settings in the left panel, and then select the "Reopen last project on startup" check box. If this option is selected, your last project should be opened after a restart, including the files that were open and the project tree.

Screenshot:

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Sometimes the file .idea/workspace.xml may become corrupted. As a consequence, the project stops remembering the open files. Please check this file. If it contains anything else than proper XML, deleting the file and reopening the project helps.
    
    
Title: Juno IDE for Julia, how to interact?
Description: 
    
    
                    
One way to comfortably use an IDE in an interactive language is to interact via the IDE in a command line environment. I am wondering if that is a possibility in Juno. In other words, is there a command line environment as in Matlab, to call functions, give initial values, and run expressions. If so what is the way to access it?

Note: There is a console window in Juno, but I can't find a way to insert my commands inside that.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Note: The question and this answer apply to the version of Juno that was based on LightTable. The current version is based on Atom and has an interactive console.



You can't enter commands into the console in Juno--that's for displaying output. Commands can be submitted from within the editor by setting your cursor in the line to submit and pressing Ctrl+Enter or Shift+Enter. The value will then be displayed in a small popup next to the line and the output will be printed to the console if you have the console visible.

Note that the inability to use the console as you desire is by design. See here for information about the console from the Juno docs.

I'm beginning my first Android app. I want to make a simple photo sharing app. Will I need to create a company before publishing my app to Google Play? Is it possible to create, manage, own, and deal with issues without creating a company? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Your company domain will stay the same after publishing it, because if you change it, it will be known as a new app and the users won't receive the update. Technically, you won't need to create a company but ideally a company name is there so that it will be used in conjunction with the package ID. Make it unique because even if you do create a new app, it's better to stick with one company ID than another one.
    
    
Title: Sort functions in source code alphabetically
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a PHP class with a bunch of methods. Currently they are in no particular order. I would (at least initially) like them to be in alphabetical order, so public function a() would come before public function b() and so on.

I'm sure I could write a script to do this but is there an existing program that can do it for me? All I can find is ways to sort individual lines.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You might find the documentation of Reflection useful, here's an example:

$reflector = new ReflectionClass('example');
$methods = $reflector-&gt;getMethods();
usort($methods, function($method1, $method2) {
    return strcasecmp($method1-&gt;getName(), $method2-&gt;getName());
});


However I would not recommend you to do that since it is better to order your methods according to what they do, for you or any other programmer that is likely to read your code.

What you want to do is work with an IDE that can change the view without modifying the source code. Many IDEs can do that including Netbeans and Eclipse.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Various IDEs can do this for you. Apparently Eclipse can, I know PHPStorm can and Netbeans can probably do it as well.

But I would not do this. It's not needed. A proper IDE should be able to display a list of methods in any order you like, and let you jump to them.

Moreover, if you want to rename a method, you would also have to move it. If you commit the changes to version control, it looks like the whole method was removed while another was inserted. This really messes up your history and makes it hard to review changes.

We had alphabetical order as a coding style guideline before, but dropped it (fortunately) for this very reason.
    
    
Title: How to write an eclipse plug-in to format C++14 source code?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In eclipse CDT, one can press Ctrl+Shift+F to format C++14 source code in current editor.

However, the default CDT formatter has a few annoying bugs. So I want to write a formatter of my own. I know it is not an easy work to write a non-trivial one, but I have a powerful tool: clang-format.

By using clang-format, it will be so easy like homework to write a C++14 source code formatter. However, the real obstacle is writing the eclipse plug-in. I just want to overload the default handler of Ctrl+Shift+F. 

How to achieve the goal?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'd like to share the Eclipse plugin named CppStyle. http://wangzw.github.io/CppStyle/

CppStyle integrates clang-format as another code formatter for Eclipse CDT and support to format the C/C++ code using Ctrl+Shift+F. In additional you can enable CDT to format the source file on save.

CppStyle also integrates cpplint.py to check the coding styles. Check and mark style issues on the CDT editor when the user is about to save the source file.

If you press Enter key when cursor is at the string's end Delphi IDE automatically aligns cursor position at the new line to the first word at the previous line.

How to change this behaviour? I want some amount of TAB characters from begin of new line to the cursor position, as notepad++ do that.

Under Environment Options &rarr; Editor:



There are some options you should check:


Use tab character. Inserts tab characters when you press TAB in the Code Editor. If not checked, pressing TAB inserts spaces. To view tab characters, select Show tab character.
Smart tab. Tabs to the first non-whitespace character in the preceding line.

    
    
Title: Why `as` operator might throw nasty EAccessViolation instead of normal EIntfCastError?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've made highly experimental and unstable IDE add-in, which causes extremely nasty A/V at IDE shutdown (breaks recent projects feature, grr!). I finally narrowed it down to the specific destructor:

destructor TMyAddIn.Destroy;
begin
  {$IFDEF DEBUG}
  { BUG is here, causes A/V at shutdown }
  (BorlandIDEServices as IOTAMessageServices).AddTitleMessage('Goodbye');
  {$ENDIF}

  { ... }
  { finalizing stuff }
  { ... }

   inherited;
end;


A/V exception happens on read of address 0x00000008.

I've added more defences to the problematic statement:

  if Assigned(BorlandIDEServices) then    { passes }
    if Supports(BorlandIDEServices, IOTAMessageServices) then   { fails }
     (BorlandIDEServices as IOTAMessageServices).AddTitleMessage('Goodbye');


... and figured out what (1) pointer is still not nil (2) QueryInterface still works (3) desired interface no longer present. Given that everything looks normal, I expect friendly EIntfCastError. But why I've got A/V instead?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
My guess would be that either


BorlandIDEServices itself is not nil but is also not valid anymore
BorlandIDEServices is valid, but its internal IOTAMessageServices implementation is not.


Those could account for a read of address 0x00000008 error.

What you should do instead is obtain the IOTAMessageServices interface earlier in your add-in's lifetime and hold on to it, that way it is still valid in your destructor due to reference counting, eg:

{$IFDEF DEBUG}
private
  MsgSvc: IOTAMessageServices;
{$ENDIF}

constructor TMyAddIn.Create;
begin
  inherited;

  { ... }
  { initializing stuff }
  { ... }

  {$IFDEF DEBUG}
  MsgSvc := BorlandIDEServices as IOTAMessageServices;
  MsgSvc.AddTitleMessage('Hello');
  {$ENDIF}
end;

destructor TMyAddIn.Destroy;
begin
  {$IFDEF DEBUG}
  MsgSvc.AddTitleMessage('Goodbye');
  {$ENDIF}

  { ... }
  { finalizing stuff }
  { ... }

   inherited;

Title: Give Intellij IDEA Visual Studio&#39;s F5, F10 and F11-key functionality
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Visual Studio, F5 is used both to start debugging and to resume program execution once debugging has started (or "continue").  Intellij has separate commands for debugging (Shift+F9) and resume program F9).  

Pressing F9 (resume program) when the debugger is not running brings up a context menu with a list of launch configurations, while pressing Shift+F9 (start debugging) when the debugger is running appears to start a new instance of the program and kill the old instance (!).  I can map F5 to both resume program and start debugging, but it behaves as if it was mapped to resume program alone.  Instead, I'd like F5 to resume program if the debugger is running, and start debugging otherwise. 

Is there any way to change the functionality of a key in Intellij based on whether the debugger is already running, so that I can make the F5 behave like in Visual Studio?

On a related note, is there some way to make F10 and F11 (Step Over/Step Into) start debugging at the first line if the debugger is not already running, also like in Visual Studio?  
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

  ... while pressing Shift+F9 (start debugging) when the debugger is running appears to start a new instance of the program and kill the old instance (!)


By default, typing Shift+F9 while a debug session is running will start a new instance in a new tab within the debug tool window. The old instance is still running in a separate tab. If you have the "Single Instance Only" option selected in the Run/Debug configuration, IDEA will prompt you if you wish to stop the current instance. However, if at some point you selected the "Do not show this dialog in the future" option, then it will default to stopping and rerunning.


  Is there any way to change the functionality of a key in Intellij based on whether the debugger is already running, so that I can make the F5 behave like in Visual Studio? 


Not directly. However, see next answer...


  On a related note, is there some way to make F10 and F11 (Step Over/Step Into) start debugging at the first line if the debugger is not already running, also like in Visual Studio? 


If say you map F5 to both "Debug (start)" and "Step Over" (or one of the other step actions) it will start the debugger when not running and perform the step action when not running. I'm not sure why this will not work for doubling up the start debug and resume actions; it most likely has to do with how the editor handles certain actions.

Title: How to add .c and .h files to Atmel Studio 6?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I know there are a lot of questions on this topic, and I've looked through a fair number of them. However I am still having problems. 

I started writing a test program for a prototype PCB, and now that it's grown to nearly 1000 lines I'm trying to break it up into libraries that I can use for particular functions.  

I thought this would be very simple. Make .c and .h files for each library that I need. I.e. I would have OLED.h and OLED.c for functions that control an OLED display. Copy the appropriate functions/definitions into each file. Then copy these files into the solution in Atmel Studio. I put them into the src folder under the project name. 

However, this doesn't work! I get an exceedingly long list of errors. All of the things that are defined in the .h file are apparently undefined as far as the compiler is concerned. I also get many error messages of the type "unknown type name int16_t/uint16_t/uint8_t/etc..." That part is really baffling to me. Why should it matter that functions are in an external library, now the compiler doesn't understand what those data types mean? 

So, this is probably a stupid problem to have. I don't want Atmel Studio to control my libraries by wrapping them up in some "library project" or somethig, I want to put them in a folder of my choosing and add them when I need them. I've searched for answers to this problem and I find long tutorials about changing the compiler settings for the project, the linker settings, etc... I tried this tutorial and still no dice: http://www.engblaze.com/tutorial-using-avr-studio-5-with-arduino-projects/#setup   

I also can't find a way to add something by right clicking the project and clicking "Add." It wants me to find .a files. The "Add Library" dialog box in Atmel Studio is awful, it seems. 

Surely it can't be that convoluted to just add a library to an existing project and have it function normally?! I've used PICs in the past and coming to Atmel I've found horrible documentation and a weird super-slick super-fly whizz bang interface that can't leave well enough alone and obfuscates simple function. What can I do to add these libraries?

UPDATE: Seemed to answer my own question. Turns out I needed to include all of the libraries to recognize data types and whatnot into the .c file. I somehow assumed this only had to be done in the main file but obviously I was mistaken. Adding asf.h seems to work well as it includes all of the MCU specific port definitions/names and all of that. All good for now!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Adding library files to a solution should be simple. Go to the Solution Explorer, right-click on your solution, and go to "Add-/p/div
Answer 2: 

    
    
You are right in saying that you need to include the necessary header files in the .c files where they are used.

The compiler compiles each C file separately, and then links them together at the end, so you got the error unknown typename int_* because the compiler had not seen the relevant header in the context of compiling that C file.

You also seem to be in some confusion as to the difference between definition and declaration.

A function is:


Declared in the header file. This means there is a function prototype, e.g. int some_func(char some_var); which tells the compiler that the function exists, but does not tell it what it is. This is necessary because the compiler only looks at one C file at a time, so needs to be told that other functions exist.
Defined in the C file.This is the actual function body, i.e. int some_func(char some_var) { do_stuff(some_var); }. After compilation of each individual C file in isolation, the linker is called to put all the pieces together and give you your final binary, which you flash to the device.


A function can be (and must be) defined only once, but may be declared many times - even in the same file, so long as the declarations are not conflicting.

Title: PHPUnit bootstrap in PhpStorm
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am working with Zend Framework 2 and I want to run tests for all of my modules in PhpStorm 5.0.4. I have PhpStorm set up to check for tests in myproject/module and it successfully finds my tests. The problem is that it doesn't read my configuration file within each module, which is needed (it points to a bootstrap file).

Here is the directory structure for a module (source):

/module
    /User
        /tests
            /UserTest
                /Model
                    /UserTest.php
            Bootstrap.php
            phpunit.xml.dist
            TestConfig.php.dist


When I run the test, it gives me an error because Bootstrap.php is not run prior to running UserTest.php. All of the files are correct, because if I cd to /myproject/module/User/tests/ and run phpunit within the Terminal, it works fine.

I would like it to use the configuration (and thereby bootstrap) within each module. I tried to use the --configuration option with a relative path, but I couldn't get it to work.

Here is my current configuration:



Any pointers on how I can run the configuration file (and bootstrap) when a module is being tested? That is, a module has its own configuration file and bootstrap.

Thanks in advance.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
PHP Storm 7 assumes that you will only need ONE default bootstrap file and thus does not enable individual bootsrap files DIRECTLY for each PHPUnit test configuration.

However, zf2 conducts tests on a per module basis. Thus, after you set the defaults to the first module the other modules don't work. The way around this is to 


Remove the default options in File|Settings|PHP|PHPUnit
You don't have to remove the default configuration file but you must EMPTY OUT and uncheck the  default bootstrap file. Just unchecking will not be enough
Go Run|Edit Configurations (there are other shortcuts to this box)
For each module you have to create a test configuration. For example, you'll have the standard Application Module and thus an "Application Module Test" for it, maybe an Admin Module and then an "Admin Module Test" for that
For each test (assuming standard zf2 directory structure)


a. Test Scope: Directory
b. Directory: C:\wamp\www\PROJECT-NAME\module\MODULE-NAME\test
c. Check "Use alternative configuration file:" 
d. Enter C:\wamp\www\PROJECT-NAME\module\MODULE-NAME\test\MODULE-NAMETest\phpunit.xml.dist
e. In "Test Runner options", enter "--bootstrap C:\wamp\www\PROJECT-NAME\module\MODULE-NAME\test\MODULE-NAMETest\Bootstrap.php"


Repeat for next module 


The issue here is that as long as the default bootsrap field has an entry, phpstorm will add that as default as a --bootstrap option AFTER whatever you put in the case specific Test Runner options. So, no matter what you do, you end up running the wrong bootstrap file everytime except for the first/default test case

Hope this helps
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Unless I missed something, you'll have to set up a test configuration for each module.  In your case, you have myproject.  Instead, you'll want one for each module, and then set up the configuration for each (Use alternative configuration file).
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I make use of the environment variables option in the run configuration to to define a value I can use within a global bootstrap.php to pull in requirements specific to a given module or section of the application.

class GlobalBootstrap
{

private static $applicationSections = [
    'section_a',
    'section_b',
    'section_c'
];

public static function init()
{
    $localMethod = self::fetchLocalMethod();
    if (!is_null($localMethod)) {
        self::$localMethod();
    } else {
       throw new Exception(
            __CLASS__
            . '::'
            . __FUNCTION__
            . 'Says: No local method has been defined for this test section'
        );
    }
}

private static function fetchLocalMethod()
{
    $section = getenv('APPLICATION_SECTION');
    if (is_null($section) || !in_array($section, self::$applicationSections)) {
        return null;
    }
    $section = preg_replace("/[^a-zA-Z]+/", "", $section);
    $method = 'bootstrap' . ucfirst(strtolower($section));

    return $method;
}

/**
 * Section specific methods
 */

protected static function bootstrapSectiona()
{
    require __DIR__ . '/../../{section_a}/module/Test/Bootstrap.php';
}
}

GlobalBootstrap::init();


Any arbitrary variable and value can be created and then referenced in your  bootstrap.php using: getevn(VARIABLE_NAME); This saves a lot of long-winded configuration in PHPStorm, but culd potentially get equally as complex if you're relying on a lot of differing bootstrap functionality.

selectWindow(windowID) has option to mention title of the webpage/window as a way to identify the target window.

syntax = selectWindow  title=My Special Window

note: title = title of webpage that is visisble in webpage's title bar. Or right click on webpage and select menu "Page source". In source doc, select the text between ....

So if the title of webpage = My Special Window, you will see My Special Window.

You could use the iterator to iterate amongst the windows, close the new window and come back to the originalWindow. And you can put this under the try block because it will only iterate if a new window opens. Or else, it will continue executing normally in the current window.

try{     
Set &lt;Strings&gt; ids = driver.getWindowHandles();
Iterator &lt;String&gt; it = ids.iterator();
String currentPage = it.next();
String newPage = it.next();
driver.switchTo().window(newPage);
driver.close(); //it will close the new window and automatically come back to the currentPage
}
finally
{
//continue with your script here
//this script will run regardless of the execution of the execution of the try block

Answer 1: 

    
    
Depending on how far you really want to go there are multiple options:


Dumb Autocompletion for text editors:
 There are editors like scite aka Notepad++, that take a simple textfile with all the keywords to give you autocompletion, but they don't take into account the syntax nor the context. All they do is to highlight the words they know (e.g. you have given to them) and to autocomplete just these terms.
Smarter Syntax Highlighting:
 This would require you to get used to the tools lex and yacc, if we are talking open source. I don't know which proprietary source tools are out there. If you want to get into that, there are several good pages on that topic, and this is one of them.
Compile it all the time:
 A simple but effective method for small projects would be just to compile it once every few seconds, and interpret the output. This would be the messy version, but might be fun to look into.

The documentation for adding a new editor to Eclipse looks fairly straightforward:

After switching from Sublime Text 2 to gedit, I've written a plugin that's much closer to Sublime's version of multiple cursors than imitation. I've tested the plugin on versions 3.4 and 3.12. You can find it here:

https://github.com/jessecrossen/Gedit-MultiCursor

I don't think it's 100% perfect yet, so I'd be really glad to hear of any edge cases people run across so I can continue to improve it. I've also implemented something like gedit's Command-R functionality with this plugin.

Those were pretty much the only two features I missed from Sublime, but then again I don't tend to use the deep features of any editor, so as to preserve my independence ;). The quick-open functionality is not as good as Sublime's "Goto Anything", but on the other hand you get usable integration with remote file systems mounted on FUSE, gvfs or similar, whereas Sublime tends to be slow because it's recursively indexing every file.

Title: How to automatically expand empty packages in Eclipse with hierarchical presentation?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have been often working on projects with huge namespaces on Eclipse.
Since I think that hierarchical package presention seems more visually helpful, I have the issue of selecting every package until the core classes, for example:

-br
-br.com
-br.com.company
-br.com.company.server.core
-br.com.company.server.core.web.common
-br.com.company.server.core.web.common.Utils.java (yay!) 


Is there a way to automatically and recursivelly expand empty packages when using hierarchical package presentation?

So, when I click 

+br


It would expand to:

-br
  -com
    -company
      -server
        -core
          -web
            -common
              +Utils.java

Use the "Project explorer" view and change the "Package Presentation" from "Flat" to "Hierarchical". You find this setting in the view's menu.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
For me, the hierarchical representation flattens multiple empty directories (e.g.: com.company.project) into one expandable and collapsible entry. The one trick I found that causes this to NOT be true (on OSX anyway) is that .DS_Store files will cause Eclipse to see the directory as "not empty". It then won't compress them into one entry. Removing these files (and any other hidden but present files in the directory) resolves this issue.

I can thus have com.company.project expandable with one click and all the packages appear hierarchically under it. It's a nice combination of the two views!
    
    
Title: CDI and Bean Validation in Java EE 5 Application Server?
Description: 
    
    
                    
CDI and Bean Validation are Java EE 6 Standard Specifications. Nevertheless, I can use both within Java EE 5 Application Servers (and also within Java SE) by just adding the libraries to the project. 

Is this correct?

Are there any disadvantages of using both in Java EE 5 application servers instead of Java EE 6 application servers?

I have to use the Oracle 11 g Suite and JDeveloper. In the meantime, JDeveloper supports JSF 2.0, but I cannot find any support for Bean Validation or CDI. Nevertheless, this is not a problem. There is no IDE support (for code-generation, a step-by-step-guide, or whatever), but I can use these libraries by using the simple java editor. Right?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Java EE 6 is basically a collection of APIs. An application server is Java EE 6 compliant if it implements all those specifications. But you can still use the APIs in an Java EE 5 compliant application server. Some people even put EJBs into Tomcat, so technically that's possible. Still it makes sense to use a compliant AS, as it also provides all the services related to the specs.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I believe that's correct.

The disadvantage is that you're a version behind.  You may have to modify your code if and when you decide to upgrade to Java EE 6 (e.g. new imports, etc.)
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You can pretty easily add Apache OpenWebBeans or JBoss Weld (choose one of the 2 CDI implementations) to your WEB-INF/lib and register the servlet listeners in your web.xml manually. Voila, then you have CDI support! 

For JSR-303 Bean Validation it's a bit more tricky, because only JPA2 and JSF2 makes use of it. So you would need to add Myfaces2 and Hibernate-3.5, EclipseLink2 or OpenJPA2 to your local jars and disable the container provided variants.

As it happens, I am working on a patch for exactly this bug.  See:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=332158

The fix would not allow you to install in this situation, but it would at least provide a better error message for you.

I got this message or something similar because I had installed Eclipse to my C: drive on Windows 7. Trying to do an update required escalation but Eclipse wasn't prompting me. When I restarted Eclipse using "Run as Administrator", it had the proper permissions to continue and it let me upgrade.

  Cannot satisfy dependency:
      From: Eclipse SDK 3.6.2.M20110210-1200


It needs a dependency that only exists in the update site for Helios 3.6.2 and you are running 3.6.1. You can either upgrade to the latest version of Helios (or better yet, Indigo) or add the update sites. I don't know the URL's off the top of my head, but you can try this method:

Download a fresh copy of Helios and install it to a separate folder. Open up help/ppa href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.6/" rel="nofollow"/a/p/div

Note that shared install have now (upcoming Eclipse 4.3, 2013) a way to:


Detect shared install changes:



  When Eclipse is running in a read-only folder (also known as shared install) and the read-only installation has changed (e.g. new plugins installed, new version of Eclipse installed), Eclipse will now detect this change and warn that your personal additional plugins have been uninstalled. 



Provide a Migration Wizard:



  Eclipse now includes a migration wizard to help users through the re-ininstallation of their plug-ins.
  This wizard is presented in two situations. 
  
  
  First, when a read-only installation of Eclipse is being changed (i.e. Eclipse is being updated or plugins are added / remove), 
  second when a new read-only installation of Eclipse is run for the first time.
  




See also "Shared installs just got better!" for more:


  Building on this support, we've also decided to assist users in re-importing their plug-ins from a previous read-only installation.
  The reason is simple, many corporations chose to deploy new versions of Eclipse in different folders. This is required to give teams the ability to adopt Eclipse at their own pace, but it also means that when users start using a new Eclipse install, they need to re-install the plug-ins they had installed on their own.
  Of course users could use the import/export feature provided by p2, but the time wasted by the user wondering why the plug-ins have vanished and then figuring out what to re-install can be significant, which is why in such situation we are also presenting the migration wizard.

    
    
Title: Is there a project to bring advanced language support to Emacs, VIM and other editors using the Eclipse codebase?
Description: 
    
    
                    
There are lots of questions here about IDEs vs. editors and which is better for modern software development. In the answers a usual point is that Eclipse has much better language support e.g. for Java and that other editors lag behind in this respect.

Which brings the qeustion: why play catch up at all? Eclipse will always have more development resources, so  it would make more sense to simply use the code Eclipse has. It could be separated from the Eclipse UI and it could be run in a separate process with which Emacs, Vim and other editors simply talk to when they need information, want to perform intelligent code completion or do some refactoring.

Is there an existing project which attempts to do this? It would be the best of the both worlds: one could use the editor to which one's accustomed to and at the same time the powerful language support provided by Eclipse would also be available.

As a vim lover I can't speak for emacs. Regarding vim, as far as I know, the only good project that combines eclipse and vim is eclim. But, considering my background ( I'm a ruby developer with a long Java experience) I would not recommend Vim for Java development. Eclipse is very good for Java and I don't like hybrid solutions. The real point is related to teams. It's very difficult to find Java developers that can use Vim in a working environment. So, when I had to choose the tools for a project, I chose Eclipse for Java. If your needs are personal maybe you could do different considerations and would go for eclim.
