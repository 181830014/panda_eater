Title: Is there an Editor or IDE capable of returning external program output?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've got around 14 IDE's installed for testing on my WinXP box right now, from Notepad++ to Netbeans, Aptana to Zend Studio. I'm trying to find one that will do what I need, but no luck finding a solution yet.

My goal is this:


  The IDE is open and I'm working on a
  PHP file. Click a button or hit a
  hotkey...
  
  My IDE sends the file I'm working on
  to an external app (Firefox, Lynx,
  Chrome, etc.) with any command-line
  parameters I specify, processes it,
  then returns the output (HTML source,
  in this case) back to my IDE in an
  output window and/or new file tab.


Seems like a simple request, right? ;)

For clarity, I'm not interested in downloading Win PHP binaries and simply running the script inside my IDE. I've got a virtual server setup (Virtualbox) which perfectly mirrors my live server and really want to use that for generating output and testing. Also, I'm trying to avoid switching back and forth between IDE and browser to check the source.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can try with External Tasks in any Eclipse-based IDE. Of course, it won't read your mind, so its up to you to configure the task:


http://help.eclipse.org/helios/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-exttools-running.htm


Also, Zend Studio has support for Virtual Machines, though Im not sure if it's relevant to your question.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The Zeus editor can run external applications via it's tool setup and capture the application output to a tool output window.

To add the name of the current file to the tool command line just use the $fn macro tag as a marker when setting up the tool command line.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Gvim, what else? Use a command like this:

:r ! [some command]


And the output from [some command] will be pasted into your current file. Or:

:20,25 ! rot13


Will take lines 20-25, run them through the external rot13 command and put the output in it's place.

Forget about JDBC when programming for Android.  Take a look at the notepad tutorial, for a decent introduction to using a database from an Android app.

For a good looking spinner, take a look at http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/

I recommend that you use the standard Eclipse tooling, as it works well (in my experience), and it has a lot of community support.
    
    
Title: How to set the @return value of a dynamic function?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Say I have this function:

function load_model($modelName)
{
   $model = new $modelName;
   return $model;
}


Using it, I can do:

$userModel = load_model('user');
$forumModel = load_model('forum');


etc. Both will be different models with different classes, different functions, etc.

However, my autocomplete doesn't work, because it doesn't know what the return value of the load_model() function is going to be.

Is there any way to do something like this?

/**
* @return $modelName
*/


That will tell the IDE that the returning value is a user model class, or a forum model class?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
No... the best you can hope for here is that if your various kinds of model classes all implement the same interface, or perhaps all extend from the same abstract parent class, you can put the interface or abstract class name as the return type.

Examples: 

If 

class UserModel implements ModelInterface {}

Then your load_model() function can

@return ModelInterface an object that implements a Model

...

Or, if 

class UserModel extends ModelAbstractParent {}

Then your load_model() function can

@return ModelAbstractParent a concrete Model object

...

There's just no other way for phpDocumentor to decipher a return type that is dynamic at runtime, and therefore there's no way for an IDE's autocomplete to figure it out either.

However, if your various concrete model classes do properly implement a top-level interface or extend from a common abstract parent class, then using the interface/abstract as the return type will allow for some level of autocomplete to work in the IDE.

EDIT:  there is one other way to document the return type, but I still don't think autocomplete will work by using it -- listing multiple return types:

@return UserModel|LoadModel|PlaneModel|TrainModel|AutomobileModel an object of one of the various model classes

Because of the diversity of platforms that Qt supports you may be hard pressed to find many plugins in binary form. The Qt developer network does maintain a list of QtCreator plugins here.

We're working mainly in Java, using both Eclipse and Intellij in the team.
We had a discussion in the team about committing IDE settings (.iml, .project) on our git.

I'm against this practice, but someone pointed me the fact that would be much easier for everyone to be aligned on the same settings like code style and warnings.

Also they showed me as modern browsers do a good job of separating local machine specific stuff from project specific ones.

Is there are reason why we shouldn't commit them?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The only reason why you could avoid version those files is if they contains developer-specific data (paths that are only valid for one developer and not others, some value which are only relevant on one workstation and not others).

Any other files that:


can be reused by any developer
help get back an environment able to re-build the program with identical settings


should be put in the VCS.
And that include any IDE setting files, as I mention in "Do you keep your project files under version control?", or "Which eclipse files belong under Version Control".

Title: Navigate to Event Handler Does not work in WPF Application
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am studying a code base developed using .NET WPF. I am using Visual Studio 2008 IDE. In the XAML code, I have a line as follows:

&lt;MenuItem Header="About"  Click="Main_Window_ContextMenu_About_Click"&gt; 


Clicking right mouse button, I see a option called "Navigate to Event Handler". However, clicking it does not take me to the Event Handler definition. In fact, this action seems to have no effect.

Why is this happening and how can I fix this issue?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you're using ReSharper, hit F12 while the cursor is on the event handler name (assuming you're using ReSharper's default shortcuts)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
That shortcut in the XAML designer isn't very reliable - it only works when the event handler method is defined in the code-behind for the XAML file. For example, if you have "Window.xaml" it will only work if the handler is in "Window.xaml.cs". 

This breaks, for example, if the event handler is defined in a second partial class file like "Window_EventHandlers.cs". This particular one even generates a new blank event handler in the code-behind file which promptly fails to compile on a duplicate method definition - yuck!

If you can't find it, your best bet is probably a solution or project-wide search for the method name.

Title: VS 2010 Floating code window NOT always on top
Description: 
    
    
                    
Most of the time when I code, either using Visual Studio or gVim, I like to have many open windows with code files so that I can go back and forth from one to another, either to edit or just read while editing another file. 

Thus I found VS 2010's feature of "floating" code windows very helpful. However, the fact that when a code window is floating, it's "always on top" is a bit annoying, because it might hide other windows, such as the "Find Results" for example.

Is this something that is customizable? Is there a configuration value somewhere that either enables or disables the "always on top feature" of floating code windows in Visual Studio 2010?

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Well, it is not a real top-most window, it is merely on top of the Visual Studio main window.  An 'owned' window.  From where it competes with other windows that VS displays for the Z-order, like the Find Results window.  You'd need to arrange these windows so they don't easily overlap and obscure each other.  That's supported, you can dock them.  Bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, isn't it?

Title: How to make sections of PHP code in eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've really only just discovered that you can use /** @blah */ comments to specify certain things, but is it possible to create sections in code?

Like:

/** Start Section "Blah" **/
$result = doSomething();
echo $result;
/** End Section "Blah" */

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
No PDT can't do that. Generally expandable code sections are identified by function and class method bodies. 

If you think you need artificial sections identified by comments I recommend to rather think about reorganizing your code into more fine grained files, function, classes and methods that can be easily documented using PhpDoc (which is the standard PDT uses).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
these sections

 /**
   * here goes your text
   * @author Nanne
   * /


Are based on javadoc: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html

Look at this page where a documenter for PHP is described. I don't know what standard is used in Eclipse, but I'm guessing they're all rather alike:
http://www.phpdoc.org/

Is is mostly based on commenting certain parts of code, e.g. classes, functions and variables. As far as I know there is no special code for "sections". The reason I think this, is that you are 'supposed' to make a documentation from this, with classes, it's methods etc. There is no special way to represent "sections" in a documentation like that.

But do read above links, it'll clear up a lot!
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
In PHP you can use sections to separate pieces of code. Syntax is like this:

Blah:{
   $result = doSomething();
   echo $result;
}


These were used by goto style procedural programming before object oriented programming was used (classes and instances). Using these sections and goto statements is very bad practice and should be shunned by any developer.

Title: JavaScript inheritance with working code assistant and outlines?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I know a plenty of different approaches to JavaScript inheritance. I think one of the most important factors is whether code assistant and outline still works with the inheritance model.

For example, in ExtJS inheritance involves:

MyApp.SuperWindow = Ext.extend(Ext.Window, {
    constructor: function() {
        this.doSomething();
        MyApp.SuperWindow.superclass.constructor.apply(this, arguments);
    },

    doSomething: function() {
    }
});


Our SuperWindow extends Ext's Window component with additional functionality of doing something. While this inheritance works, you lose code assistant and the outline in all IDEs I know (Eclipse, Netbeans, Aptana, NuSphere among others).

You could, however, do something like:

MyApp.SuperWindow = {
    constructor: function() {
        this.doSomething();
        MyApp.SuperWindow.superclass.constructor.apply(this, arguments);
    },

    doSomething: function() {
    }
});

MyApp.SuperWindow = Ext.extend(Ext.Window, MyApp.SuperWindow);


But that just looks horrible. You need to type MyApp.SuperWindow thrice (not including the parent constructor call that you could write with this).

How would you go about inheritance in JavaScript while maintaining code assistants and outlines?

I would like to retain the concept of a parent/super with the inheritance model. Since the typical inheritance involves placing a copy of an object into one's prototype only, you get no such things as supers.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I'm quite a fan of John Resig's Simple Javascript Inheritance, which is quite clean in syntax, e.g.:

var Person = Class.extend({
  init: function(forename, surname)
  {
    this.Forename = forename;
    this.Surname = surname;
  }
});

var Employee = Person.extend({
  init: function(forename, surname, role)
  {
    this._super(forename, surname);
    this.Role = role;
  }
});

var employee = new Employee("Matthew", "Abbott", "Developer");
console.log(employee.Forename + " " + employee.Surname + " is a " + employee.Role);

console.log(employee instanceof Class);
console.log(employee instanceof Person);
console.log(employee instanceof Employee);

The answer was to ensure that all references were .NET references. I had a COM one hiding in there. I removed the VB related references, reloaded the project, added the references (all .NET this time) and it all came to life.
    
    
Title: Platform-independent C++ Debugger IDEs that follow pointers like Visual Studio
Description: 
    
    
                    
Visual Studio debugger automatically recognizes the types of pointers and shows the value of the variable or object pointed to by the pointer.  Example screenshot for Ruby debugger here:  http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/jruby-debugger.jpg   This applies to debugger tooltips, watch windows, etc.  I never have to see the value of a pointer.  Same thing happens for arrays.

Are there platform-independent (preferably free/open source) debugger IDEs that allow this for C++?  I tried Code::Blocks, Geany, Eclipse, etc., they all just show the value of the pointer (looking like 0xE0CCDB34).  There could possibly be settings in these IDEs but I could not find it.

My main interest is to be able to compile and debug C++ with GCC/MinGW toolchains.  So if no platform-independent IDE debuggers support this, are there any free ones on Windows that use GCC/MinGW toolchain?

The c++ interpreter/compiler/REPL in ROOT is called cint, and has the ability to insert breakpoints (-b on the command-line or .b in the interpreter), at which time you can print the values of variables; access members; invoke functions and methods; manipulate memory; and so on very much like a traditional debugger. 

And ROOT runs on many platforms.

Cint is separable from ROOT and can be used in other contexts, but I have no experience with doing that.

I'd like to set up Android SDK with Netbeans or Visual Studio 2010. I am coming back to Windows programming after 3 months on Apple iMac (for iPhone programming). 

Would somebody be able to explain how to set up the NetBeans environment so I can compile and test Android Apps directly form NetBeans.

I will be testing on a simulator, not a real device. My platform is Windows 7 Ultimate.

Thanks.

EDIT: 

nbandroid is proving annoying to set up. It requires platforms. How do I install those?
It seems I can't use Eclipse even if I wanted to. It can't find the Java VM DLL... Help with that is appreciated.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You need to install the Android SDK and a NetBeans plugin called nbandroid. There are lots of instructions here.

I do recommend however using Eclipse because the plugin that you use on that is officially supported by Google, the Netbeans one is community developed I think, and a lot of the tools may be missing (like Allocation Tracker or Emulator controls. I don't know if they are in the netbeans plugin because I haven't used it but I'm guessing you wont have the full range of SDK tools available in the plugin).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Doesn't sound like nbAndroid is your problem.  No matter how you develop you need to select the Android target platforms with the AVD Manager from the Android SDK.

Description: 
    
    
                    
So, I popped open up Flash CS5 just now, and I couldn't find my projects panel. 
I was working on a dual screen set up previously, so my windows were everywhere anyways (sans external).

I switched over to a smaller screen workspace, and popped opened the projects panel. Oddly enough, the code snippets panel came up instead.

So, I switched off the code snippets, and tried again.

I've been trying different ways of opening this panel for about 15 minutes, and I'm totally stumped. Some thorough googling didn't present any relevant results, so, StackOverflow, I turn to you. Is this a known issue? is there a secret backdoor way to open this panel? Am I totally missing something?

So, just in case someone runs into this, and mostly because this is ruining my accept rate, I never figured out what the issue was that was causing this.

As Allan suggested, windows/workspace/reset didn't do the trick, but who knows, maybe it'll work for someone else?

Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The command-line tool xcode-select is what you want:

Usage: xcode-select -print-path
   or: xcode-select -switch &lt;xcode_folder_path&gt;
   or: xcode-select -version
Arguments:
   -print-path                     Prints the path of the current Xcode folder
   -switch &lt;xcode_folder_path&gt;     Sets the path for the current Xcode folder
   -version                        Prints xcode-select version information


You will have to use sudo to actually change it with -switch.

Description: 
    
    
                    
In the Delphi 2009 RAD Studio, there is a drop-down combo box where you can select the desktop configuration, i.e. "Default Layout", "Debug Layout, "Classic Undocked", etc. This has stopped working for me, i.e. when I select a desktop, nothing happens. I think I once "customized" the toolbar, by removing the drop-down combo box, and then I added it again, and ever since it has been dead. Is this a known bug? Is there a cure?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Create a new user account on your computer, call it "Testing" and log in there. Now load up delphi and try this desktop layout button. If it's now working in this alternative desktop account, then it's something in your registry settings under this key:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CodeGear\BDS\6.0


Try setting the keys named DesktopName and RuntimeDesktopName under the Session key

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CodeGear\BDS\6.0\Session\DesktopName=Default Layout
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CodeGear\BDS\6.0\Session\RuntimeDesktopName=Debug Layout

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Is it still switching configurations when you run the project or when you go back to coding?
Have you tried to create new custom configurations, save them and switch manually with the combo?  

My guess is it's something wrong saved in the Registry. You could try (after saving your current registry) to get a (good) D2009 registry from another install where it works, and apply it to your machine. If it works again you'll have a way to figure it out by diffing the regs. If not you may have to reinstall D2009 (or at least try"repair").

Open Debug/makefile or Release/makefile in the text editor. It contains commands that you see in the Console window. Additionaly, clean section is executed when you make Clean and not regular build. 

Generally, CDT generates makefile according to the project properties, for all source files in the projects. Then it executes makefile using command make, with optional parameters. You can do the same by executing make command from the command line in Debug or Release directories.

From the command line, it looks like this:


alex@alex-linux:~/workspace/Test/Debug$ make clean
rm -rf  ./main.o  ./main.d  Test

Description: 
    
    
                    
It's growing pains time again. Some of our stuff requires FlashBuilder 4 and some still requires FlexBuilder 3. Both are installed OK, and no projects use both IDEs. The trouble is, when I go back to work on a FlexBuilder 3 project it takes freakin' forever to build and I get weird errors like these:




This doesn't seem to cause any identifiable problems except to throw up a modal dialog at various points in the build process, forcing user interaction. But I do notice that memory fills up fast in FB3 and generally FB3 starts behaving strangely and ultimately quits once it gets up over 700MB. 

This is only a temporary bridge situation until we get all projects into FB4, but "temporary" could mean weeks if not months. Does anyone have any advice for how to get through this bridge period? Is there anything I can do to make these two IDEs work and play well together? Failing that, does anyone know what "java.lang.String" is the "reason" for the problem? Does Eclipse have a resource bundle somewhere that is getting corrupted when i go back and forth between the two?

I'm not talking about a continuous build process, but the excellent feature in Eclipse whereby any java code changes are automatically built in a background thread. With this enabled, running unit tests or applications is immediate. Going back to the 'manual' builds of VS20XX is quite painful.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Actually, in Visual Studio - one of the best features in Visual Basic that is not in C# is that Visual Basic is compiled in the background as you work.  Though, I'm not sure if it speeds up your unit tests, etc.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm working in Java and implementing a basic tree (yes, for homework, but hear me out!).  I discovered that I made an error and had an iterator class inherit from an iterator superclass, where both needed an internal reference to the same node in the tree.  Now every time I reference the node in the subclass and make a change, I have to make the same change in the superclass, or they will be out of sync.

I don't have many classes in the package and I could do it by hand; however, I wondered if Eclipse has the ability to remove references when a class is deleted from a package.  I've done something similar before and I don't think it does automatically, so perhaps the answer is simply no; however, it would be nice.  Hoping that some SO wisdom can help here.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I don't see how it could remove references automatically, to be honest - if you're using a variable of that type, it would have to remove all the code using that variable, which is clearly going to affect how things work.

You can just delete the class and fix up the compiler errors though :)

I'm getting a bit more seasoned with my iPhone development but I still don't know everything. One thing that bugs the hell out of me is having to add properties to a class, because there are four steps involved:


Add a class member to the Header file
Add the property definition to the Header file
Add a synthesize declaration to the implementation file
Add a release statement to the dealloc method in the implementation file


Is there any easier way to do it? A hidden feature of XCode I don't know about? A tool of some  kind maybe?

Accessorizer might be what you're looking for. I've never used it personally but many Mac Developer podcasts give it rave reviews.
    
    
Title: How can I make MPLAB import a HEX file with comments or import a HEX file specified on a commandline?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm working with the CCS c compiler which produces its object files in the Intel 32 bit HEX format, aka INHX32.  This compiler has a directive which causes it to put comments in these files. The comment lines are at the beginning of the file, and begin with a semicolon, like so:

;  This is a comment
:020000040000FA
:1000000007EF33F0000C000C056ED8CF06F0E0CF00
:1000100007F00001E9CF0DF0EACF08F0E1CF09F0D9


I'd like to use this directive, as the comments would be extremely useful to those who later import the hex files into MPLAB. However, MPLAB will not import files with comments. When I try, I get an "Invalid file format, information not available" error.

I realize these comment lines are not part of the original Intel spec, but some other compilers and development tools accept them.  Is there any way to make MPLAB do so?  

I could write a script that would strip these lines out and then pass the resulting file to MPLAB, but as far as I can tell MPLAB can't import a file via the commandline.

Some versions of MPLAB accept comments and the end of the file.
In CCS, The #HEXCOMMENT\ (with a back slash) puts the comment at the end of the hex file.

Random stuff...


Is there a compiler flag that disables this comment in the object?  That would be the best place to start.
If not that, does the IDE's C plug-in let you add a post-processor in it?  If it's as above, you could write a comment eater easily.

It turns out MPLAB definitely doesn't do imports (or much else) from the commandline.  So I wrote an AutoIt script to strip the comments, and save the rest in a temporary file. Then it imports that file into MPLAB by controlling MPLAB's GUI.  

This is actually better than getting MPLAB to import the file directly, since my script displays the comments in a dialog so there is no need for the user to open the file in an editor to read them. 
    
    
Title: Eclipse (IBM AST) cannot find imports to existing files
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am having issues with IBM's AST (which is based on Eclipse 3.2) importing files.
For example, I have a class file named "Status" in the following package:
com.test.model

When I give another class in the project the following statement:

import com.test.model.Status;


the IDE complains that it cannot resolve the import.

There are no errors on the file that is being referenced.

If I remove the import statement and try to use the Status class, the IDE gives an error about the missing reference (as expected). When I click on the error icon to insert the reference to the class file, com.test.model.Status is the first selection.

So, the system cannot find the file, yet it can find the file.

Thoughts?

That does look like a metadata workspace update issue.
This is usually taken care of with:


a project clean operation (which you did): that is enough if it is only the incremental builds that got messed up.  
deleting and re-importing the project (you delete only the workspace metadata of the project, not its content): that works best of the .project and .classpath are not within the workspace, but in an external (to the workspace) directory, along with the sources of the project
re-launching eclipse with a '-clean' option to reset the workspace perspecitve (in case of a plugin side-effect)
