Title: Make output of console application directly into Visual Studio and not external Windows console
Description: 
    
    
                    
Being a new user of Visual Studio Community (2017), I had the bad surprise to find that my C++ console application runs in a console external to the IDE.

So I would like to know how to make my program run directly in the IDE, as it is the case for Eclipse, VSCODE, IntelliJi etc....

I have already tried the proposed solution on this subject: How do you run a console application in the Visual Studio output window, instead of opening a new command prompt? but it doesn't work for my version of VSC (2017).

I would like to know if it's possible with my version and, if yes, what changes must be done with the configuration of the IDE.

How it works now

In managed code, you could try to use System::Diagnostics::Debug::Write. In unmanaged code, You could try to use OutputDebugString. In both cases, the text will go to the Output window rather than the Immediate window. If you want it in the immediate window, inside VS you can go to Tools -
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you run your program in the debugger of the IDE, you can use OutputDebugString instead of writing to standard output (i.e. std::cout). That way, your program's output will appear in the output window of the IDE.

However, this feature is only intended for debugging purposes and not for normal use.

As I work with some legacy VB6, I wonder, is there a solution to use TAB-indentation within VB6 IDE? I tried to find something for tab-indentation, and I could find only the following within the VB6 IDE,



The "Tab Width" allows one to define how many spaces to put for indentation. I guess one solution is to use one-space per tab for the future. But is there any way to use TAB-indentation within VB6 IDE instead of spaces? Perhaps an IDE add-on or a dirty hack?

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Flow for my React project as well as VSCode.

In order to make Flow supports VSCode, i've installed the flow-vs-code extension and followed the setup guidelines.

The third step is described as : 


  Set javascript.validate.enable option to false or completely disable the built-in TypeScript extension for your project


By disabling the builtin Typescript extention in VSCode. The 'Go to definition' feature doesn't work at all and is very time-consuming.
( Go to Definition =/pp/pp/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
I use Visual Studio Code 1.40.1 and the vscode-flow-ide extension and have turned off both TypeScript and JavaScript validation.

I get IntelliSense and Flow type safety. I can "Go to definition" for a function, variable, Flow type, it works as expected. Try that extension instead.
    
    
Title: Hitting local IDE breakpoints on libraries within a running docker container
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a Dockerfile containing the lines:

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt


I would like to set some breakpoints on libraries installed via requirements in my local IDE.  I am wondering how to launch the docker image such that these files are accessible from my local IDE.  The relevant modules are located within the image at:

/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages


so, i was thinking of using the line:

docker run \
    -v site_pkgs:/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages
    --entrypoint python3 \
    app-dev


but, this seems to overwrite the containers directory rendering it unable to find the modules it expects.  Any guidance in how to perform this type of debugging on a running container would be very helpful.  Thank you!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
a) If you just mean to get the python package module code in container, and have test application in your local IDE to call these modules. Then you do not need to run this container, just:

docker cp /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages .


After that, these python module's py files will be in your local(docker host). Then you can use your local IDE to debug them, of course with your own test code.

b) If you mean to use local IDE directly debug the code in container, then VSCode IDE is your choice. 

NOTE: you need to use insiders build currently, as it's a pretty new feature also I think is a great feature.

See Developing inside a Container, vscode give you ability to set IDE in your local host machine, but still can let IDE debug the code in container.
    
    
Title: How to display variable type when hovering in Visual Studio
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Visual Studio 2017 in C#. When hovering over a variable when the program is not running, a pop-up appears showing the variable type and name. However, when the program is running and hits a break-point, hovering only shows the name and value, but not the type. I would like it to display the type when the program is running as well.

For example, say I have the following code:

var foo = 100;


When the program is stopped and I hover over the variable foo, it displays (local variable) int foo. However, if I set a break-point right after that line, run the program, and then hover over it after hitting the break-point, it displays foo | 100. Is there a way to get it to show something like int foo | 100?

I've tried searching online and looked through the options provided in Tools 
Answer 1: 

    
    

  Is there a way to get it to show something like int foo | 100?


I'm afraid the answer is negative. The option which displays (local variable) int foo and that(DataTips) which displays foo | 100 are two different things. 

VS use DataTips option to show the quick info during debug mode.
For this option,it displays quick info about the variable when you hover over it, which doesn't support detailed type message like what you want: int foo | 100.

I recommend you use watch window to observe the value and type of variables.Select the variable you want, right-click and choose add watch to observe it. Or drag it to watch window when debugging to watch it.

Also, you can open a locals window to watch variables with type message in current scope.
    
    
Title: Using Tcp timeout in beast 1.70.0
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have just now updated the boost library from 1.68.0 to 1.70.0 to get the timeouts operations in (beast) websocket ssl client async example.

In the above link you will see:

void
    on_resolve(
        beast::error_code ec,
        tcp::resolver::results_type results)
    {
        if(ec)
            return fail(ec, "resolve");

        // Set a timeout on the operation
        beast::get_lowest_layer(ws_).expires_after(std::chrono::seconds(30));

        // Make the connection on the IP address we get from a lookup
        beast::get_lowest_layer(ws_).async_connect(
            results,
            beast::bind_front_handler(
                &amp;session::on_connect,
                shared_from_this()));
    }


There are more than one function which is using this structure for the timeouts. And for my code (in eclipse-cdt I see it like this



The error says (when mouse pointer hovers on the expires_after or async_connect):


  Method 'expires_after' could not be resolved
  OR
  Method 'async_connect' could not be resolved


and when the mouse pointer is taken over "get_lowest_layer", the error says


  Invalid arguments '
  Candidates are:
  boost::beast::detail::lowest_layer_type_impl&lt;#0,bool74 0 value 43 8 2 201 2
  boost::beast::detail::has_next_layer_impl
  boost::beast::detail::has_next_layer_impl 1 #0 0 71 4417 0 0/p/blockquotepstrong/strong/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
This has nothing to do with so libraries. 


boost::beast is a template library, so no shared libraries. 
Your editor uses definitions, not linking, to show this IDE errors. Basically your editor failed at finding the headers you're pointing at.


If I have to guess, you have compiled boost manually to use boost::beast, because it's not available on most modern Linux distributions. Or you're probably not using Linux. The example has some includes, and your IDE is failing to resolve them because they're not in your system includes (/usr/include). So, it doesn't know where to look. 

So, in conclusion, your build system is not coupled correctly with your IDE.

To solve the problem, try to understand how your IDE resolves missing headers. Add the include path that has the boost headers to it.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I have solved the problem in in my code (with beast 1.70.0) by setting the timeout as

void
    on_resolve(
        beast::error_code ec,
        tcp::resolver::results_type results)
    {
        if(ec)
            return fail(ec, "resolve");

        // Set a timeout on the operation
        ws_.next_layer().expires_after(std::chrono::seconds(30));

        // Make the connection on the IP address we get from a lookup
         ws_.next_layer().async_connect(
            results,
            beast::bind_front_handler(
                &amp;session::on_connect,
                shared_from_this()));
    }


I have also made some changes in my code (with beast 1.68.0) as follows

void Foo::closetimer_websocket(beast::error_code ec) {

    if (ec.message() == "Success") {
        ioc.stop();
    }
}

// closetimer_websocket is the member of class Foo. And FooObject is its instance
void session::SetAsyncOpTimeoutInSec(unsigned int time_inSeconds) {
    TcpTimer.expires_from_now((boost::posix_time::seconds(time_inSeconds)));
    TcpTimer.async_wait(bind(&amp;Foo::closetimer_websocket, FooObject, placeholders::_1));
}

void session::on_resolve(beast::error_code ec,
        tcp::resolver::results_type results) {
     if(ec)
            return fail(ec, "resolve");

    //Set the timeout
    SetAsyncOpTimeoutInSec(5);

    // Make the connection on the IP address we get from a lookup
    net::async_connect(ws_.next_layer().next_layer(), results.begin(),
            results.end(),
            bind(&amp;session::on_connect, shared_from_this(), placeholders::_1));

Title: How to execute a CustomSqlChange manually
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm writing a CustomSqlChange for the first time and want to test the outcome by running it on my current database. Of course I could start up the application and execute all change sets via liquibase (including the one that executes my CustomSqlChange), but that takes a lot of time.

Is there a way to manually execute the java class implementing CustomSqlChange from my IDE (IntelliJ) as if it would be from liquibase? Could one maybe even debug that execution?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can create a separate changelog file, where only your's custom change will be included. Point Liquibase to use it instead of base one. This will give you ability to debug it as well.

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;databaseChangeLog .....&gt;
    &lt;changeSet id="custom-change" author="author" runOnChange="true" &gt;
        &lt;customChange param="..." /&gt;

Description: 
    
    
                    
Can IntelliJ IDEA automatically fill the method call with variables? 

Possibly using the names which are based on the names of the parameters of the method which is called and even also with possibility to extract those variables as parameters of the current method?

See the screenshots below for reference.

Before: IntelliJ knows what are the names of the parameters of the method which is being called.


After: IntelliJ created properly named variables for us.


With automatic extracting of all parameters: IntellJ can automatically extract these variables to be parameters of the current method.

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It should work if there are the local variables with the same name exist in context:

  Redesign IDE Dialogs
  
  By Karl E. Peterson 03/02/2010
  
  ...Well, there's a tool you can use to do modify these sorts of
  settings to your heart's content. Resource Hacker is a freeware
  utility to view, modify, rename, add, delete and extract resources in
  32-bit Windows executables and resource files.
  
  ResHacker offers a dialog tool that's extremely similar to Classic
  VB's -- you just drag the dialog elements around, resizing them to
  suit. Or you can edit the raw resource script, and watch the changes
  play out in the dialog designer. Simply open the "Dialog" node in the
  treeview, find the dialog you want to edit, and go to town. When
  you're happy with the new design, press the "Compile Script" button,
  then just do a File | Save to write the changes to disk. (Be sure to
  make a backup of the original file, first...)
  
  To modify the Classic VB Project-References dialog, open the
  VB6IDE.DLL (or VB5IDE.DLL) file in ResHacker, find Dialog #4040 and
  get to work.


The article also included two resource scripts - the modified, wider version, and also the original as a reference / backup.

Title: How to set C++ standard in QtCreator with ClangCodeModel plugin?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I have already tried almost everything and am banging my head against a wall right now..

The problem is, QtCreator 4.8.0-beta for Windows with Clang Code Model plugin parses my project 
as C++98 whereas in fact it is C++17. However specifying the standard version explicitly in the settings dialog is not allowed ("Option "-std=c++17" is invalid").

So, how do I tell ClangCodeModel that it should parse code as C++17?
I use CMake for building the project and have set (CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17) in the top-level CMakeLists.txt file.

Thanks!

Title: Can i use vscode instead of cloud9 for web developement
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm currently going through the web developer bootcamp and got to the cloud9 setup segment, and apparently amazon bought the site. This is a problem for 2 reasons: after a year they charge for the service and that i can't register my phone because of an error on the site. I'm currently using vscode for most of my needs and i wanted to know if i can get by with it for the rest of the tutorial, which includes nodeJs, mongoDB, express etc..
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The best IDE is always the one that best suites your needs. If there’s features Cloud9 has that you can’t live without (live collaboration?) then it’s going to be better than Visual Studio Code. It’s all a personal preference.

My personal preference would be Visual Studio Code because:

It’s open source, cross platform and actively worked on.
It’s free
It’s fast enough.
It’s highly customizable (themes, key mappings, extensions).
I don’t need my IDE to live in the cloud, I have git and configuration sync so my IDE is the same on any of my machines.
Vast number of extensions for anything you can imagine (SCM integration, languages, linters, debuggers, IoT, cloud computing, etc etc)
It’s supported by a very large company and isn’t going anyway.

I don't know what I did to break my QtCreator but "suddenly" all my compiler issues (warnings/errors) are not displayed in the issues-panel any more but only in the "Compile output" panel (where I can't use them to jump to the erroneous code just by clicking).

In the "Issues" panel only the compile target (e.g. an object file) is being displayed like this:

[path/to/makefile:89: path/to/object/file.cpp.o] Error 1


I'm using Creator together with CMake (with Makefiles) and GCC. The compiler output itself seems not to be the problem (another tool which outputs &lt;file&gt;:&lt;linenr&gt;: &lt;description&gt; shows the same result).

What are the requirements for Creator to correctly parse and display issues printed by the compiler (or any other tool)? How can I investigate what's going on?

Yes, it is possible. I just got a Asus Nova Go and tried it. Compiling and running a basic .net Core app (with an Avalonia UI) worked just fine but there are some limitations and corner cases that hopefully will get fixed.

Visual Studio takes long to launch, and when lauched is not very performant.

I recently switched to Eclipse Oxygen (Build id: 20171005-1200) and my subjective opinion is that the Java code completion seems to be dumber than when I was using Eclipse Luna.  I was hoping that it was just something to do with my setup but I tried creating a brand new workspace and that did not help.  Below is a small test case where I received no proposals.  In this example, when I get to "Color." I expected Eclipse to show me a list of some of the color constants.  Instead Eclipse shows nothing.  Cycling through the various recommenders results in no proposals for everything.  Is anyone else experiencing this type of issue or have any idea how to resolve it?  I switched to Eclipse Oxygen because Lambda support in Eclipse Luna was buggy if the Lambda had generics but am otherwise disappointed by Oxygen compared to Luna

which findes code like $id == absint($id) or $id == absint($id). It works fine with preg_match function, in https://regex101.com but PHPStorm doesn't support this syntax. How can I do exactly the same thing in PHPStorm search ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It appears you cannot use recursion in PHP Storm. You may repeat the pattern though:

absint\(\s?\$\w+\s?\)\s?={2,3}\s?\$\w+|\$\w+\s?={2,3}\s?absint\(\s?\$\w+\s?\)
           ^^^^^                 ^^^^^ ^^^^^                       ^^^^^


See the regex demo (JS flavor chosen that does not support pattern recursion).

The \w matches letters, digits or underscores, and in case of a non-Unicode-aware regex, is equal to [A-Za-z0-9_].

Now, if you mean to only match the same variables on both ends, you may use backreferences (instead of the recursion constructs):

absint\(\s?(\$\w+)\s?\)\s?={2,3}\s?\1|(\$\w+)\s?={2,3}\s?abs‌​int\(\s?\2\s?\)
           xxxxxxx                 xx yyyyyyy                       yy


Backreferences do not repeat (reuse) the group patterns (as is the case with \g&lt;1&gt; or (?1)), but they are placeholders for the text captured with the corresponding groups.

But having said that, I was curious, so I did a test as I think it might be related to when things happen (like when git is engaged, or when the .gitignore is added). 

I did the following steps on a new project and it worked appropriately, so maybe that will help, you can give it a try and see if it works for you as well. I am working with 2016.1.2


Create the project

I was working on a python project in JetBrains PyCharm 2016.2 on Lubuntu and all of a sudden, all my project files have disappeared from the IDE.

I have tried the following with no success:


Exit PyCharm, navigate to project root, delete the .idea file, open PyCharm, create a new project from the current projects source.
Result: seems to load fine, but cannot see any project files in either "Project" view or individually load and view any files.
Fresh download and run of PyCharm, repeating the above step.
Result: Same as option 1.
Using File &gt; Open to open the project again.
Result: Same as option 1.


I can do a search by file or class name within PyCharm and the search does find the files. But on selecting one to load from the search results, the search dialogue just closes and the file is not loaded.

Title: Showing errors when running groovy script in maven vs. running it in IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
It is a maven project. To build and run groovy script "gmavenplus" plugin is used. When I run script in maven, even when I apply the -X option, the error looks like:

mvn -X clean install gplus:execute



  [ERROR] Failed to execute goal
  org.codehaus.gmavenplus:gmavenplus-plugin:1.5:execute (default-cli) on
  project users_rest_updater: Error occurred while calling a method on a
  Groovy class from classpath. InvocationTargetException: No such
  property: args for class: Script1 -/p/blockquotep/pblockquoteprecode/code/pre/blockquotep/pprecode/code/prepcode/code/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you just run the script as a Groovy script in IntelliJ, it won't know about any of your project dependencies.  GMavenPlus includes your Maven dependencies in the classpath it uses to execute your scripts.  To run as a standalone script, you'll have to add the dependencies needed with Grape.  Note that using Grape inside scripts executed by GMavenPlus also works.

If you're trying to read arguments passed from commandline, the arguments will be consumed by Maven, GMavenPlus won't have an opportunity to read them.  If you need the script to be invokable both as standalone and through Maven, you should set properties for Maven usage, and check in your script if they're set before parsing args.

If args is giving you trouble, you could try this.args, they're equivalent.

Title: How to order packages LESS + Remote-FTP?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I just started using Atom editor and I installed two crucial packages for me: LESS and Remote-FTP.

They both run on file save, but unfortunately Remote-FTP sends my LESS file to FTP before LESS compiles it to CSS, so I have to upload the compiled CSS manually.

Is there a solution for this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In the .ftpconfig file for remote-ftp there is a configuration option, watch. When set, remote-ftp will watch for files edited outside of Atom editor and upload them.

Example configuration using watch:

{
    "protocol": "ftp",
    "host": "example.com",
    "port": 21,
    "user": "user",
    "pass": "pass",

Answer 2: 

    
    
Problem


how to effectively document and work with a function signature that uses **kwargs


Solution


many if not most python-aware IDEs (or IDEs/editors with sufficiently-advanced python-aware plugins) can parse and display standard python doc strings
specifying both dictionary (e.g., vinput) and **kwargs parameters also allows the function to be called with name-value pair arguments or a python dictionary, increasing the flexibility of method calls


Example


in this example we simply use a YAML-formatted docstring with reminders on how the function can be called and the relevant arguments




def parse_hrefs_from_rawline(self,vinput={},**kwargs):

  '''
   - caption: parse_hrefs_from_rawline(rawline=line_of_text)
     args:  
       - rawline ;; required ;; raw line of text to parse for href tokens
       - formatas ;; optional ;; how to format the output formatas=JSON|XML|YAML
  '''

  # here we create an args variable for maximum flexibility 
  # on the ways this function/method can be called
  vargs = dict()
  vargs.update(vinput)
  vargs.update(dict(kwargs.items()))
  pass

  ## [function code goes here]

##enddef




Pitfalls


many plugins require registration or opening of the libraries and packages in order for this to work

Description: 
    
    
                    
I did not compile Qt myself, rather I used installer from official Qt website (5.6 beta is available since few days ago). Installation was successful, Qt folder conatins bin folder with qmake and everything. Building apps in Qt Creator works. 

However, when I try to launch Qt using VS addin 1.2.5.9 I get error


  No default Qt version found. Pleae check your Qt Visual Studio Add-in
  settings.


I have edited QT5 -&gt; Qt Options to contain the correct Qt path to 5.6 beta, error still persists.

I have also added QTDIR into Path in Windows 10.

I am using Community Edition of Visual Studio 2015

How to fix this? Create new Qt project under VS fails as well.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The Qt Visual Studio add-in is no longer supported in Visual Studio 2015.
Microsoft decided to deprecate AddIn support in Visual Studio 2013 and with Visual Studio 2015 all support for it has been removed. This is covered in https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTVSADDINBUG-404. However, there's an extension called Qt5Package you can install instead.

I found when I tried to add Qt 5.6.0 Beta in the extension I got the error "This Qt version uses an unsupported makefile generator (used: MSVC.NETMSBUILD, supported: MSVC.NET, MSBUILD)". The workaround is in C:\Qt\Qt5.6.0\5.6\msvc2015\mkspecs\common\msvc-desktop.conf Qt 5.6.0 splits all the version-specific changes into a separate file msvc-base.conf. If you copy the contents of this file and replace the line "include(msvc- base.conf)" in mscv-desktop.conf then Qt5Package recognises the Qt 5.6.0 Beta with no problems.

Note this still needs to be fixed in Qt5Package.
    
    
Title: Python socket server errors upon PyCharm arcpy import - what have I not set up?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am having trouble with setting up my development environment (the latest release Community build of PyCharm).  I have been using the previous version to write python scripts for ArcGIS processing.  To do this you need to import the ArcGIS python API - arcpy.  This has always been fine but now I can't seem to access arcpy directly.

I have the ArcGIS location added to my python path, to my project settings paths and can instantiate an instance of an arcpy object but trying to interact with top level methods or classes generates a socket server error (below).  For example from the interactive prompt:

&gt;&gt;    import arcpy - will work
but typing
&gt;&gt;    arcpy. - will instantly generate 


Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.3\lib\SocketServer.py", line 295, in _handle_request_noblock
Exception happened during processing of request from ('127.0.0.1', 59487)

However - if I ignore this and instantiate and instance of a map document for example

&gt;&gt;import arcpy
&gt;&gt;fullpath = r'C:\Temp\some.mxd'    # where this is a valid ESRI map doc
&gt;&gt; my_mapdoc_object = arcpy.mapping.MapDocument(fullpath)


I can now interact with the object.
What am I doing wrong with setting up my environment?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Appears to be a docstring issue that PyCharm is tripping over.

Within arcpy, within the docstring of one of the tool functions, there is an escape character, specifically \a, in a data path. If that is corrected, the error goes away.

You can use the pdb module to do that.

Title: ISCC passing a parameter in the Compiler IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I want to know if it's possible to pass ISCC option if I compile my script within the Inno Setup Compiler IDE (optimal in Inno Script Studio).

I found this question which says I should do something like

#ifndef myDefine
    #define myDefine "value"
#endif


I've already tried that because of the answer of my other question.

What I try to achive in the IDE is:

ISCC /DPHASE=test "D:\foo\bar.iss"


So is there an option in the IDE where I can pass preprocessor parameters?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
No, there's no other way than to define some meaningful defaults in your .iss file.

If you do not want the value to be directly in the main .iss file, you can import them from other file using

#include "Defaults.iss"


Maybe conditionally:

#ifexist "Defaults.iss"
  #include "Defaults.iss"
#endif


See Inno Setup Preprocessor: #include.



Note that the Inno Setup IDE does not actually launch the iscc.exe binary for the compilation. It has the "iscc" linked into itself. Were it launching an external process for the compilation, it would be possible to somehow inject the parameters.

I suggest you do the following, it will help greatly.


Read how to use pip.
Then learn how to use virtualenvironments.
Then, learn how to set up your project using setup. This will allow you properly package your application to include all your package dependancies.
From there, once you get the hang of those, you just need to look on IntelliJ help pages to connect to a virtualenv.

Description: 
    
    
                    
This doesn't affect the code, but it is kind of annoying. 

I have these 3 methods inside my controller:

public function chainOne()
{
    return $this;
}

public function chainTwo()
{
    return $this;
}

public function chainThree()
{
    return $this;

The method that is being called once hitting the specific route is this:

public function indexAction()
{

    $this-&gt;chainOne()
            -&gt;chainTwo()
            -&gt;chainThree();

}


PHPStorm says method chainThree() not found in class $this. But the code inside chainThree() is being executed without a problem. 

How can I fix it? Is it a bug?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use docblocks to help PHPStorm recognize the return value:

    public function chainOne()
    {
        return $this;

Title: Autoinsert right-to-left attributes Android Studio
Description: 
    
    
                    
I don't know all features of Android Studio, I have tried to search,but found nothing.
I wonder if it is possible to make Android Studio autoinsert attributes required for right-to-left support.
For example I have typed following line    

android:layout_marginLeft="10dp"


Is it possible to make Android Studio insert marginStart attribute automatically ?    

    android:layout_marginLeft="10dp"
    android:layout_marginStart="10dp"


And vice-versa(for padding too).
This would save some time.   

Maybe someone knows how to get such behavior, I will be grateful for any help. Thx. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Apparently, you can't do that. You have to write them yourself.

The difference between layout_marginLeft and layout_marginStart for example is that layout_marginLeft is executed for left to right languages like English, while `layout_marginStart' is only executed for right to left languages like Arabic.

So if you are going to add string translations to your app including arabic or any other right to left languages, you will need to write marginStart or marginEnd attributes... So anyway, if you didn't write layout_marginStart for example and your app doesn't support Arabic language or any other right to left languages, no error will occur to the user; it is just a warning that Android Studio tells you.

Definitely the same concept is applied to padding attributes. Hope that helps you.

Edit:

If you don't like to see Android Studio warning you these warnings, you can simply disable that by clicking on the yellow light bulb beside the yellow highlighted warning and selecting Edit 'Using left/right instead of start/end attributes' inspection settings, then uncheck it from the list.

But if you don't want to change the inspection settings, you can just add the following to your View that you don't want to use start/end attributes in it:

tools:ignore="RtlHardcoded"


and add that to your parent layout that contains that View:

xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
