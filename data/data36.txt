Title: Aptana: which one is better? Standalone Version or Eclipse Plug-in Version?
Description: 
    
    
                    
i'm new to ubuntu and wanna choose my php/javascript IDE.
there is two options for download:


  Standalone Version


and


  Eclipse Plug-in Version


the performance and not being too hight-weight is important to me.

which one shall i download?

what's the benefit of downloading it as a Eclipse plugin? does it help me to use it beside PDT or it's not recommended to do so?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The benefit of downloading it as a plugin is that you can integrate it with your existing eclipse install. If you already have a lot of other plugins installed, that might be useful to you.

If you want Eclipse to be as fast as possible you should just download a very basic version of Eclipse and only install the parts of Aptana that you really need. Instead of everything. Aptana usually comes with too much bloat for my taste, I always disable quite a bit in the General -&gt; Startup and Shutdown section.

If you just need PDT than installing Aptana is probably your easiest way. If you also want to install cDT or something than installing a regular Eclipse package might be easier. If you want it fast, you'll have to disable some plugins either way. Aptana installs more than it needs by default.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I would recommend Netbeans which supports php and symfony.

You should use the aptana plugin if you actually have eclipse.
The standalone version is eclipse tunned by the aptana people.

Good luck.
    
    
Title: Experimental IDE concepts

I am interested in building a new style IDE for a side project.  Mainly to do away with the normal notepad on steroids IDE.  I am looking for some inspiration for things that have been tried or that you have seen (or not) that looked cool and would be useful to have in an IDE.  Things that I can up with are:

Andrew Ko (formerly CMU, now professor at U Wash) focused much of his dissertation on allowing folks to debug by asking "Why did something happen" or "why he did not". The project was called WhyLine and he even had a version for Java. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I am probably a terrible person to talk about this, since I find using IDEs like programming with lead weights on my arms, but I figure it may be useful to get the perspective of that side of the fence. Any interesting or experimental ideas people come up with still need to deal with the basic needs of developer tools.

An IDE is typically an editor of some sort, a debugger, and a compiler. Since those are three distinct parts of the tool, I'll run through them seperately

Here is what I want from an editor


be fast. i never want to be waiting for things to load. ever.
give me powerful ways to manipulate and jump around in the code. I don't care about learning curves when it is a tool I use for probably 10 hours a day on average, the flip side is I don't want to waste my time getting good at tools that aren't powerful.
give me a decent way to open files. open file dialogs aren't good enough, neither are project trees. 
good support for having many things open at the same time. i have a 27" screen, tabs are nowhere near enough. currently I live with splits, but it wouldn't be hard to come up with something better.
never make me touch a mouse while editing code. again, I don't care about learning curve, what I want is speed, efficiency, and power.
If you give me a visual designer, it better make me more productive then typing, while producing code with the same level of flexibility as I am able to produce with text. I have yet to find a visual designer that does this, every one I have ever used basically lowers the bar to learning how to do something, but makes you pay down the road in maintainability and flexibility. I consider every single example of programming by drawing pictures that I have so far as a failure, if used for serious purposes (i.e. not just banging something out and not caring about quality)
automated refactorings. I am using vim now, and the one thing I miss is being able to extract methods from other methods, or hit a button to rename something and feel safe with what the tool will do.
code analysis. I want to see syntax errors as they happen, see if I am typing redundant code, or see suggestions if there is a better way to do something.
great test runner. I practice TDD, and poor test runners drive me up the wall, since it has such an impact on everything I do.


what I want from a debugger


a REPL. this drove me insane when I was stuck with visual studio, and I probably spent more time in the immediate window then anyone else on the team. The whole point of a debugger is the ability to explore what is going on during execution, if I can't type arbitrary code and see what it evaluates to, I feel like I have one hand tied behind my back
ability to change code on the fly, although with a decent REPL and language, that sort of takes care of itself
ability to move backwards and forwards in execution. 
speed, dont make me wait
good ways to jump around in the code. if I am at line 1, and want to jump to line 500 to see what is going on, I should be able to do that


what I want from a compiler


speed, at least in development mode. google go is able to compile 500, 000 loc in milliseconds on a laptop,  that is what I am talking about. If the language needs to be compiled, every second staring at compiler output is just making it harder to do whatever it is you are doing (tracking down a bug, testing a feature, running tests, etc)
you need some way to hook into arbitrary methods for pre and post execution, or pre processing of your code files in a more general way (think lisp reader macros). if you can't do it with the language, you need to be able to do it with the compiler
good analysis. tell me where i screwed up at compile time if you can't catch it before
transparency. i really don't even want to know its there, unless I am directly interacting with it.


What I have

Currently, I use vim, which gives me 1, 2, 3 (with fuzzyfinder.vim/rails.vim), 4, 5, and a very poor 8 (with syntastic.vim). I don't have refactorings or code analysis, and I really miss it, but IMO it is more then worth the tradeoff.

for debugging, I use ruby-debug, which really isn't that great. basically you get 1, 2 (more cause of ruby then ruby-debug), and 3, but thats it. 

Don't use a compiler anymore (thank god), but not using one after having to use one for 7 years (at least professionally) really highlights what a terrible impact they have on the development process.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
How about interactive code changes across networks? So you make a change to the code and the change is automatically updated on your buddy's machine across the room. Could make for some interesting development techniques. Would probably result in complete chaos, but hey! It's an idea!

Edit: I'll expand on this. Current repository systems like SVN or TFS can get just plain annoying when dealing with conflicts. If changes that another developer made could be immediately reflected in your system, possibly highlighted in some way, then it would be easier to know what not mess with. 

Further, it's a real pain when I edit one function of a class and another developer adds a function to the class so TFS detects a conflict and I have to manually resolve it. What would be cool would be the ability to obtain a lock not on a specific file but a specific scope. So I could check out a function and leave the rest of the file open to editing!

Do not forget good old Zope, providing through-the-web development for many years
(Parts of Zope have been open source as far back as 1996, with the whole application server open source since 1998).

What is Zope?
Zope is an open source web application server primarily written in the Python programming language. It features a transactional object database which can store not only content and custom data, but also dynamic HTML templates, scripts, a search engine, and relational database (RDBMS) connections and code. It features a strong through-the-web development model, allowing you to update your web site from anywhere in the world. To allow for this, Zope also features a tightly integrated security model. Built around the concept of &quot;safe delegation of control&quot;, Zope's security architecture also allows you to turn control over parts of a web site to other organizations or individuals.

Title: How do I use MiG Layout with Eclipse?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been Googling and checking on Stack Overflow and nothing has helped... hopefully someone can.

I usually just write my code by hand, but I'm working on a Java project that has a GUI aspect and I like what MiG Layout has to offer so I want to use it. I've downloaded the .jar file from the website, but I can't seem to be able to access it from my project.

I'm using Eclipse now as my IDE for this project because I don't want to have to deal with this particular thing by hand. I'm new to Eclipse, but here's what I've been trying: import the .jar file (via the Import tool for the project), then add the following code to my files:

import net.miginfocom.swing.MigLayout;
import javax.swing.*;


According to this page, this should work, right?

But when I try to run the program, I'm met with this message:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: 
    MigLayout cannot be resolved to a type


What am I doing wrong?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It sounds like the "import tool" part didn't work properly - that Eclipse isn't actually using the jar file.

I suggest you right-click on the project, choose Properties, and go to the Build Path page. Look under the "Libraries" tab. Assuming the jar file isn't there, add it and all should be well.

OK, so this is the background... I'm going to manually fix the multiple resource header files in our project. That involves fixing this value, among other things: #define _APS_NEXT_SYMED_VALUE ... that is automatically written to in (normally) resource.h.

It's documented as having this purpose:


  _APS_NEXT_SYMED_VALUE is the next symbol value that will be issued when
  you manually assign a symbol value
  using the New command in the Symbol
  Browser.


But where is the Symbol Browser!? I want to know, as I want to know what I'm setting these values for. I know what the Class Browser/View is, I know what the Object Browser is, but this is driving me nuts. :-D I've even googled for "visual studio" "symbol browser", but came up with no documentation of the browser in question.

Title: Does a language-specific IDE have any advantages over a plugin for a multi-language IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I do mostly Java and C/C++ development, but I'm starting to do more web development (PHP, Rails) and Eiffel (learning a new language is always good).

Currently, I use Eclipse for Java, C/C++, and Ruby (not Rails). Since I know the environment, I'm thinking that it would be easier for me to find a plugin and use Eclipse for all of my development languages. But are there cases where a language-specific IDE (EiffelStudio for Eiffel, as an example) would be better than Eclipse?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I have used many many IDE's and in most cases to me it breaks down to personal preferences. Sometimes the language specific ones have some addins/addons/features that are nice but unless they are things you can not live without you should go with what is most comfortable for you.

I would think that if you are comfortable with the multi-language IDE it would be better to stick with that one. This way you dont have to memorize multiple IDE layouts, keyboard shortcuts etc.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Mastering an IDE takes time and energy. Using a multi-language IDE is definitively beneficial for a programmer who needs to develop in several languages. It is for the same reason that tools like VI and Emacs are so popular.

On the other side, IDE specialized in one language could sometimes go much further on some aspect and could be the preferred choice in some situations.

I love Eclipse as Java IDE (so much that we decided to build some Eclipse based application) and I'm an Emacs fan. But I also like the Groovy support of IntelliJ and the efficiency of EiffelStudio.

It's a matter of taste, you forgive the ones you love...
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
It entirely depends on the user and the language itself, if you are comfortable with the keyboard shortcuts then you can consider the plugin else you can go for a IDE . However most of the IDE comes with a cross-functional key maps so you use the key maps which u are more comfortable with....

Description: 
    
    
                    
In IntelliJ IDEA, I can disable some inspections for a class, method, or other units. I have a module in a project that's a library that I am not the only consumer of. I do not use all the methods in the library and consequently a large number are marked 'unused'. These are all false positives. I would like to disable these inspections for this module alone (ideally, I'd like to disable unused warnings for public/protected methods).

Is this possible? If so, how would one go about doing this?

You need to define a custom scope and configure the inspections' scope.

Go to Settings -&gt; Appearance &amp; Behavior -&gt; Scope and create a new scope. Include recursively all files, then exclude the given project library.

Then go to Settings -&gt; Editor -&gt; Inspections and choose the inspections you want to disable for that project library, e.g. Declaration redundancy -&gt; Unused symbol. In the severity settings (on the right side under &quot;Description&quot;) choose your newly defined scope.


Per default the severity settings look like this (if the settings apply for all scopes):

Title: Is there any risk in upgrading from VS2010 to VS2012 in the middle of project development?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have been working on a rather large project for approximately two years in VS2010. I just got a license for VS2012 but I have some fears regarding what may happen if I remove VS2010 and attempt to work on the project in VS2012.

Is this an irrational fear or can there be issues getting the project to compile? My project is a C#, .Net 4, Winforms application.

Ideally I would just load VS2012 on another computer and give it a try, but I'm running short on computers at the current moment in time. And I've read about some downfalls to having VS2010 and VS2012 installed jointly.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I had no problems updating from 2010 to 2012. In work our main project (250,000 lines of code) has people working on it in both VS 2010 and VS 2012, and there's no issue committing (using Git, if that makes any difference).

There have been projects that won't update from 2008 to 2012 without complications, but in my experience, 2010-2012 has been pretty seamless.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Visual Studio 2012 will not change the fact that your project is a WinForms C# project targeting .Net Framework 4.0.

In my experience, the only change 2012 made to a 2010 solution was in the first few lines of the solution file.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Making a change like this increases the failure chances of the project, even when it's a necessary change. I'd say if it's not broken, don't fix it. While it is nice to work with the most recent tools, making a tool change for the sake of a tool change in an ongoing project of size is generally too risky. It would be best to wait until you reach a delivery milestone, release the product, then devote a development cycle, probably a short one, to the tool upgrade.

With that said, in general, VS2010 to VS2012 is a lot smoother than VS2008 to VS2010. The only problems I've encountered with it were straightening out some references that didn't carry over correctly on some projects and difficulties communicating wih an old version of TFS server (switching to a newer server fixed that one). 

I've had both VS2010 and VS2012 on more than one system (along with VS2005 and VS2008 in some cases) with no issues. 
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
We've updated a lot of projects without any real issues. There are some subtleties ( Marius David) and my guys have seen dot net 4.0 GAC assembly changes you'll need to be aware of. I make and run prototypical stuff in both 2010 and 2012 on the same machine. No conflicts. When I double-click a project it loads the proper IDE without asking - kinda nice.

Title: How Do I Setup the Notepad++ Run Command for Ruby?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to setup the Notepad++ IDE so that when I press F6 the Ruby script I'm editing will run. After searching the internet I've found that putting 
cmd /K ruby "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"
into the run dialogue box that pops up when I press F5 will run basic scripts in the Command Prompt (I'm using Windows 7). 

However, if my code loads any external data such as .txt files, or as I've found with Gosu, loads any image files, Ruby complains that things do not exist which do in fact exist. 

I know my code and Ruby installation (Ruby 1.9.3) are fine because prior to now I've been using FreeRIDE, an older, somewhat buggy IDE that I've grown tired of, and my code runs fine when I press F5 using that IDE.

Some examples of the complaints follow.

If anyone could lend any help at all I'd really appreciate it.

Update: knut's suggestions have allowed me to get what I want after some inconvenient juggling each time I start the program up. There are a few problems. Using 

cmd /K "cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)" &amp;&amp; ruby "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"" 


in the default run dialogue does not work. (I get the same complaints as above.) But using NppExec and 

cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)"
ruby "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"


for that works fine, except with my Gosu code, which should draw a window and animate some images, nothing happens. However, if each time I start up Notepad++ I run the NppExec and then use the default run dialogue everything works correctly using the built in run command for that session. Any ideas to why all this occurs and how to prevent it? Also, I'd prefer to have Notepad++ open a Command Prompt window instead of running inside Notepad++ itself, as it does with NppExec. And thank you!

Update2: It appears that restarting my computer has cleared up the problem, yet now I'm more confused as to what is actually taking place. Is it the NppExec plugin that is actually allowing things to work as I wish, even though I'm using a saved script for the default run dialog? Or Is this a bug, that kept

cmd /K "cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)" &amp;&amp; ruby "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)""


from working until I restarted?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Your problem: With 

cmd /K ruby "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"


you call the ruby-script in the actual directory - and the actual directory must not be the directory of your source. In my test case it was the directory of Notepad++.

You may use: 

cmd /K "cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)" &amp;&amp; ruby "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)""


But I recommend to use the NppExec-Plugin.
With NppExec you can define a command like:

cd "$(CURRENT_DIRECTORY)"
ruby "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"


So you start your ruby script in the correct directory.

Or even easier:

You set the option Plugins-&gt;nppexec &gt;follow $(current directory) and start NppExec with 

ruby "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"

Title: Copy File in eclipse copies file name (String) instead of file to clipboard
Description: 
    
    
                    
Having some issues with Eclipse here.

For some unknown reason when I try to copy a file from one directory to another, instead of placing the file to the clipboard it just copies the file name (a String).

What happens when I then paste it to the new directory is it creates a file called Snippet.java with the file name string in this class.

Has anyone else seen this sort of behaviour before?

Edit: Nevermind guys, rebooting my machine seemed to fix the problem. Who knows what was going on there.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I have the exact problem as described by Jake Mackay and have battled with it for several hours on the grounds that copying files is fundamental to the proper use of Eclipse.

Firstly I don't think it's an Eclipse problem as I have a similar problem in Eclipse Europa and Indigo.  Also starting windows (7 service pack 1) in safe mode the problem goes away.

In my case I have narrowed the problem down to having the "Skype Click to Call v 5.10.0.9560" extension installed in "Google Chrome v 18.0.1025.168 m".  When Google Chrome is not running or running with the extension disabled the problem goes away.  From this I presume that Skype Click to Call is intercepting key board and mouse events for "cut/copy" and changing the normal behaviour.

For me installing the latest version of click to call, at this time v 5.11.0.9874 the problem also goes away.

Recently every time I copy a block of code from Eclipse and paste the code into TextEdit or a online forum using the code tags, I get the code with the rich-text or html formatting, so I have to copy into a text editor remove the formatting copying and pasting again, In the past this was not a problem I used to copy from eclipse and paste the code without any formatting at all just as plain-text, I dont know if I turn on a property or what I did for this to happen, any ideas how to fix this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Note: the rich formatting from a SWT editor seems to have always been available (bug 64498).

You could use "Edit, Paste and Match Style" in TextEdit.


  From the Edit menu, choose Paste and Match Style,
  or use the keyboard shortcut, Shift Option Command V.
  
  The pasted text will pick up all the formatting from the character to the left of the flashing insertion point. This technique works in Mail as well. 

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There is an Eclipse bug filed for this that can be voted for:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=45969

It has been open for 10 years though!

There are applications out there that think they can handle rich text but can't. So for those it looks like we'll have to carry on with "Copy-Switch to Notepad-Paste-Select All-Copy-Switch to final app-Paste" for some time yet.
    
    
Title: Release vs Debug Mode in IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've always wondered what the different "deployment modes" (Release Mode, Debug Mode, etc.) were in various IDEs (Visual Studio, Netbeans, etc.). I'm sure they mean different things based on the languages and platforms the IDE supports, but there has to be a common underlying intention with marking a project as "Debug" as opposed to "Release" Mode.

What's the difference between these modes? How does the IDE treat them differently at compile/run/deployment time? Is there a way for you to customize your own Mode ("Dev Mode", "QA Mode", etc.)? If so, what are typical custom setups?

Thanks!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Typically Debug Mode contains all possible forms of debugging information, which are stripped out in the Release Modes.

This is an inheritance from native languages like C where you run the code you generate.  It is much less a problem with Java as the typical usage is through a JVM doing an additional compilation step.

Debugging information may be very handy even for a Release Mode build, as it allows the JVM to provide more detailed information in stack traces etc.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
In certain IDEs (Mostly C,C++) debug mode also initializes variables to 0. You need to keep that in mind if something works in debug mode and not in Release mode.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
In most cases you can use this mode to switch on and off some debugging information (logging).

As far as I remember right: In .net / Visual Studio you can use it for example even to define sections of code that are compiled in dependence to some variables controlled by this mode. @see &quot;Design Mode&quot; preprocessor directive
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
You can put debug="off" in build.xml file.

Indicates whether source should be compiled with debug information; defaults to off.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes, you need an Intel-based Mac to develop for iPhone/iPad if you want to do so with their native SDK.

There are workarounds, a few of which are listed here but they may be rendered unusable with the latest version of iPhone OS since they will soon disallow just about anything that doesn't use the native SDK

Answer 5: 

    
    
The iPhone and iPad SDK relies on code that comes packaged with the Mac OS.  If you want to build legitimate applications and have the possibility of listing those apps in the iTunes store, you must build them on a Mac.

There are ways around this to build apps that will never be distributed ... but those methods tend to be highly illegal.

While I am not an attorney, based upon the new SDK agreement, I believe you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create native iPhone/iPad apps.  There is actually a book already there that talks about how to do that.  Here is the book, http://www.amazon.com/Building-iPhone-Apps-HTML-JavaScript/dp/0596805780/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1274474001&amp;sr=8-1
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
If you want to create small simple apps for iPhone/iPad, you can create a Web app that runs in Safari using HTML. You can actually create fairly slick apps with this method and make them look like native apps. I've create some using jQTouch and they look like native apps. You can test them either in Safari on Windows or on your iPhone or iPad.
    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
It wouldn't be easy to develop an iPhone/iPad application on Windows.  You would have to install OSX86 on your PC, or run a virtualized OSX install through vmware if possible.  Apple is incredibly restrictive on software provisioning and app store approval, so you may have a hard time testing and releasing your app later on.  For these reasons and more, I'm switching to Android development.

Title: Highlight all references to X?
Description: 
    
    
                    
The Eclipse IDE has a neat little feature that I really miss in Visual Studio.

If I place the cursor on a variable or method name, the IDE will automatically highlight all references to it in the current document within the relevant scope.

I can't seem to find an option to turn on similar behaviour in VS2008 or Resharper 4.  I know VS has a Find Usages function, but I'd like to do it automatically on the fly.

Does anyone know of a free addin which will add this functionality?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you're using ReSharper, you can highlight the usages in the file with Shift-Alt-F11. Place your cursor on the variable you want to find usages of, and press the Shift-Alt-F11 combination.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There is an add-in for Visual Studio that will do something similar called RockScroll. 
When you double click on something, it will highlight all occurrences of the item you double clicked. It also changes the vertical scrollbar to a "syntax highlighted thumbnail view" showing an overview of where the item occurs in the file.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I know you mentioned ReSharper, but CodeRush has a nice references window that you can dock and let it search for things on-the-fly or on demand.  As a bonus, you can select each usage and it will show you the context surrounding the usage.  It also works for methods.

I mentioned CodeRush since they have an express edition, which looks like it includes that feature, but I haven't tried that edition.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Visual Studio 2010 has sorta implemented this, but the feature is somewhat lacking. There is a non-configurable delay between placing the cursor and highlighting.

The RockScroll Addin is not available for Visual Studio 2010 and above.

As a replacement, the free "Highlight all occurrences of selected word" plugin will highlight all occurences of the selected string after a doubleclick. There is no delay as with the native vs2010 highlighter.

It is string-based, which means it works inside comments and string literals.

Title: How to stop visual studio from updating assembly references?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In our environment we have a Lib folder which contains various third party assemblies referenced by our projects.  For example, Enterprise Libary and Elmah.

Sometimes a dev doesn't do a get latest on that folder.  When the dev then loads a project which can't find the assembly in the expected folder, Visual Studio automatically locates another copy and updates the project references.

The problem occurs when the dev checks in the project and it screws everyone else up.

Is there a way to stop visual studio 2008 from doing this?

UPDATE: I wanted to add that we are using TFS for source control.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Here's how we guard against that at my company. (Your mileage will vary!)

Any non-system (or otherwise non-GAC) references come from our dev server, which every developer has mapped to their W: drive. We have a common DLL directory, with subdirectories by client (or vendor), and further subdirectories as appropriate. No DLLs are ever stored in source control, except license.dll as needed by Infragistics occasionally.

For vendor-provided libraries (EntLib, Infragistics, etc.), as policy we reference from the W: drive. Period. No one is authorized to reference from anywhere else. This codes the Hint in the project files to a common path. 

For in-house libraries (client and internal projects), our continuous integration process outputs the DLLs into the appropriate branch of this directory -- again, where all our references come from.

This does slow down our local compile time (for local debugging), as VS will auto-refresh these against the server every time. It's an annoyance (sometimes a project may take 5 or 6 minutes to build locally), but it's a necessary evil to work around people using different references. The advantage here is that as soon as someone checks in code for one of those references, the CI server kicks off a build and everyone gets it pretty darned quickly.

The trick to this is a stable, repeatable build process and a continuous integration server. We're using CruiseControl.NET, integrated with NAnt builds, but insert your favorite CI server and build tool here.

So far we've had zero issues as a result of this process, except when the build server kicks in while our source control system (also known as the Demon Spawn, see so many of my recent remarks) performs a large multi-file check-in. (As Demon Spawn doesn't support transacted check-ins.) However, this is a very rare occurrence -- perhaps once every 5 or 6 weeks. And a force rebuild immediately afterward takes care of it.

Just some thoughts ... This technique should keep people from screwing up your source control -- and as an added bonus, reduce the size of your source control as you won't be checking in DLLs, just dll.refresh files.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I aggree with with John on most points with the exception of putting your dlls in source control. 

I usually have a ThirdParty folder which will then have vendor product and version breakdowns so, the ajax toolkit is stored in $/ThirdParty/Microsoft/AjaxToolkit/(some version number). I like this approach because we can put a label on all the artifacts that go into making a build. 

Another idea might be to the dll's within the project so if they get the latest of the project they will get the dlls. 
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I don't think this is possible.

If you open a project file in a text editor you'll see that visual studio doesn't store hard references to assemblies but it stores a "HintPath" instead. If the reference isn't found there visual studio will automatically try the GAC.

It might be a good idea to set up a continuous integration server (if you don't already have one) this will act as an early warning system for situations like this.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Yes, this is ABSOLUTELY INSANE and is really painful. Here is another option for you:
1. Remove assemblies from GAC, as other posts suggested. 
2. Have your dependency resolution system deliver assemblies to your BIN folder. This is where all your solution assemblies would also be compiled to. 
3. Set all the references Copy Local = false AND Specific Version = False. 
The point of this is to cause assembly loading exception when debugging, because if it is not in BIN then there is nothing to copy it there. AND your solutions will compile faster because VS will not have to copy files around. AND this will prevent "undead" dlls sitting somewhere in obj directory, which VS would miraculously find and copy around...

This works well on solutions that you control. We have been doing this for years. And it is very easy to figure out if something goes off track cause then you just go looking for an assembly with Copy Local = true or Specific Version = True, which happens once in a while (forget, tired, etc. ).
My current problem is that I do not control the structure or settings of the solution I am working on, and so looking for a solution for this ancient problem. I hoped that VS team solved it... Alas... Team, stop this pain.
    
    
Title: Which declarations are valid?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Select the three correct answers (valid declarations).

(a) char a = '\u0061';

(b) char 'a' = 'a';

(c) char \u0061 = 'a';

(d) ch\u0061r a = 'a';

(e) ch'a'r a = 'a';

Answer: (a), (c) and (d)

Book: 


  A Programmer's Guide to Java SCJP Certification (Third Edition)


Can someone please explain the reason for the option (c) and (d) as the IDE (IntelliJ IDEA) is showing it in red saying:


  Cannot resolve symbol 'u0063'



    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The compiler can recognise Unicode escapes and translate them to UTF-16. ch\u0061r will become char which is a valid primitive type. It makes option D correct.


  3.3. Unicode Escapes
  
  A compiler for the Java programming language ("Java compiler") first recognizes Unicode escapes in its input, translating the ASCII characters \u followed by four hexadecimal digits to the UTF-16 code unit (§3.1) for the indicated hexadecimal value, and passing all other characters unchanged.


\u0061 will be translated to a which is a valid Java letter that can be used to form an identifier. It makes option C correct.


  3.8. Identifiers
  
  An identifier is an unlimited-length sequence of Java letters and Java digits, the first of which must be a Java letter.

Identifier:
    IdentifierChars but not a Keyword or BooleanLiteral or NullLiteral
IdentifierChars:
    JavaLetter {JavaLetterOrDigit}
JavaLetter:
    any Unicode character that is a "Java letter"
JavaLetterOrDigit:
    any Unicode character that is a "Java letter-or-digit"

  
  A "Java letter" is a character for which the method Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(int) returns true.
  
  A "Java letter-or-digit" is a character for which the method Character.isJavaIdentifierPart(int) returns true.
  
  The "Java letters" include uppercase and lowercase ASCII Latin letters A-Z (\u0041-\u005a), and a-z (\u0061-\u007a), and, for historical reasons, the ASCII dollar sign ($, or \u0024) and underscore (_, or \u005f). The dollar sign should be used only in mechanically generated source code or, rarely, to access pre-existing names on legacy systems. The underscore may be used in identifiers formed of two or more characters, but it cannot be used as a one-character identifier due to being a keyword.

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
\u0061 means a. You can use \u0061 instead of a, therefore:

char \u0061 = 'a';


is the same as

char a = 'a';


and

ch\u0061r a = 'a';


is the same as

char a = 'a';

    
    
Title: What is the Meta key in Spyder shortcuts?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have been using Emacs for a while now and figured that Meta is Alt. Problem is Spyder recognizes both Meta and Alt in its list of shortcuts.



In fact, the shortcut for end of line that works for me turns out to be Ctrl + e, just like the one in Emacs. This is confusing.

Any help will be appreciated. I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 and Spyder 3.1.4.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
(Spyder developer here) According to the Qt documentation:


  On Mac OS X, this [the Meta key] corresponds to the Control keys. On Windows keyboards, this key is mapped to the Windows key.


So we are simply following Qt usage.

Note: Qt is the graphical toolkit on top of which Spyder is built.

I'm trying to use a collection as part of a function, however I keep getting the error: "A module is not a valid type" on compile.

Even if the function simply defines a collection, I get the same:

Function CountUniqueTags()
    Dim table As Collection
    Set table = New Collection
End Function


This code is in a standard module, but the error implies I should be writing this in a class module, but Collection is a built-in class so I don't see the issue?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This was making me go crazy for a while, too.  I had code in one file that worked fine.  Copied the code, went to a different file, added and renamed the module, pasted in the code, and suddenly the code will not compile!  I read several unhelpful answers before I saw one that gave me the clue I needed.

The error message states "A module is not a valid type" (note the emphasis on the word "module").  That means the Type you are specifying (in your case, "Collection") is also the name of a Module.  

If you rename the Module "Collection" to some other name, the error will go away.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm building a rather complex web application for data visualization with ASP.NET MVC4 in VisualStudio 2012 Professional. For technical reasons (involving realtime server-side messaging etc.) I have to deploy the web app via filesystem to our production server, so I can't use the development server in most cases.

As the project grows and contains more and more scripts, deploying almost takes a minute to complete, even on 1000BASE-T ethernet, which is very annoying. It would be absolutely sufficient in most cases to "update" only specific files or folders from within my project, because most files will usually never change (JQuery and other frameworks for example).

According to this post, it should be possible to publish individual files since Visual Studio 2012.2, but it does not work for me, the described options in the context menu do not exist.

This is the exact version of my VS:

Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012
Version 11.0.60315.01 Update 2
Microsoft .NET Framework
Version 4.5.50709

Answer 1: 

    
    
For some reasons this feature described in the blog post, you mentioned, works only for Publish method "Web Deploy". I use this feature in my current MVC application and I noticed that if I switch to "File system" the described options in the context menu disappear.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Further down the comments on the link you gave (http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/2013/May/10/Publish-Individual-Files-to-your-Server-in-Visual-Studio-20122#127707) there is a note that you must have configured and saved your publish settings before the option will be present.

I can verify that a project I have never published does not have the option to publish individual files. One that I have published does have that option.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
We got several Web Projects (9.0) that we develop with VS2010. We use TeamCity for production deployment as follows:


Normal development happens with Debug build
Release build is configured to use MSDeploy with the following properties (these can be either set in the csproj file or in the TeamCity environment variables):


DeployOnBuild: true
DeployIisAppPath: sitename.in.iis
MSDeployPublishMethod: MSDeploy
CreatePackageOnPublish: true
PackageLocation: AbsoluteOrRelativeLocation\Package.zip
SkipExtraFilesOnServer: true (optional)
IncludeSetAclProviderOnDestination: false (optional, if true, can take a long time when deploying)
PublishDatabases: false (optional)
ExcludeGeneratedDebugSymbol: true (optional)
*ExcludeApp_Data*: true (optional)

TeamCity automatically uploads the built package to our production server with FTP, but you could as well just copy it somewhere.
On the deployment location, you can invoke the cmd that's outputted together with the package. You can also pass some flags, like:

Package.Deploy.cmd /y -enableRule:DoNotDeleteRule


This last step is a pretty efficient, because it only updates files that were changed.

I'm not sure whether in your case, you'd need to put the whole package on the production server before updating, or whether you can tweak the Package.Deploy.cmd to do that from the build location.

I've researched this and it appears that the designers of IntelliJ intentionally block this feature for the most bizarre of reasons, and have been doing so since at least 2012 on this ticket: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-6460 . They refuse to even let you configure the editor to warn on closing unsaved files and give you the choice of saving it or discarding your edits.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there any technique that would let one put a vector element in a watch window, and actually see it update when it changes?

This is the context.

vector&lt;int&gt; x;
x.push_back(3);


Then put x[0] into the watch window and actually see its value.

Failing a solution to that issue, what is the best alternative?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Add x to a watch window. VS should display its elements. Click on the plus link to the left to see its elements each in its own row. Click on the name of the element (i.e. x[0]) and drag it into its own blank row in the watch window. That should give you a new row watching the element you wanted. Make sure what you click on for dragging is the variable name and not its value (dragging the value will watch the value).

They also cover Eclipse and JDeveloper.

Edit: in response to your comment - no, this can't be done the way you want it.  The way a debugger sets a breakpoint is by changing a byte in the instruction where the breakpoint is set.  When the instruction is evaluated, the presence of that byte transfers control to the debugger, who replaces the byte with whatever was there before.  When execution is resumed, the debugger moves the instruction pointer to the instruction where the breakpoint was set.

A conditional breakpoint on a single line is then easy to implement - when control transfers to the debugger, he simply checks the condition, and if it is not true then he resumes execution automatically.

So, how would it work if you didn't have to attach the conditional breakpoint to a line?  It would have to be attached to every single line (just as you surmised you would need to do to achieve this effect otherwise).  I haven't had the need to do this, but I imagine it would be undesirable as it would slow program execution considerably.  A better approach might be to use your IDE to search through the code for all instances of currency to see where it might be set, and put conditional breakpoints around there.

Change the way you write software.

Rather than:

public class BreakEncapsulation {
  private float currency = 0.0;

  public BreakEncapsluation() {
    this.currency += 5;
  }

  public void updateCurrency() {
    this.currency = 20.0;
  }

  public void increaseCurrencyByRate() {
    this.currency += 2;
  }

  public void decreaseCurrencyByRate() {
    this.currency -= 2;
  }
}


Do this:

public class HonourEncapsulation {
  private float currency;

  public HonourEncapsluation() {
    setCurrency( getCurrency() + 5 );
  }

  public void updateCurrency() {
    setCurrency( 20.0 );
  }

  public void increaseCurrencyByRate()  {
    setCurrency( getCurrency() + getRate() );
  }

  public void decreaseCurrencyByRate() {
    setCurrency( getCurrency() - getRate() );
  }

  public void setCurrency( float currency ) {
    System.out.println( "Old currency = " + this.currency );

    // Set the break point here. This is the only spot in the entire system
    // where the value of currency changes. This idea follows the DRY
    // principle: every piece of information should have exactly one
    // occurrence.
    //
    this.currency = currency;

    System.out.println( "New currency = " + this.currency );
  }

  private float getCurrency() { return this.currency; }

  private float getRate() { return 2.0; }
}


Not only does this help with maintaining your code (no code duplication), it keeps a world of possibilities open. It might not help you with your current issue, but it will help you avoid a number of problems in the future.

This is a technique called encapsulation, and is closely related to information hiding.

This is possible in both Intellj IDEA and Eclipse, along with other types of condtional break points. This functionality is a function of your IDE not the JVM.

In Eclipse it is possible to set a conditional breakpoint to be checked when a variable is changed.

It is not possible for general conditions, though, to be broken "the very moment this complex conditional becomes true"

If I go to visual studio and type MyEnumerable., I'll see a list of all the methods that can executed from that object.  This list shows extension methods as well, which is great, but is there a way (a keboard shortcut?) to narrow this list down to not include extension methods?

Other than removing using System.Linq from the top of the file, no.

I don't know if you can but extension methods have a down arrow between the icon and the name, so you can at least tell them apart from the instance methods.

I've had the problem in both VS2005 and VS2008 - it comes and goes with no real pattern, and I never found a good solution. Sometimes closing the project and re-starting VS will solve it for a while...but not always.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
The best solution that I've found to work is this.  For classic asp code on a page ending with a .asp extension you can manage outlining of code by placing different functions or pieces in an asp script block &lt;% %&gt;.

Then outlining works as expected for those sections. I would still like to find a better option than this however.

Title: BlackBerry development using IntelliJ IDEA 7.0?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I know RIM has their own IDE (BlackBerry JDE) for building BlackBerry apps, but does anyone know how to configure IntelliJ IDEA to build/debug BlackBerry apps?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
RE: Chris' question about what is different... Blackberry applications can be standard MIDP apps or CLDC apps that make use of the Blackberry specific APIs.  Most developers tend to take the latter approach, and then using Blackberry's tools is required - especially if you are using some of their secured APIs and have to sign your deployment files for them to run on the devices.

A potential answer to the original question would be to use the Blackberry ANT tools to create an ANT script for building the application and reference that from IntelliJ IDEA.  Of course, that's only half the battle and to run/debug the application you'll need to connect the debugger to IDEA as noted by Alexander above.  Alternatively, you could code in IDEA and run/debug in the JDE, but that seems less than ideal, to say the least.

I use Eclipse with the Blackberry plugin.  Also not ideal, since you are forced to use an old (and buggy) version of Eclipse, but at least I'm in one IDE and can step through code running in a simulator.

Blackberry JDE integration would be a great IntelliJ plugin project.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
RIM's compiler (the one that builds the COD files) can be easily run from the command line. All you need to do is create a corresponding build step in IDEA.

Also, to make your life easier when editing the code, you may want to add the net_rim_api.jar (the one that comes with RIM JDE) to the JAR files used by your IDEA project.

As for the debugger, RIM's debugger was supposed to support the standard Java debugger interface. I don't remember what the minimum version of JDE is required for that.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Not really an answer, but more asking for clarification what is different for Blackberry dev versus other J2ME devices...

I see its a MIDP J2ME device, and so the standard Intellij J2ME support would seem to give most of what is needed.

I guess the emulator side of things might be different... but maybe you can call the jde emulator from IDEA...

Answer 4: 

    
    
I've been using IntelliJ to develop Blackberry apps...sort of.  IntelliJ is really good at indexing code, you just need to point it in the right direction.  It's editing abilities are way beyond the JDE and in my opinion it is much more flexible and user friendly than Eclipse (even though RIM has an Eclipse plug-in). 

I say sort of though as I just code in IntelliJ and currently still compile and debug through the JDE.  Hoping for better integration on that front with IntelliJ down the line, but it is an acceptable working environment for now.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Not sure if this will help but here are instructions for setting up Eclipse for blackberry development.

Maybe you can use that information to figure out what changes to need to make in IDEA.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Its very easy to integrate IntelliJ with Blackberry development given the above suggestion (using the bb ant tasks), but I've yet to successfully debug the simulator through IntelliJ. It should work, but it doesn't.

Thus, the 'integration' is incomplete.
    
    
Title: Which preferred IDE for Office JS Excel addins
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am trying to develop add-ins for Excel with the Microsoft JS API. I have read the book from Michael Zlatkovsy about building office add-ins using Office.JS. but it is a very steep learning curve (having some background on VB 6, C, C# and Java. 
The problem here is that I have no idea which is the best approach to develop the add-ins? 


Is it Visual Studio 2017
Visual Studio Code with Yo-man generator? 


I tried to contact Michael Zlatkovsky, via the email address mentioned in his book, but sadly I never got a reply and on the Microsoft docs they just state the 2 options but they do not mention the fact that a Visual studio project is not in TypeScript and if you convert it to TypeScript, only the generated JavaScript is debugged, there is no way in getting the debugger to work directly on the TypeScript code as it should. 

The error messages from the debugger in general are also not really precise.
So any advice in the easiest way to develop the add-ins would be appreciated. I never needed so much time to learn a new technology than with the Office JS approach.

Many thanks in advance,
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Great question.
Creating Office.js add-ins -- or even just a modern website in general, and Office.js add-ins really are just a website plus a manifest -- is certainly more involved than creating a VBA/VSTO project.  So to set expectations, there will be a learning curve.
Depending on your level of comfort with web tech -- and your willingness to learn React if you don't know if yet -- I would definitely recommend going down the path of using either Yo Office or Create React App.  Both of those would fall into the second camp, of using something (&quot;yo&quot; or CRA) to generate a project for you that you'd be using with VS Code, rather than starting out with the Office Add-ins project templates in Visual Studio (which are a little out of date at this point, and don't lend themselves as easily towards modern web tech like React).  You would still use Visual Studio for debugging, however.  The experience isn't 100% seamless, but it's not bad, either.  For example, the add-in Script Lab (https://aka.ms/scriptlab) was developed precisely in this way.
Last I checked, &quot;yo office&quot; -- even if you selected &quot;React&quot; as the option -- was still creating its own custom project rather than leveraging the structure of create-react-app.  Personally, I prefer CRA for its project structure and its simplified dependencies and configuration (no webpack configuration to manage, etc.).  It's fairly easy to convert a CRA app into an Office Add-in, at least for regular taskpane add-ins (custom functions are a different story, and for that you'd probably still want to keep the &quot;yo office&quot; structure and scripts).
If you're interested in going down the create-react-app route and Office.js-ify it, here are the steps:

Start with the CRA instructions, choosing the TypeScript option (more info at https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript)
On top of what it generates, you can go ahead and add Fabric React (for UI) as well as any other libraries.  If you want to see what Script Lab uses, see https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab/blob/master/packages/editor/package.json, though it might be a tad overwhelming.  The most useful super-simple library that's great &quot;bang for the buck&quot; is styled-components, which makes it easier to write your UI by essentially letting you in-line CSS into your JS/React in a very easy way.  Script Lab also makes use of Redux and related libraries (typesafe-actions, redux-saga, reselect) which are useful once they are set up, but they might be a overkill for you (esp. if you are learning this as you go).  So for now, I would stick with just the basic typescriptified create-react-app + Fabric React + optionally styled components, and call that good.
Once you have a functional website, how do you go from website to add-in?  Well, first of all, you add a CDN reference to Office.js (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/referencing-the-javascript-api-for-office-library-from-its-cdn).  Note that even though the rest of your project will be modern modular javascript (and hence import statements, etc.), for the Office.js reference, you'll use a script tag.  You'll also want to &quot;npm install --save-dev @types/office-js&quot; to get the latest TypeScript definitions for Office.  And speaking of JS, somewhere in your bootstrapping logic (e.g., whatever wraps ReactDOM.render), add a call to &quot;Office.onReady()&quot; -- see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/understanding-the-javascript-api-for-office#initialize-with-officeonready for more info.
Note that when you add the &quot;Office.onReady&quot;, you may run into a compile-time issue complaining about &quot;no-undef&quot;.  As a workaround, just put the comment &quot;/* global Excel, Office */&quot; into the JS file that it complains about, and things will magically work.  (More info here: https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs-pr/issues/691)
Next, you will need to create/add an Office manifest (an xml file describing the URL of your site, the ribbon button arrangement, etc).  The file is somewhat cumbersome to work with, but the good news is that you don't need to touch it too often.  You can use a similar file to what yo office generates, adjusting paths (e.g., to images) as necessary.  You'll likely end up with two or more manifests, one for localhost and one for your production environment... but you can start with just your localhost.
Once you've authored the manifest, you will want to sideload it into Office.  For desktop, use the instructions at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins.  For Office Online, use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing.  For Mac, use the instructions at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-an-office-add-in-on-ipad-and-mac.  If it fails to load, it means that you have an issue in the manifest, which happens all the time -- it's a very picky format.  In that case, see the troubleshooting steps at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/troubleshoot-manifest.

On a side-note, I'm surprised (and sorry to hear) that you tried to reach out to me by email and didn't get a response.  I don't recall seeing an email -- if I would, I would have answered it (at least with a short response redirecting you to StackOverflow :-) ).  This is the first I've heard of an email not reaching me.  Maybe try again?  And I'll check my spam folder too in the next few days, to make sure your new email didn't end up there...
Best!

Title: IntelliJ IDEA find usages of overriding method without finding sibling methods
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a parent class P with subclasses A and B.

I would like to find all usages of a method f of A.

So either p.f() or a.f() but not b.f(), because an instance B b cannot call A.f.

I know I can find


Calls directly to A.f. This misses:

P p = new A();
p.f();

Calls to P.f and any override. This has too many false positives.


I know there are always going to be false positives using only compile-time information, but there could be fewer.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You could use Structural Search (Edit | Find | Search Structurally...) for this. Use a query like:

$x$.f()


with expression type filter A|P. This will find all calls to f() on expressions of a type of either A or P. If you have any more classes in the hierarchy between A and P, you will need to add these to the expression type filter also.
