I'm having problems with ruby autocomplete in NetBeans.

Autocomplete works perfectly fine when I'm in a NetBeans Ruby Project. But when I use netbeans to open a standalone file. The autocomplete don't work anymore.

Is there a way to enable autocomplete for standalone ruby files?

Description: 
    
    
                    
I was staring at my code thinking how boring the text looks.
All I see is text, with no visualizable structure.

Visualizable structures would be awesome:


Background graphics such as 3D half-pipes on edge connecting the opening and closing brackets of loop scopes, nested in 3D to show how deep the loops are nested.
Wires with arrows along them showing where a goto statement points, with a code section highlight (or preview if out of viewport) of the target label.
Conditional blocks could be rendered to show the "true" code in a positive color and the "false" code in a negative color, and mousing over the background at the left edge could reveal a preview of the condition statement for that block (appended with "== true" or "== false" depending on the code context).
Icons for Types, that show up in front of variable names so you know what type they are.
Change the background of the method, displaying tiled locks or keys, depending on whether you type public or private in front of the method (a nice indicator of the default if you fail to specify either).


Is there anything out there that illustrates code like this?

I don't mean analytically generated graphics representing the code or algorthmic structure in some way.  Rather, I mean something that actually illustrates the editable code in place.

Emacs with clang auto-completion has great support for C.

You can quickly switch between C and C++ using c-mode and c++-mode, even when using a C++ compiler (by default Emacs doesn't look at the compiler, but at the source file extension).



Xcode 3 will also stop suggesting C++ code when writing C and vice-versa. Xcode 4 will do this too, but you asked for a decent IDE.

I am planning to make a Java based bare bones IDE by integrating a compiler to code in the cloud. This is for educational purpose as I am just determined to learn to develop cloud based IDE.

I want it to be something like eclipse Orion but i want it to allow for coding in java. It should allow users to code, compile and run java programs by directly writing .java files and not by converting the .js files into java files.

Can someone please suggest me an existing cloud that I should use for this. And also, I am just a beginner and I have no clue about how to proceed and the articles that I am required to read.

Koding provides you with a full Ubuntu machine, with root, so it's able to run and do what you want, programming wise.

The reason i'm suggesting Koding though, is that they have a Framework to develop your IDE for the Koding VMs themselves.

The logic here, is that making IDEs is challenging, but the biggest challenges is ensuring security between your IDE users. Using another VM platform would mean that you don't have to manage the security of your VM, and focus entirely on your IDE.

Aptana cheats. It knows jQuery and uses some local heuristics to guess when something is a jQuery collection, but it does not do data-flow analysis on the javascript to determine the type. That's why jQuery shows up, but jQueryUI and your code don't.
    
    
Title: Control+Click freeze in Delphi XE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've just reinstalled a new machine and a new Delphi XE on it, Delphi XE's control+click IDE feature (to navigate to the declaration of whatever you control+click on) is freezing, on the previous machine, it used to work okay.

Looking at activity through Process Monitor, the BDS.exe process is opening and reading the same DCUs over and over again, and seems stuck in an infinite loop. BDS.exe is also using 100% of the CPU core it's running on.

Note that this only seems to happen for Control+Click, when compiling or building, everything happens at high speed, and without errors (as far as automated and manual tests of the compiled executable go).

Any clues? I've tried with Andy's IDEFixPack, the issue happens with and without it.

UPDATE: through trial and error, it appears that the "refactoride" BPL (which handles refactoring in the IDE) is at fault, when this package is removed the freeze no longer occurs, and Ctrl+Click works again... but refactorings are entirely gone from the IDE...

Title: Why No &ldquo;Integration Service Project&rdquo; binding to &ldquo;Server Explorer&rdquo;?
Description: 
    
    
                    
When I create a SSIS package in BIDS (VS 2008), it has no integration with the "server explorer" panel.  For example, I can't:


drag and drop a (server explorer) database onto the "Data Sources" folder of the project.  
drag and drop a (server explorer) database onto the "Bulk Insert Task" for the destination connection.
select a (server explorer) database from a drop down on the properties of one of the SSIS tasks.


In short, "server explorer" might as well not exist when working in an "integration service project".  That is quite strange, because all the above "features" are so obvious.  Why does the IDE not offer these actions / features?  Or am I doing something wrong?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The short answer is, you're not doing anything wrong and no one knows exactly why those features are not available except Microsoft. As a complete guess, the server explorer represents physical databases but it's a key principle of SSIS that physical connections are always abstracted away behind logical connection managers, so you should be concerned mainly with data sources and/or connection managers.

But that's not a great explanation because obviously you do need to deal with physical data sources in order to design packages and dragging a database from server explorer to create a data source or connection manager could be convenient, as you suggest.

It's also the case that SSMS and BIDS have various limitations compared to the 'normal' Visual Studio experience you get for other project types. You might find  the BIDS Helper tool useful for improving the functionality, and you can use the Connect site to give feedback to Microsoft on possible enhancements.

Win7/x64, Delphi 6 Prof.

Win7 drives me crazy with his side effect. I describe it:

When I force the suggestion with Ctrl+Space, or Delphi do this automatically, the Delphi don't show the suggestion dropdown listbox, he is only bring my all opened forms to front, one by one.

This causes that what I typing is not going to editor window: it is going to any property of the active form, of the active control.

For example.

Ctrl+Space+"ShowMes..."

I don't got ShowMessage with suggestion listbox, I type ShowMess into my main form's caption.

Many times I need to make update pack's because the buttons, caption, etc got "ShowMes" or "Excep" or other property, because I type into these windows...

This function is sometimes broken on win7.

May I can restore the normal working mode without "bring all opened form to front"?

Alright so I currently develop on a remote server and use putty for an SSH connection to deal with SVN. I develop with Eclipse PDT only due to the fact that it has the remote system explorer, so I don't have to actually have the files on my local machine to edit them, which is great.

Netbeans is my IDE of choice, and I've been googling for a while trying to figure out how I can possibly make this work with a netbeans project. I can't seem to find any plugins/any statement discussing the possibility of a future plugin/implementation to incorporate this.

Has anyone successfully accomplished this? Are there perhaps any standalone clients I can use to achieve this?

There is always the option to set up netbeans to browse a remote folder via ftp ( http://blogs.oracle.com/netbeansphp/entry/ftp_support_added )

You could also use sshfs to create a local mount of the remote folders/files.

I do agree that you should probably be using svn/git/whatever to develop locally and then push to the live site when ready instead.

Note: Netbeans does svn/cvs built in, but git requires the third party nbgit plugin which is still in it's infancy.
    
    
Title: VS C++ 2010 Express problems (IDE/header files HELL ?)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I almost finished writing the first draft of my game's logic engine which is entity / component based. It's not perfectly based on that philosophy, but I also think that how the implementation is done differs from person to person. I'm writing in C++ using OOP, STL and virtual functions. Yes, I know that virtual functions may be slow but it's not an exercise for doing something very fast, just a logic engine which can be easily extended and easily understood by others (everything is also commented). It's just an exercise of 'software design' by a newbie to game developing if you may wish to call it that way.

My first draft is almost complete, the core services (various inits, directX, etc) are separated from the game logic and are ready to be used. I'm just trying to finish the logic engine before I can make my first prototype game (I think about an isometric ARPG). The GL engine is built like a tree of classes, starting at the top with the basic abstract class "Entity" and deriving from it more and more specific classes. There are no more than 3 or 4 levels of inheritance anywhere for good design reasons.. I think.

But I may have a serious problem: in certain classes in which I declare as member variables objects of another class, this happens: after the IDE kicks in and analyzes what I've written, it underlines those specific member variable's type (the class name) and it says it isn't declared anywhere. Then after a split of a second, the red underline disappears and it says it's ok and declared (o.O) IT HAPPENS AGAIN AND AGAIN everytime it analyses the code. This happens also in another class with another type of class. Just to be clear, I did include all the relevant headers and it SHOULD know about the type's declaration and where is it done.

Also, if I try to compile, it gives me gl_nonrenderableentity.h(21): error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before '*' and gl_nonrenderableentity.h(21): error C4430: missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++ does not support default-int in pairs for each offending variable.

I know that the cause of this is not finding it's type anywhere (which strangely, the IDE finds, almost a second after each analysis). Sometimes those errors would be duplicated in the compiler's output and after tweaking a little how the headers where included, I get only one copy per variable (and it still doesn't makes sense, I'm using include guards.. doesn't VS 2010 Express understand pragmas ?)

I think it may be a header problem, but the most intriguing thing for me is: why the hell the IDE underlines the variable's type with red, saying it can't find it and after a second or two it finds it, no more problem, but when I compile all the project it gives me the former mentioned errors above.

Every time I had a problem, I researched and found a fix on my own, even problems with the IDE (the famous msbuild bug). But I just can't figure this out and I need the help of the veterans. Anyone has a clue of why the IDE is reacting like that ? The disappearing red underline after each analysis of the IDE must mean something. I know this happens with new variables when you write until the IDE finds their declarations, but it's only once and then it's ok no matter what.. with those 2 specific classes, it always does again and again this (and those are the only ones having this problem). Other member variables from other classes don't have this problem.

Thank you. Sorry for the long post, but I've tried making myself clear as hard as I could. If anyone wants any more information, please..

SOLVED

It was a circular reference problem, just use a forward declaration and you're fine.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The only reason I can think of is a circular reference, and even though it may not be immediately evident, a simple way to check (and possibly fix) this is to add a forward declaration for the other class:

class NonRenderableEntity;

class Action:public NonRenderableObject
{
    ...
    NonRenderableEntity *userEntity;
    ...
};


Also, don't take the IntelliSense checking (red underlines) too seriously -- it's not perfect and can get confused, especially with complex references such as this.

Update: Circular references won't cause a problem as long as you only use pointers to objects. Because a pointer's size is independent of the actual object, the compiler can allocate a pointer beforehand without problems. In languages such as C#, objects are always manipulated via references (pointers) so this problem doesn't surface.

Answer 1: 

    
    
A newcomer to the scene, which IMO looks very promising - and downright baller - relative to other existing IDEs like Rattle and JGR, is RStudio. It's free software, is cross-platform, looks very polished, and even has features like automatic refactoring.

Update 2012-04-12: I've been running it for a bit on our DB server, and I love that it's a web app that saves your sessions, resume-able from anywhere else.  Plotting requires not only no X tunneling or png-writing but is easier to use than out-of-the-box R.  Extremely easy to get up and running, and it comes with packages for Debian/Ubuntu (which I use).

The company/development is moving pretty fast, aiming to be the de facto standard IDE for all R users.  If I'm gushing, it's probably because I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the IDE after a long time of using sub-par IDEs, not just for R but for plenty of other languages.  So this was a bit out of the blue.  I still need more time to really dig into it but I like what I'm seeing so far.

Answer 5: 

    
    
Although Eclipse was mentioned by the OP, I do not know if he ment it with the StatET plugin.

Eclipse with StatET is a really great IDE besides e.g. EmacsSpeaksStatistics (ESS), but as in other environments the user have to learn it's the basic usage first. The only handicap of this IDE could be the relatively high resources requirements as based on Java, but this makes the program OS independent of course.



Why I really would suggest to take the time to learn use StatET efficiently (cauction: very subjective list!):


be able to run your code really fast and easily with comfigurable shortcuts (by Ctrl+r by default),
thanks to the script editor and running environment is heavily integrated, debuging and reviewing your code cannot be easier,
configurabled environments by default (e.g.: R scripts),
you may define templates for frequent commands and those's environment (e.g.: loop, if conditions etc),
highly customizable syntax highlight,
TeXlipse integrated to view and edit tex code with ease (LaTeX support for Eclipse), 
Roxygen support for literate programming (very handy at package development to automatically generate Rd files (manuals) from inline comments),
easily extendable with othet Eclipse plugins (e.g.: spell checking, (SQL) database management, image viewer, running external programs like Sweave).




A nice guide to read is A Guide to Eclipse and the R plug-in StatET by Longhow Lam.

Answer 7: 

    
    
You've suggested eclipse; there is a plugin called StatEt which work quite well (even Sweave is supported!).
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
There is a KDE 4 based IDE called RKward. It's nice because of:


Workspace Browser
Integrating the R console
data.frames editor
Syntax colored editor
GUI frontend for installing CRAN packages

    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
If you are used to Eclipse, StatET (mentioned by mbq) is probably the right choice for you. 

That being said I have a more exotic choice to offer that you might want to consider, if you like auto suggestion and pure syntax highlighting is not enough for you. At least for me auto completion of R-Code did not work with StatET.

Now I use Komodo Edit with Sciviews-K and R64. Sending Code from editor to R works really well and the editor offers auto-completion for R-Code which is really nice – in particular if you are new to R. I work on a Mac, but it should be easy to setup for Linux too. 

I think it has lost some popularity because it wasn't to stable in the past, but at I feel it's much better now and it hardly crashes in my setup. So you might wanna give it a chance too.

EDIT: If you work on Mac Textmate with the corresponding R bundle might be interesting, too. Recently I am about to switch to Textmate. If you don't care about the $45 for textmate, it's probably the most stable choice I tested so far. But it's only available on a Mac. But hey I am really amazed by this editor (and as you can see I like testing setups ;).

EDIT: I realize this thread is still being read by someone, so I definitely need to mention RStudio. It came out of nowhere and quickly became the choice of a lot of people. And it's well deserved. It still has some bugs (like not being able to stop RSessions) but it has tremendous auto-complete with context help. But at least on my setup (Mac) it's more stable than StatET / Eclipse. Sweave and ROxygen is not really supported yet, but the developers are very active. Definitely worth trying.

EDIT II: Because it's fun to track this here's another edit. RStudio continues to win more and more users. The combination of RStudio, Roxygen2 and particularly knitr integration has likely been the largest contribution to this development. While Rstudio was rather used by applied users and in teaching and has improved to dramatically that there's isn't many situations in which another IDE / editor is a better choice. Being maried to ESS seems like to only valid reason left to not use it. Also the documentation of its ecosystem is just great.

For my case, I would recommend RKward for linux, it is a KDE. I've been using RStudio in Windows, but when I switched to Ubuntu, I find RKward easy to use, and has a good interface.



You can create a data frame without coding it with data.frame() function.

RGedit, great tool if you're keen on GNOME default text editor. Lacks autocompletion in script mode, though... but you can define snippets in a separate plugin (Snippets)... You can send code directly to R session running in the terminal window, tabbed multiple R sesions, there are several GUI templates for common data analysis (t-test, correlation), long story short, take a look at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/rgedit/

Few months ago (when I gave my blogging skills a try), I wrote a review for RGedit, here's a link (and a little bit of self-advertising):

EDIT:
Oh, and you can use Geany and set it up so you can send code chunks to R session... I've never done it, but I know it's manageable!

This might be what you're looking for. It integrated Komodo and the SciViews package. I found it a bit too fiddley (I prefer vi) but if you're looking for a full blown IDE/editor for R in Linux it's pretty close to Tinn-R for Windows and it's written by the same guys!

Title: Can I use TextMate with existing Flex projects created in Flex / Flash Builder?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am wondring if anyone has a good resource for opening existing Flex projects that where created in Flex / Flash Builder and run them using the TextMate bundle for Flex and Actionscript projects.

Basically I just want to know if I can walk into an existing project and configure this easily or am I pretty much stuck with using Eclipse ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It is doable, but it's pretty hard, cumbersome and not pretty. Don't get me wrong, I love TextMate, but for all the pros of eclipse (auto completion, profiling, etc...) and the main con of it being eclipse; I've never moved.

This is a good place to start though, there are some good AS3 and Flex bundles out there:

http://pixelate.de/blog/setting-up-a-as3-project-in-textmate

But like I said, you don't get auto completion, code lookup, etc...
    
    
Title: How to generate camelized getters and setters in Zend Studio 7 (for Eclipse)?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Example:

protected $_labelName = null;


Should generate

public function getLabelName()
{
    $this-&gt;_labelName;
}

public function setLabelName($labelName)
{
    $this-&gt;_labelName = $labelName;
    return $this;
}


But it is generates

public function get_labelName()
{
    return $this-&gt;_labelName;
}

public function set_labelName($_labelName)
{
    $this-&gt;_labelName = $_labelName;
    return $this;
}


As you could see - it looks different but i didn't found the way how to change the method name and to trim the set method param name.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
A simple workaround : name your var $labelName, then generate getters and setters, and finally refactor/rename the var so it becomes $_labelName. Works in Zend Studio 7.2 (just downloaded the trial to check it :p).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can change the method body (and comment) by clicking 

Window &gt; Preferences &gt; PHP &gt; Editor &gt; Templates


I don't think you can change the method signature though. I'll open a ticket with Zend and ask for a way to change it. It's kinda annoying that the premier IDE for Zend Framework generates getters and setters that are not in compliance with the ZF code convention.

EDIT This was fixed in Zend Studio 8. When you generate Getters/Setters, they will not include the the leading underscore indicating private or protected visibility. Any underscores later in the member name will be kept, e.g. $_foo will generate getFoo() and setFoo($_foo), while $_foo_bar (which is invalid by ZF convention) will generate getFoo_bar() and setFoo_bar($_foo_bar)
    
    
Title: Android &mdash; SDK/IDE Layout Bug (w/Custom Layouts)?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Can someone tell me if this is a bug in the SDK/IDE:

Any custom or extended layout I add to my layout XML causes the IDE to ignore the fact that there are any child views of that layout (they just disappear from the outline view/window), thus making them uneditable via the properties view/window. (I need to extend a layout to make onSetAlpha() public)

FYI: I'm developing for Android 1.5 and up, using all the latest plug-ins/updates in Eclipse

Here is a simple example of a layout XML and the extended Layout that causes this error.

[Extended Layout]

package com.test;
public class CustomLinearLayout extends LinearLayout
{

    public CustomLinearLayout(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
        super(context, attrs);
    }

    public CustomLinearLayout(Context context) {
        super(context);
    }
}


[Simple layout XML]

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;com.test.CustomLinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
android:layout_width="wrap_content"
android:layout_height="wrap_content"&gt;
  &lt;ImageView android:id="@+id/ImageView01"
  android:layout_width="wrap_content"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content"&gt;&lt;/ImageView&gt;
&lt;/com.test.CustomLinearLayout&gt;


ImageView01 is not visible or editable in the properties or outline views/windows.

Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
When you want to edit the properties of view just replace your com.test.CustomLinearLayout
with LinearLayout. 
Then you can see the view in properties and can edit the properties. After you finish editing then revert the tag to original one that is from LinearLayout to com.test.CustomLinearLayout
    
    
Title: Javascript: How to simulate cursor with arrow key control for positioning DOM edits?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm building an in-browser IDE using Javascript.  The code/widgets are stored in the document.  I want control over the editing process so I am intercepting keystrokes and displaying a simulated cursor where the edit point is in the DOM. (At first I tried using contenteditable = true but that isn't giving me enough control.)

I've made some progress so that clicking will insert the cursor at the beginning of the div and the right arrow will move to the next node, although now I am realizing that I am going to have to dig into the contents() and keep track of my cursor position in text nodes.. 

I'm wondering if anyone knows of any code out there that I can refer to or just copy or something rather than re-inventing the wheel.  I am using jQuery but that isn't a requirement.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Perhaps Mozilla Bespin can help. But IMHO if you can't use contenteditable you'll need to write a lot of code.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Eclipse + pydev plugin as the development environment. In fact my application needs a big console area and I usually resize the console and minimize it, so that whenever I run the application, it automatically shows up.

But when I minimize the console view or detach it or mark it as Fast View, the toolbar for controlling the running process and locking the scroll disappears.

Can I have both minimize functionality and Process control toolbar ?

Eclipse : Galileo Build id: 20090619-0625
Pydev : 1.5.3
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Right now, in Eclipse/PyDev, you can't have the toolbar when it's minimized (you have to open it to access it), but most of what you need should be available through shortcuts (some may need focus on a PyDev editor):

Terminate current process: Ctrl+F2

Terminate all processes: Ctrl+Alt+F9

Terminate / relaunch last launched process: Ctrl+Shift+F9

To launch the currently open editor: F9

To relaunch the last launch (provided you followed the steps at: http://pydev.org/manual_101_run.html): Ctrl+F11

To debug the last launch: F11

To show the console view: Alt+Shift+Q, C

And if you want, you should be able to configure those in the keybindings (Ctrl+Shift+L twice to open the preferences page to do so).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I used eclipse with pydev and it drove me nuts.  I use Netbeans 6.8 right now which came bundled with its own python plugin that is a lot better.   Especially when it comes to debugging. 
    
    
Title: Code samples to test IDE color schemes
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've just recently discovered how many different options we have to configure the colors of Visual Studio 2010.

Jeff Atwood posted on his blog, some years ago, "Is your IDE hot or not", where he shows a code sample to test the IDE colors. However, this sample is not very complete, in the sense that Visual Studio provides more customization options than we can test with that code.

So, could you propose a code sample to be used to test IDE color schemes, in the most comprehensive possible way? It would be good to have it in different languages, at least all those accepted by VS2010!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
For Visual Studio there's this site where you can create your own themes: http://studiostyl.es/schemes/create. It provides some sample code that covers everything as far as VS tags are concerned. Though this is taken from the coding horror link you have mentioned, it has more than it like xml, xaml, html, asp.NET etc.

Title: Is there an editor that shows WYSIWYG comments?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Has anyone seen an editor/IDE that shows WYSIWYG comments inside the code? I have seen some that show the docs of an element in a separated tab/windows, but not together with code. For example, a JavaDoc comment would be much clearer and easier to edit if it had no tags and could be edited like a snippet from a normal text document.

/**
 * Writes &lt;code&gt;Hello world!&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;b&gt;standard output&lt;/b&gt;.
 * @seealso showGoodbye
 */
public static void showHello() {


Could be something like this:


  /*
     Writes Hello world! to the standard output.
     See also: showGoodbye()
     */

public static void showHello() {



but, editable, of course.

And for anyone who happens to have some knowledge/experience with open IDEs like Eclipse, Netbeans, etc.: would it be too hard to implement this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Never seen it like that.

Most, however, have a "Hover" mode that will show you the WYSIWYG version when you hover over the class/method/variable that the javadoc refers to.

It could be a switch, but you probably would decide not to use it for the same reason web designers rarely use a WYSIWYG editor for web development.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There are a few fringe languages/IDEs out there that separate the programming view from the storage, but these are mostly research languages, and deal mostly with the code, not the comments.  Look up extensible programming for some of the stuff out there.  The general idea is to model the code as an AST in the background and provide a text-based interface to edit/display that model.  That AST can then be stored as anything, such as plain text, s-expressions, XML, or even a binary representation.

It wouldn't be much of a leap at all to go from this sort of model to one that actually prettified the comments and gave you a WYSIWYG interface.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Emacs has preview-latex, which does this kind of visual conversion for LaTeX source files.  I guess that it should be possible to do the same for your purpose.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
This doesn't answer exactly what you seem to be asking. But as for efficient creation of comments you might want to checkout Textmate. Check this video demo of using and creating comments. In particular the "banner", "head" and "todo" comment modes. Also if you need the comment formatting in specific format structure you could presumably create a customized bundle that facilitates the comment formatting as you type. I would presume that you could create entry and escape sequence to enter in and out of comment mode and have the editor wrap the text block after you complete the comment. The thing that makes Textmate popular among many folks is the extensibility of its bundle system.
    
    
Title: Microsoft Intellimouse Scroll Wheel Not Working with Netbeans 6.5 on Vista
Description: 
    
    
                    
I would appreciate any help with this problem, I have spent hours trying to diagnose it myself to no avail and haven't received a single response when posting it to the Netbeans user list and the bugs list. 

Netbeans is an excellent IDE, and I have loved it since switching over from Eclipse a few months back. I do Java on Unix and Win32, and PHP on both, plus C on Linux (using Visual Studio on Windows as well). The problem is that I am far too accustomed to using the scroll wheel while coding now, and it doesn't work with Netbeans.

I am running Netbeans 6.5 on Vista (sp1) with a Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000. The scroll wheel refuses to work in any window, and mouse gestures on my laptop track pad also don't work (less important). My platform details are:


Software:
Vista Sp1
Product Version: NetBeans IDE 6.5 (Build 200811100001)
Java: 1.6.0_03; Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM 1.6.0_03-b05
System: Windows Vista version 6.0 running on x86; Cp1252; en_AU (nb)

Hardware:
Mouse: Microsoft Wireless Lasermouse 6000

Driver First Attempt:
Mouse Driver: HID-compliant mouse
Driver provider: Microsoft
Date: 21/06/2006
Driver Version: 6.0.6001.18000

Driver Second Attempt:
Mouse Driver: Microsoft Wireless USB Mouse
Driver provider: Microsoft
Date: 26/11/2008
Driver Version: 6.31.230.0


I found a very old bug report that said the problem was because Microsoft started enabling smooth scrolling by default, meaning the Input API would spit out smaller scroll values - but no matter how much I spin the wheel the document doesn't move. 

I also tried rolling the driver back, re-installing and newest drivers etc. Would appreciate any pointers on this problem, I am sure other people are also experiencing it as I have found a lot of references to the same problem online, but without solutions. 

I tried another Logitech mouse that I have (MX5000) and it's scrollwheel also doesn't work. I assigned page up and page down shortcuts to two of the extra mouse buttons, but it just isn't the same. Please please can somebody who is using Netbeans on Vista help me out with this, its killing me!

The funny thing is, this mouse and scroll wheel work fine with Netbeans on Linux..
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
All I can do is partially confirm what you have reported.

I am running a Microsoft Intellimouse -- a Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0 on my Vista Ultimate laptop.  I can confirm that the mouse wheel works correctly in every applicable application I've tried it with -- with the exception of Netbeans 6.5.  I also have a Logitech optical wireless 4 button mouse w/mouse wheel, I'm not sure the model number.  It is on my OpenSUSE 11.1 Linux laptop.  I can confirm that the mouse wheel works correctly with every applicable application I've tried it with -- including Netbeans 6.5.  When I switch the Logitech mouse to the Vista box, everything works -- including Netbeans 6.5.  When I switch the Microsoft mouse to the Linux box, everything works -- including Netbeans 6.5.  When I switch them back, the old behavior is maintained -- the Microsoft mouse wheel does not work with Netbeans 6.5 on Vista, all other combinations seem to work fine.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Are you this a Netbeans problem?  Have you tried using your scroll wheel in any other Java applications?

I ask because there was a bug in Java related to scroll wheels for some mice not working.  This is now fixed.

It may be worth updating the JVM you use to run Netbeans since the problems you are seeing might be caused by this bug which is now fixed. 
    
    
Title: How to remove paths from tabs in Visual Studio 2008?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a way to stop the path showing in a source code tab in Visual Studio 2008?

Currently when developing an ASP.NET site, I get the path from the root plus the filename - truncated when it gets too long. So something like:


  MyDir/MyPage.aspx


for a short path and filename, or:


  MyDir/MyLong...yPage.aspx


for a longer path and filename.

I'd prefer to see just the filename (ie just MyPage.aspx), allowing more tabs to show at once and making it easier to see which files I have open without using the drop-down list or Crtl-Tab to show the full set.

In VS2005, I just get the filename - no path however long it is. Oddly in VS2003 I get the path and filename. I've scoured the options and I can't find a setting that lets me change what appears in the tabs. Searching suggests that other people have similar issues (although which version it occurs in appears to differ) but no-one could identify an option to change what appears.

Can anyone point me in the right direction to get rid of the paths in the tabs (or confirm that it can't be changed to save me wasting more time searching)?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Tabs Studio add-in can remove path from tab in Visual Studio 2008.

Answer 2: 

    
    
In my copy of VS 2008 I just get the filename, not the path.  I wonder whether it's a "web site" vs "web application" thing.  Which one are you working in?  Can you create a project of the other type and see if it still happens?  (I'm working in a web application where I get filename-only.)
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
It looks like Microsoft does not allow to do it using the standard method. I'm know ReSharper allows this, but installing a big plugin for this is a bad idea. I think I have sinse found a small plugin which allows show or hide the full path. I am sure this should exist.

Ok, so I'm trying to use code inspection in PHPStorm to find issues with my code. But an issue I'm having is that I use a lot of 3rd party libraries that I want the inspector to ignore.

Currently I'm having to suppress the inspector every time it comes across an issue in one of these libraries. Since I need to keep the inspections enabled for other files experiencing these same issues, I can't just disable the ones effected.

How can I configure PHPStorm so that a specific directory or file is ignored by all inspections?

First Solution (kind-of)

While I don’t know if there is a way to completely exclude a folder when you run inspections via the “Inspect Code…” menu item, you can select specific folders and then run a code inspection on them via the context menu:



Second Solution (kind-of)

If you have additional inspections like code sniffers running, you can also configure PhpStorm to always run these tools in addition to its own inspections on the current file.

With both options configured there isn’t a really a need to permanently exclude  folders.

I successfully configured my Tomcat for remote debugging from either Eclipse/IntelliJ. But there is only one remote connection at a time, other connections will fail to connect. Is there any way to increase the number of connections?

Here is my configuration in catalina.sh:

As far as I know it's not possible for two simultaneous connections (processes, people) to debug the same JVM. 
    
    
Title: Can&#39;t click a button on a pop-up in Selenium IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am trying to click a button on a pop-up which is opened from another pop up in Selenium IDE. I have no problem running commands in the second pop i.e. I can search for and select awards however when I try to click the Add button nothing happens. If the step is recorded in IDE the following commands are displayed:

&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;click&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;//button[@type='button']&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;click&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;id=ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_New_pickerComponents_ButtonAddToTableResults&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;


but this doesn't work. I have also tried:

 &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;click&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;xpath=//span[text()='Add']&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;


This is the HTML: 

&lt;div class="ui-dialog-buttonpane ui-widget-content ui-helper-clearfix"&gt;
&lt;div class="ui-dialog-buttonset"&gt;
&lt;button class="ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all ui-button-text-only" type="button" role="button" aria-disabled="false"&gt;
**&lt;span class="ui-button-text"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;**
&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class="ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all ui-button-text-only" type="button" role="button" aria-disabled="false"&gt;
&lt;span class="ui-button-text"&gt;Cancel&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


but no joy. I'm not sure why I can use other commands in this pop-up and not be able to click the add button.

I've had issues where I'd click a link, opening a pop up, and Selenium IDE could not find the element within the pop up. The way I was able to solve this issue, was have the "Implicit Wait" plugin installed. Instead of a "click" on a link, I did a right click and selected "open in new tab" which removed the issue of the pop up and everything worked perfect for me.

Does anyone knows how to setup an authentication of cloud9 IDE. I'd like to have an authentication so that the source codes would not access publicly and it should be logged in before can touch the source codes. 

P.S. I already have cloud9 own my network and it is working very well. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Easiest way is to plug into the connect plugin in cloud9 and add connect auth middleware to do basic authentication there. As far as I know there are no public extensions available that do this for you but some devs have added this to their own projects.

edit Nowadays Cloud9 comes with built in basic authentication (in commit cf98892)
    
    
Title: Super Buggy Netbeans Issues
Description: 
    
    
                    
So I've been using NetBeans for a few months at my job. And there are some really egregious bugs that I just cannot believe are present in most people's versions. 

My Product Version: NetBeans IDE 7.0.1 (Build 201107282000)

So basically the there are two big bugs that annoy me daily. Number one, whenever I close a project in the projects tab. THe projects tab itself closes and I have to re-open it...
Number 2, whenever I open a file from a project. It opens in the same tab group as my projects, services, and files tabs. I then have to drag it into what I see to be the editor space to actually effectively edit it.

Has anyone else experienced problems like these? Like I said I doubt this is a problem with NetBeans itself...because I just don't see how an IDE that popular could have problems this big..I suspect its something to do with some settings somewhere..

Oh, I should also note that I am not the first user of this Windows installation, so there could be software conflicts going on that I'm unaware of....
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You take Window-projects, and it comes in the left side over the source code page. There is an option (a square shaped button) at the top right corner, left to the close button, which is a "pin" option. It will attach the project tab permanently with the source.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Please get the version NetBeans IDE 7.2. It is simply superb!It solved almost all issues which were present in the older version. Especially with Database and projects tab.
    
    
Title: Should developers be limited to certain software for development?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Should developers be limited to certain applications for development use?

For most, the answer would be as long as the development team agrees it shouldn't matter.

For a company that is audited for security certifications, is there a method that balances the risk of the company and the flexibility, performance of the developers?

Scope


coding/development software
build system software
3rd party software included with distribution (libraries, utilities)
(Additional) Remaining software on workstation


Possible solutions


Create white-list of approved software where developer must ask for approval for desired software before he/she can use it.  Approval would be based on business purpose/security risk.
Create black-list for software.  Developers list all software used.  Review board periodically goes over list.


Has anyone had to work at a company that restricted developer tools beyond the team setting? How did they handle the situation?

Edit

Cleaned up question.  Attempted to make less argumentative.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
No, developers should not be limited in the software they use, because it prevents them from successfully doing their jobs. Think about how much you are paying your team of developers, - do you really want all that money to go spiraling down the drain because you've artificially prevented them from solving problems?


  1) Company locks down the pc and treats the developer as competent as a secretary


What happens when the developer needs to do something with administrative permissions? EG: Register a COM object, restart IIS, or install the product they're building? You've just shut them down.


  2) Create a white-list of approved software...


This is also impractical due to the sheer amount of software. As a .NET developer I regularly (at least once per week) use upwards of 50 distinct applications, and am constantly evaluating newer upgrades/alternatives for many of these applications. If everything must go through a whitelist, your "approval" staff are going to be utterly swamped by just one or 2 developers, let alone a team of them.

If you take either of these actions, you'll achieve the following:


You'll burn giant piles of time and money as the developers sit on their thumbs waiting for your approval team, or doing things the long slow tedious way because they weren't allowed to install a helpful tool
You'll make yourself the enemy of the development department (not good if you want your devs to actually do what you ask them to do)
You'll depress team morale substantially. Nobody enjoys feeling like they're locked in a cage, and every time they think "This would be finished 5 hours ago if only I could install grep", they'll be unhappy.


A more acceptable answer is to create a blacklist for "problem" software (and websites) such as Pidgin, MSN messenger, etc if you have problems with developers slacking off. Some developers will also rail against this, but many will be OK with it, provided you are sensible in what you blacklist and don't go overboard.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Limiting the software that developers can use on their work machines is a fantastic idea.  This way, all the developers will quit, and then the company won't have to spend as much money on salaries and equipment, resulting in higher profits.

Real answer: NO!!!
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I think developers should have total control on applications that they use as long as they can do their job with them. Developers' productivity is directly related to working environment and no one will like being restricted and everyone likes to use software they like themselves.

Of course there should be some standards in terms of version control, document format, etc., but generally developers should have right to use any programs they want.

And security should be developer's concern - company admins should care about setting up proper firewall to protect against any kinds of attacks.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
A better solution would to create a secure independent environment for the developers. An environment that if compromised won't put the rest of the company at risk.

The very nature of the development is to create crafty ingenuous pithy solutions. To achieve this, failures must happen.

Answer 6: 

    
    
I'd say this depends on quite a list of factors. 

One is team size. If you have a team of half a dozen developers, this can be negotiated whenever a need for some application pops up. If you have a team of 100 developers, some policy is probably in order. 

Another factor is what those developers do. If they compile C code using a proprietary compiler for an embedded platform, things are very different from a team producing distributed web or PC software in a constantly shifting environment. 

The software you produce and the target customers are important, too. If you're porting the Linux kernel to some new platform, whether code leaks probably doesn't matter all that bad. OTOH, there are a lot of cases where this is very different. 

There are more factors, but in the end it all boils down to two conflicting goals: 


You want to give your developers as much freedom as possible, because that stimulates their creativity. 
You want to restrict them as much as possible, as this reduces risks. (I'm talking of security risks as well as the risk to ship non-functioning software etc.) 


You'll have to find a middle ground that doesn't hurt creativity while allowing enough guarantees to not to hurt the company. 
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Of course!  If you want a repeatable build process, you don't want it contaminated by whatever random bit of junk a programmer happens to use as a tool to generate part of the code.  Since whatever application you are building lasts much longer than anyone expects, you also want to ensure that the tools you use to build it are available for roughly the same duration; random tools from the internet don't provide any such gaurantee.

Your team should say "The following tools are allowed for build steps and nothing else" and attempt to make that list short.  

Obviously, it shouldn't matter what a programmer looks at to decide what to do, so the entire Internet is just fine as long as its just-look.  Nor does it matter if he produces code by magic (or random tool) as long as your team doesn't mind accepting just that tool's output as though it were written by hand.

There are some good integrated development environments (IDE) for java, which also work on Mac OSx. Which is the best, depends a little bit on you. 

Here a short list:


Eclipse - I think one of the most popular development environments for java and some other languages.
IntelliJ IDEA - not free for commercial development, but I really like it
Netbeans IDE - the most "official" one.. In 2005 all SUN IDE products were integrated into netbeans. In netbeans is a good graphical build tool (Matisse) for Swing user interfaces included, which is nice for some prototyping or fast development and maybe more.
Eclim - If you adore vim, this could be interesting for you. It's a mixture of eclipse and vim.
