I am attempting to build some programming quizzes where we can save user responses and review them at a later date. I am quite familiar with how all the backend stuff should work, but I have no idea how to create a friendly environment for users to enter in code on the frontend. 

Here's what I need:


Syntax highlighting (at least HTML/CSS, PHP, and Javascript/JQuery
A way to specify on a per-textarea basis which language the answer should be in
Something that is compatible with JQuery if possible.


Does anyone know of a good solution for this problem?

Use CodeMirror editor which is very robust and supports various languages.

http://codemirror.net/

Take a look at the below link which gives comparison of widely used client side editors available along with their pros and cons.

Title: Alternative SilkTest IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
Coming from Eclipse, there are many features that simply do not exist in the SilkTest IDE.

My question is this:

Is there an alternative IDE to SilkTest that I could use to maintain our SilkTest scripts? Something that can offer some of the power that Eclipse and many other mainstream IDEs bring to the table?

Some of the power I'm referring to is:


Outline functionality
Referencing/Call Hierarchy
Formatter
Context based searching (function call over a variable name)
Declaration/Definition links


If the answer is "No", that's acceptable and is what I expect, but I will wait for a short time to give others the opportunity to answer. Additionally, we have the 2009 license of SilkTest. If these features are available in newer versions of the IDE, that's also an acceptable answer.

Thank you.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
For 4Test (SilkTest's classic scripting language) the answer is 'No'. 

However, for some time there are Silk4J and Silk4Net around, which allow you to create your test scripts in either Eclipse or Visual Studio, using Java or a .Net language. You can then use all the features the IDEs provide.

Note:
I work for Borland on the SilkTest team, so my answers are probably biased.

Running Ubuntu Oneric 11.10 with 1 GB RAM and 250 GB HDD Dell Inspiron Laptop.

I got some demo code from a tutorial to read XML. When I compile it, I get this message:

"The type or namespace name '.Xml' does not exist in the namespace 'System'. Are you missing an assembly reference?" (using System.Xml;)

I have the library in this path: /usr/lib/mono/gac/System.Xml/4.0.0.0_b77a5c561934e089/System.Xml.dll  
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Are you using MonoDevelop to build your application? If so, make sure that there is a reference to System.Xml in your project.
In case you are hardcore enough to "manually" use dmcs to build your application (or you are using a Makefile or some other automated build process), make sure you pass /r:/usr/lib/mono/4.0/System.Xml.dll as one of the arguments to your dmcs build command.  

Only for didatic purposes, here is the references editing option in MonoDevelop, in which you should choose to add a reference:



Note: your distro could have installed System.Xml.dll in another path, so please verify.  
Your monodoc problem is an entirely different issue and probably means either a directory or file is missing from the installed docs or there is a bug in monodoc entirely

I am looking for a PHP IDE to work with that contains a design view like ASP .NET where i can add button, tables, menus automatically. So is there an IDE like that for PHP?

Eclipse for PHP Developers does contain this exact thing - because it's a java desktop client though it is pretty 'clunky' but give it a whirl! http://eclipse.org

Edit --

Just realised you essentially want a drag and drop interface - You actually want a html editor with drag and drop functionality as PHP itself is just server side scripting, there's a bit of a difference between ASP.NET (as it's a framework) and PHP which is an actual scripting language. PHP generally just renders HTML elements - in which case you're actually looking for a drag and drop HTML interface. I'm loathed to say it but the only one I'm aware of that's reliable (ish!) is Dreamweaver.

The closest you can get to .NET/VB ide is having an editor with html widgets, edit + has this and eclipse also has some mode or add-on for html widgets.

Title: How to get rid of specific warning messages
Description: 
    
    
                    
A lot of times I like to write try catch blocks like so:

try
{
    // do stuff
}
catch (Exception ex)
{

}


Normally, I want to see warning messages telling me that I have an unused variable.  However, in this case I put it there and don't use it on purpose (I do vb6/.net interop code and it allows me to ignore an error, but still let me have access to the exception while debugging with the .net ide attached to vb6).

Is there a way that I could specifically get rid of warning messages that say:

"The variable 'ex' is declared but never used"?

I'm thinking that I would either have to get rid of all warnings about unused variables or else just live with these ones that I don't want to see, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.

Simply don't define a variable then (just name the type):

try {

catch (Exception) {

There are several bug reports out there that indicate that this is caused by some plugins, e.g. CDT or M2E. I see that you're using m2e-wtp, that might be one of the reasons.

Have you tried the Package Explorer or Navigator views? They shouldn't change the order.

Title: Moving Reports in Salesforce using Force.com IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to mass move reports to different folders in salesforce using the Force.com IDE. 

I've followed the instructions provided by SarathPM here:
http://success.salesforce.com/questionDetail?qId=a1X30000000IEOSEA4

I update my package.xml, move the corresponding files and then try to save to server. 
However, I keep getting the following errors:

When deploying:
Save error: DeveloperName: This Report Unique Name already exists or has been previously used.  Please choose a different name.

When saving to server:
Unable to save resource 'All_Leads.report' to server: IllegalArgumentException: Project and/or project package list cannot be null.

There must be a way to move reports in salesforce other than manually saving each report to a different folder. Thanks in advance.

EDIT:

I did a fresh checkout of the reports folder only.

package.xml before

&lt;members&gt;SampleConsultingDashboardReports&lt;/members&gt;
&lt;members&gt;SampleConsultingDashboardReports/AvgEngagementLengthByPracticeArea&lt;/members
&lt;members&gt;Utility_Reports&lt;/members&gt;
&lt;members&gt;Utility_Reports/X10_reports_Account_activities_last_7d&lt;/members&gt;


package.xml after

&lt;members&gt;SampleConsultingDashboardReports&lt;/members&gt;
&lt;members&gt;Utility_Reports&lt;/members&gt;
&lt;members&gt;Utility_Reports/AvgEngagementLengthByPracticeArea&lt;/members&gt;
&lt;members&gt;Utility_Reports/X10_reports_Account_activities_last_7d&lt;/members&gt;


Save package.xml, move AvgEngagementLengthByPracticeArea.report to Utility_Reports. Refresh in Eclipse, I see the changes. I try to "Save to Server" and it tells me the "Project is not synchronized with the associated Salesforce organization." I bypass the message and try to save anyway, which is when the "Unable to save resource 'Utility Reports' to server" message shows up. 

I tried Synchronizing everything with the server before making any changes. Still get the same error messages. 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I can confirm that the method described by Sarath, when followed exactly, works. You'll need a more specific repro scenario. I'd suggest trying to move just a single report. Just to be clear, the steps are:


download a fresh copy of your reports metadata via Eclipse
manually edit the package.xml to change the folder of a report. (I think you need to make sure the folder exists on the server, and that you are referring to the developer name of it, e.g. Folder_A/My_report)
in the underlying file system, move that report to a folder of that name
in Eclipse, do a project refresh from the local file system (NOT the server)
in Eclipse, do a save to server
the report should move


If this also does not work, post your package.xml before and after, and the exact steps you followed.

I just got my new computer and I'm going to learn an IDE fresh.  Everyone suggests Eclipse; therefore, I'll go with that.  I downloaded Java EE for I may use it later for java programming also.  I don't mind the bloat. 

What I want to achieve is that every time I create a new website project that HTML5 Boilerplate also gets created as a template to the project.  Anyone know how to achieve this?

Answer 1: 

    
    
If you are using Java EE eventually, I think the best strategy would be creating a Maven archetype.  This way once you have your baseline project definition, you can archetype it and create all your subsequent projects from that.

Apache - Guide to creating archetypes

If you don't have Maven yet, you can get it here.

And the Maven Eclipse plugin can be installed from the update site:  http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases

Finally, since you are new to Eclipse, you can install plugins from Help /p/div

Does anybody now, if (and possibly where) can one set behavior of ToggleComment action in NetBeans? I'm using NB 7.1 with C/C++ plugin and want to achieve, that a block of lines is commented as a couple of single line comments. Concretely
    uncommented line 1
    uncomented line2
I want it to comment (when pressed CTRL+slash) like
    // commented line 1
    // commented line 2
now I get
    /*

Title: PHP IDE compiling code on the fly similar to java
Description: 
    
    
                    
I got a question about the IDEs: With Java, you use Netbeans or Eclipse, which are very great IDEs to code. Now, if I do a misspelling, Eclipse reports it immediately with a red line (for example a function call which was misspelled).

As I know, this works with some sort of dummy-compiling on the fly.

Now, why is there no IDE at all which provides the same stuff for PHP? Just a sort of "on the fly-interpreting" which does not really execute all functions, but it interprets the code. It would sometimes make programming much easier. Is this possible at all? If no, why not?

Thanks for response ;)

The PDT Development Tools plugin for Eclipse does exactly that. Just tell it where your PHP interpreter sits. And keep in mind that it of course can't catch errors that occur at runtime. So it will only report actual syntax errors.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I have installed Eclipse Indigo (3.7.1), then I installed Aptana IDE from the update site, followed by Eclipse PDT from the update site as well. (In that order)

I now want to add the additional Aptana features, which are available in the Aptana Standalone installation as "Install New Software". So in the standalone mode, we would get that installation screen with options for jQuery support, ExtJS support, Dojo, Ruby and the works basically.

Since I have a plugin installation of Aptana in Eclipse 3.7.1, how do I access that Aptana feature installation screen? If not, how do I install all the Aptana specific features?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The "Install New Aptana Feature" menu is only available in Aptana Studio 2.0.  If you have installed Studio 3 plugins, the menu won't be there.  However, Studio 3 includes Ruby/PHP/Python support by default, and you could add additional JavaScript library support such as jQuery using the instruction here: https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tis/Using+JavaScript+Libraries.

Hope this helps.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I don't think that is at all relevant to the Aptana Studio 3.x plugin. Instead, you install jQuery support using the "Rubles" (aka "Bundles"). After installing the Aptana Studio 3.x plugin, go to the new "Commands" menu and find the "Bundle Development" sub-menu and follow it to "Install Bundle", i.e.

I have a Visual Studio 2007 project that I successfully upgraded with VS 2010. It says it builds successfully, but while the project's default build settings result in "build successful" message, there are 2 warnings that state:

does not match the Linker's OutputFile property value (C:\MaxSDK-5.1.7\sdk-build\plussz.mxe). This      may cause your project to build incorrectly. To correct this, please make sure that $(OutDir), $(TargetName) and $(TargetExt) property values match the value specified in %(Link.OutputFile).

and the file never shows up. Furthermore, the file it tries to build has an extension .DLL, but it's supposed to have .mxo.

Anything that allows me to build this thing is a big help, but what I really want to do is output to the project folder (where the source is) as opposed to my user folder.

It depends on what do you want. Geany can save a backup copy of the unedited file and also various options of saving the edit buffer. Read this nice wiki All you never wanted to know about file saving.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
To backup scripts, use GitHub.

There are other VCS's (Version Control System), but Git has a strong feature set and is fairly easy to use.  The real strength of Git, to my mind, is GitHub, which, so far as I know, is the only free-as-in-beer site which will let you create a large number of projects.  It also seems to be well run, and I find many API's I like on that site.

Use VCS to:

1.)  backup your code so that you don't lose it
1a.) backup offsite, such as to github in the event of your computer bursting into flames
2.)  keep track of different versions, comments, etc
3.)  collaborate!  Give your code to the community.  Or, fork someone elses code.

The caveat to all this is to omit passwords or other sensitive files.  Don't upload a file with your credentials for logging into e-mail, for example.  RTFM to see how to omit specific files with Git.

Finally, if you don't like Git there are alternatives, SVN has, in some scenarios, better syntax.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    

If you have just overwritten the file (Ctrl+S) and haven't yet quit Geany, you can just Ctrl+Z to the desired document state and save that file version.
If you have already quit Geany after that and haven't set up back up in Geany before, I am afraid that by means of Geany you cannot restore the file to the previous state.
Read this article about how to set up back up in Geany. Basically you can go to Edit -

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am refactoring a (rather long) C program using Visual Studio Professional 2008 (9.0.30729.4462 QFE).  I use function picker drop-down in the navigation bar to jump between functions in the source quickly.

I added a function to the top of some source code and now the function picker drop-down in the navigation bar is just wrong.  It sometimes jumps me to a different function, or inside another function.

I've tried cleaning, building, rebuilding the project, closing and reopening the project and even rebooting my computer, and nothing fixes this.

My supposition is that the IDE needs to rebuild its source code index, but I've been searching to no avail to location such a file much less how to force a rebuild.

Thanks!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Deleting the .ncb file and reopening the solution should fix the problem.

Visual studio parses your source code and stores the results inside the .ncb (Intellisense database). The file is used for auto-completion, class-view browser, etc... It usually rebuilds automatically, but sometimes it needs a manual clean.

My IDE is VS2010 (ultimate), I wonder how to see my code as IDE sees it - meanig with my define turned into code. Can it be done inside IDE, can it be done from VS consol?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can run the Visual Studio compiler from the commandline with CL /E to do the equivalent of gcc's -E (i.e. preprocessed). I'm not aware of a way to do this from the IDE itself.

As @MooingDuck says, you can output preprocessed source to a configurable file which you can view from the IDE although you can't get the preprocessed output to spool directly to an IDE output window AFAIK.

I am building a development environment for a Java EE 6 application that i would like to build with scala and run with JBoss AS 7.

I was able to get everything running with maven, but not a IDE that can hot-deploy my changes, as i would be able to do in Java.

Eclipse was my first choice, but i was not able to make the scala plugin work with WTP.

Could anyone suggest a IDE / build tool for Scala + Java EE 6 that works well?

This isn't exactly hot deployment, but JRebel is free for Scala developers. You don't have to redeploy then.

Go to Run, Debug Configurations and click the Debugger tab.

Make sure that there is a gdb debugger selected. If not click Browse find the gdb.exe. It will probably be in your installation directory (of eclipse I mean under the /bin subdir).

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm working on eclipse and sometimes I have to delete some lines of code that indeed I prefer to backup on a notepad file (because I never know if that lines of code could be useful in another moment), so I have to select all the code I have to delete, ctrl+x, open a text editor, ctrl+v, and save it somewhere.

Answer 2: 

    
    
What I'm gathering from your question is that you often modify code in such a way that you're not sure if it will work after you modify it. What you need is a software versioning system.

Often, because a coder may introduce new code that is faulty or introduces unnecessary defects, we need to revert back to the last working version. There is an easier way than "Ctrl+X"ing the code and placing it in a "recycle bin" for future use. Try using a software versioning system such as Git for better results. The source code is available online, and you can get an account for free.

In short, version control system will stop you from having to juggle files unnecessarily.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
There is something similar which will resolve your issue, the Eclipse Remus project. You can download the plugin via the Eclipse Marketplace. After installation you can open the Remus Navigation view in your Java perspective, select the code and drop the code into the Navigation-Structure of the Remus Navigation view. The dropped source-code will be saved.
    
    
Title: Can&#39;t get Flixel preloader working via flash IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm currently trying to work with flixel library via Flash IDE.

Everything is okay except the preloader - it just doesn't work.

I suppose the flash IDE does not support the directive [Frame(factoryClass="Preloader")], which flixel uses when being compiled in flex builder to create a preloader.

Any way to get the flixel preloader working with ide (without modifying flixel sources)?

UPD: Also, i want to avoid using frames.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The [Frame] metdata tag is ignored by the Flash IDE compiler, but all that instruction does is to place all the code with the exception of the Preloader class (in your example, or whatever is the defined 'factoryClass') onto the second frame. Since you have a timeline right there in the Flash IDE, you can put the instantiation of the Preloader class definition into the first frame for yourself, and add the rest of the code onto the second frame. Remember to put a stop on the second frame.

Alternatively, and probably a better solution, is to get a copy of Flash Builder, FDT or Flash Develop, all of which should respect your [Frame] metadata, or can very easily with the right flags.

More information about the [Frame] metadata can be found here: http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=946 (which is probably where Flixel got the idea from in the first place). Hope this helps.

Description: 
    
    
                    
In older versions of Xcode (before Xcode 4.1), hitting ESC would give a very useful autocomplete window, including the return value of any methods available. However, in XCode 4.1, hitting ESC gives a much less useful autocomplete helper. It dos not give the return value of methods, and only lists methods and variables which have already been utilized in the current file. Is there a way to get back the old functionality, which was much more useful?

Try deleting derived data folder which holds the project's index information (classes &amp; methods employed in the project) and reopening the project. Doing so will kick in the indexer of Xcode.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm looking for an IDE that automatically generates a cmake file from the project. Ideally I would like the project to be independent of the IDE. I am mainly working under linux but Windows is a major (and great) OS so ideally it would run on Windows as well. I'm not too bothered about that though as on Windows there is VS :).

Regards

EDIT: Yeah, I sort of see my mistake. I should have asked for an IDE that generates makefiles instead of cmake files since the cmake layer/step becomes useless (if the IDE can directly generate a makefile).
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The purpose of CMake is to generate the Makefiles and projects that other development environments rely on, so what you're asking seems a little backwards. CMake is exactly the tool that does what you're asking to do, but in a different direction.

That said, KDevelop 4 has the option to use CMakeLists.txt files instead of the usual project file, but it doesn't work very well, and I've given up on trying to use it. Instead I edit the CMakeLists.txt file by hand - and KDevelop helpfully updates the GUI appropriately to reflect my changes.
    
    
Title: Is it feasible to extract the code assist/completion part from Eclipse and use it in an other editor?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I often hear how good the code completion, coding assist features of Eclipse are compared to other editors which raises the question if these parts could be separated from the Eclipse code base.

If this part is separated with an API through which it can be told things it needs to know (where are the files of the project,  what are the include paths, etc.) then it can return the necessary information (help for a symbol at the cursor, possible completions, etc.) and any editor (emacs, vim, etc.) can use it.

Why is it not done already? Are these code assist parts tied too tightly to Eclipse internals and they can't be sepaarated easily? Could someone who knows about the internal workings of Eclipe shed some light on this?

Edit: Here's a working setup with SharpDevelop for C#, emacs is the UI and the info comes from the SharpDevelop module. See the screenshot on this page. Eclipse's completion support could support emacs and other editors similarly.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The eclim project tries to solve this problem by interfacing directly with eclipse. Thus at least an headless running eclipse is required. While eclim's focus is afaik the vim integration, there also exist plugins for other editors (emacs, textmate, etc). The communication between eclim and an editor happens through a server interface.

Maybe not exactly what you where looking after, but imho worth a look:

http://www.eclim.org/
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The content assist uses an internal model of the Java projects - without this model the content assist cannot work (that effectively).

I am not sure, how tightly is integrated to Eclipse internals, but I do know that it uses the Eclipse Resources API (file system handling) and other features such as Eclipse extensions (new completion providers can be added without modifying the code).

Alltogether, I believe to port this completion engine to other editors the mentioned editors would lose their (in some case relative) simplicity to Eclipse, thus it might not provide the smaller footprint of the mentioned editors - so I don't think, it is feasible to provide such engines effectively for other editors.

Title: Eclipse Javascript Error Highlighting
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Eclipse 3.4.2 Ganymede...

with the Web and Java EE Environment add-on installed.

I have a Dynamic Web Project with a number of scripts and html pages in it.

In my HTML file, I've added a few scripts.

&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/dojo/dojo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/getpoints.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


Since the getpoints.js file does not directly reference dojo.js, Eclipse's error/warning highlightings in getpoints.js are useless.



How can I get Eclipse to detect this relationship correctly and display the correct errors/warnings?



Edit: for reference, these are the predominant errors

dojo cannot be resolved
XMLHttpRequest cannot be resolved or is not a field
ActiveXObject cannot be resolved or is not a field

Answer 1: 

    
    
If getpoints.js is your own script, you could put a line at the top like:

var dojo = dojo || {};


That should silence the warnings.

I think Eclipse is behaving correctly, though, because it can't know that getpoints.js will always have dojo included in the HTML file. It's just checking the syntax/semantics of getpoints.js and, technically, the script won't stand on its own. Adding the above line will 'fix' the problem by making sure that dojo is always defined.

Title: Centralised buildserver for local and remote compilation
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am in a team of a few developers who are sharing a license for a compiler toolchain.  The issue that we are having is that after one developer has acquired the license to use the compiler, there is a large wait time before the next developer can use the compiler.  This is causing a lot of wasted time and frustrated people.

Since the license is very expensive, buying more of them is not an option. I was hoping to more fully utilize the license by setting up a central compiler machine which you can push jobs to and have the machine do the work.  We are also looking into automated builds to verify the source.

I've looked into buildbot, which seems mature for automated building and testing, however using it in place of building locally while a developer is in their local testing phase before pushing changes to the remote repository might be out of it's scope.

Ideally this tool would be able to sit between the IDE and compiling machine so that it appears to the IDE that the build is being performed locally. Then if any warnings/errors show up, we could still use those handy features for zeroing in on syntax errors.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You might look into the buildbot try tool.  This allows you to send a patchfile to the builder to have it run remotely, and lets you block on the result.

Provided that you have a centralized repository already, all you would have to do would be create a call to buildbot try passing in the required parameters, and put this in place of the actual compiler in your makefile/buildscript.

Granted, this would make it take a bit longer to do iterations if you're the only person compiling, but it sounds like you really have the opposite problem.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you can customize the commands used to execute the compiler, and can ssh to the central machine, then you can probably write wrapper that invokes the compiler on the remote machine using ssh. To get this to work nicely, you likely need to have the source directory mounted on both the client and the server.

If the source directory is mounted in the same place on both machines, then the script might be as simple as

#!/bin/sh
ssh $REMOTE_HOST cd "$PWD" ";" $@


This invokes the command passed as argument on $REMOTE_HOST, in the same directory on the server.

Title: Proper workflow for newbie to SVN-IDE environment
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm an interaction designer/front-end developer who has until now worked on relatively basic and loosely structured web environments. Typically I used Dreamweaver, edit a local copy of the site, had a remote development server and production server. Even when working in a small team we weren't sophisticated - no version control besides some basic DW functionality.

I'm now on a more sophisticated team working on web applications. We use subversion (and, wow, it's damn handy) and everyone has their own development instance. I've adapted my old way of doing things to this new environment, so I'm still using Dreamweaver. Because others want to be able to view/diff my code even before I check things in, I'm currently have a subversion checkout on both my local machine (using Tortoise, easy for me as a newbie, and I edit in DW) and on my instance of the dev server. So I have to do SVN updates twice to stay in sync.

I'm doing enough php and javascript now that I realized I really should switch to Netbeans, Eclipse or some other more sophisticated IDE. At the same time, I'd like to improve my workflow. 

Can an IDE meet my needs for subversion management? Should I try to move completely away from editing on my machine and instead work directly on my dev instance?

I've played around with Netbeans and am leaning towards using that, but would love thoughts on that as well. The people I work with now as "real" programmers so what I have been doing baffles them enough that they can't relate (and give me good advice).
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Personally, I recommend SmartSVN. It's a standalone app and far more sophisticated than anything I've ever seen in Eclipse, Komodo, etc. It's also free for personal use. As for your IDE, it's a matter of preference, if not necessity. I would say try Aptana first, it's based on Eclipse and geared toward your line of work.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Here is what we've setup for our development teams:


Each developer has their local machine which is Windows and has the SVN repos checked out. 
Each developer has a LAMP VM that matches our production web servers.
We use samba on the LAMP VM's to share the /var/www directory and map the shared network location on our local machines.
Developers edit the source files locally using Netbeans.
Our Netbeans project has an option to copy any changed files to a separate location.


This allows everything to stay local, everything remote stays up to date, and the remote server doesn't have all the extra SVN files.

Drawbacks:


Have to SVN Update from Netbeans or the changes might not be copied to the remote server.

You can still recover from a bad remote server state by doing an SVN Export
You do not need to do a SVN Commit from Netbeans though. I still prefer TortoiseSVN for this.

When you add files externallay (like from Windows Explorer) such as images, you have to Scan for External changes to have them copied to the remote server.

I don't know if Netbeans 7.0 has resolved this as it now checks the OS file events.


    
    
Title: From .NET to Mono - A crash while hammering WinForms
Description: 
    
    
                    
Several years ago, I wrote this Roulette application on .NET 1.1 using C# and Visual Studio.net: http://www.lonniebest.com/Roulette/

Since April of 2007, I've been using Ubuntu Linux exclusively, so today I tried to recompile that old code using the MonoDevelop IDE. To my amazement, the code built fine without errors, and I was able to run this Windows Forms application on Ubuntu.

Everything worked fine (at first), when I would spin the roulette wheel one spin at a time. It would even run fine if I told it to spin it 10 times in a row. However, too much higher (in a row) than that, the applications crashes and all I see in the MonoDevelop's "Application Output" pane is:

The application was terminated by a signal: SIGHUP


(In Visual Studio, I'd expect it to direct me to an unhandled exception in my code, but MonoDevelop only seems to display the above output in the "Application Output" pane.)

This application really hammers Windows Forms, it updates numerous form element over and over again with each spin, as fast as can be rendered. If you run it on the .NET version I posted in the link above, you'll see it update all these form elements 100+ times a second. That may not be necessary, but neither is the application as a whole, and that's what I intend for it to do.

Compiled with Visual Studio, and running on Windows .NET, the applications can do millions of spins without ever crashing.

So, what might allow me to get this code more resilient in Mono/Linux, in light of the "SIGHUP" crash above?

I've attached the MonoDevelop Solution to this bug report:

Title: IDE, Text Editor, Program that can save &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; of your code? (Auto-save backups of code)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been looking for an IDE or Text Editor that can save "snapshots" of my code. I have been coding in a lot of new languages lately using a lot of trial and error. I often find myself wanting to revert a file or multiple files because of a coding/design decisions made in the last couple of hours or even days. It would be nice if I could take a snapshot of my code periodically and reverting to a past snapshot rather than manually making copies of my files on intervals. 

I'd imagine that there has to be atleast an editor that shows version-history of a file. ( I realize I could use git or svn or any other versioning solution, but I'd like a more automated process.)

(if not an IDE, does anyone know how to configure Windows-ShadowCopy, OSX-TimeMachine, to make backups of my development folder on 45min intervals... or even a third-party program.)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Eclipse takes a local history on a per file basis... but personally I would strongly suggest using source control for this. If you use something like git or Mercurial, your commits are all local anyway - and it means you'll have a consistent snapshot at moments where you believe you've reached a useful point.

With a bit of experience it only takes a few seconds to commit your current work, and I think it's likely to prove more useful over time than automatically snapshotting either every save or at random intervals.

(It's hard to know whether Eclipse will actually be useful to you, as you haven't specified which language you'll be programming in. Admittedly there are plugins for a fair number of languages in Eclipse...)

IAR (I'm running Embedded Workbench - ARM 5.3) saves this information in a settings/&lt;projectname&gt;.dbgdt file under the project's directory.  Make sure the IDE can create and write to this file.

If that file has been put into source control (which it probably shouldn't be), it might be read-only depending on the version control system you're using.

Coda doesn't have a built in database manager - WebMatrix includes a management module for SQLCE databases.  You can create tables, relationships, indices etc, as well as work with data.

Aside from that, they're pretty much the same idea.  WebMatrix looks to have slightly better publishing power (haven't played with the publish stuff too much yet).

I've played with WebMatrix to see what it is like.  I'll stick with Visual Studio, but for web site's rather than applications, it could be quite good.

Title: Why only breakpoints tied to lines, rather than some set of state?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Why is it that breakpoints are always tied to lines, and optionally to state? Why can't we have breakpoints that are tied solely to state or state changes, and not to lines? How does this relate to breakpointing on a whole class?

We can typically suspend execution at an arbitrary point -- why can't we have our IDE's suspend execution when a certain state is hit, wherever the execution point is? How would we implement these breaks? (I assume that by the time the state change has triggered a suspension the code being debugged may have continued).

I started thinking about this recently, when I wondered if there might be a way of suspended execution when a certain file was accessed, and thought also about how my debugging process often splits into two components: targeted breakpointing and global searches based on hunches about the code is behaving.

Due diligence: related post here, at least.

addition: my particular immediate interest happens to be in c# on visual studio -- with Mark Wilkins' link below I managed to track down "data breakpoint" setting in visual studio, only enabled while debugging C++ native code.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It is possible to set breakpoints such that it stops in the debugger when a value at an address changes (data breakpoints).  I believe that in GDB it is called a watchpoint.  And in Visual Studio, you can set a data breakpoint as well (menu Debug \ new breakpoint).

I'm exploring the possibility of presenting a visual interface to users of an application that would allow them to enter some custom code/functionality in a dataflow-ish style (a la Yahoo Pipes).

I'm wondering how, in Pipes for example, their visual editor could work. Could the visual code be compiled into a textual language which to be stored in a database? Or could the individual blocks, connectors, variables, etc. all be stored in a database?

What about visual programming language IDEs like Microsoft's Visual Studio? Is the code interpreted straight from the visual interface? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
What you see on the screen is the top of the iceberg. Components are different size, difficult or simple programs, with public interfaces. In dataflow programming, these interfaces are producers and consumers (outputs and inputs), so the component can visualised as a black box with pins on its input and output sides. When you connect pins (ports), you lead one program's output to another program's input. The components are pre-compiled for you, they are ready to run, you have just set their consumers (inputs) and producers (outputs) by connecting them. That's why they are black boxes: they're programs, which you can't change (except if you got the source code).

The components are designed to be connected to others. Some cases, components can run stand-alone, but usually they have to be connected to do the complete work. Basicly, there are three kind of components:
- source: generates output (which requires further processing or displaying),
- process: receives input, processes it, then passes it to further processing or displaying,
- sink: receives input, displays or saves it, and doesn't pass it to anyone.

A typical complete dataflow construction contains a source-process-process-sink chain, where the number of process-type components can be even zero (the data generated by source is displayed by a sink component). You can think for that three components as they were one program before, but they've had broken, and you can now re-assemble them.

One of the most well known dataflow system is Unix shell. The CLI commands are the components. They're precompiled, you just define a chain by putting "|" between them. Also, most "source" commands can be used stand-alone, like ls, and most "sink" components can receive input from file defined as argument, e.g. more.

I've tried some of the editors/IDEs regularly recommended for coding JavaScript (Aptana, WebStorm, ...) but none of them has a satisfying autocomplete functionality. I'm probably spoiled by Microsoft's IntelliSense for .NET. There is some JavaScript-IntelliSense in WebDeveloper, but that seems to be a stripped-down version. The best I've found so far is WebStorm, but its code completition is easily distracted by imported libraries (offering hundreds of suggestions) and identical function names.

Did I miss an editor/IDE that uses refactoring (or something else) to offer proper code completition, so that it really "knowns" what that variable-name stands for, I just put a dot behind? Or is something like this on its way?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I always recommend Komodo Edit from ActiveState (now up to version 6, with support for HTML 5 and CSS3 as well as recent versions of Javascript, PHP, etc.) Note that you may have to install addons for the languages you're working in, but you should find them through the Mozilla-like Addon manager.

Also supports jQuery and even lets you use jQuery (along with vanilla Javascript or Python) in its powerful macro IDE.

Code completion example:

&lt;script type="application/x-javascript"&gt;
    var obj = {};
    obj.personnel = [{firstName:"John", lastName:"Brick", age:43},
                     {firstName:"Jane", lastName:"Motte", age:26}
                    ];
    // now type obj. and code completion immediately offers you "personnel"
    // note: file must be saved for the app to find all members of declared
    // variables, but I save about every 10 seconds so it's not a problem
&lt;/script&gt;

This comment confuses me.  If you import the libraries, and your code is using them, why is it bad to include the function names in the code completion suggestions?  Wouldn't you want to have jQuery's functions included if you're using it?

If you're using Microsoft's IntelliSense with jQuery, does it stick to its guns and only show JavaScript core functions?  Sounds limited to me, unable to be smart when I add libraries.


  Or is something like this on it's [sic] way?


It sounds to me like you want a clairvoyant interface.  I don't think it is on the way anytime soon.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I am trying to find all occurrences of a literal float value in Python code. Can I do that in Komodo (or in any other way)?

In other words, I want to find every line where something like 0.0 or 1.5 or 1e5 is used, assuming it is interpreted by Python as a float literal (so no comments, for example).

I'm using Komodo 6.0 with Python 3.1.

If possible, a way to find string and integer literals would be nice to have as well.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Our SD Source Code Search Engine (SCSE) can easily do this.

SCSE is a tool for searching large source code bases, much faster than grep, by indexing the elements of the source code languages of interest.  Queries can then be posed, which use the index to enable fast location of search hits.  Queries and hits are displayed in a GUI, and a click on a hit will show the block of source code containing the hit.

The SCSE knows the lexical structure of each language it has indexed with the precision as that langauge's compiler. (It uses front ends from family of accurate programming language processors; this family is pretty large and happens to include the OP's target langauge of Python/Perl/Java/...).  Thus it knows exactly where identifiers, comments, and literals (integral, float, character or string) are, and exactly their content.

SCSE queries are composed of commands representing sequences of language elements of interest.  The query

'for' ... I '=' N=103


finds a for keyword near ("...") an arbitrary identifier(I) which is initialized ("=") with the numeric value ("N") of 103.  Because SCSE understands the language structure, it ignores language-whitespace between the tokens, e.g., it can find this regardless off intervening blanks, whitespace, newlines or comments.

The query tokens I, N, F, S, C represent I(dentifier), Natural (number), F(loat), S(tring) and C(omment) respectively.  The OP's original question, of finding all the floats, is thus the nearly trivial query

F


Similarly for finding all String literals ("S") and integral literals ("N").  If you wanted to find just copies of values near Pi, you'd add low and upper bound constraints:

F&gt;3.14&lt;3.16


(It is pretty funny to run this on large Fortran codes; you see all kinds of bad approximations of Pi).

SCSE won't find a Float in a comment or a string, because it intimately knows the difference.  Writing a grep-style expression to handle all the strange combinations to eliminate whitespace  or surrounding quotes and commente delimiters should be obviously a lot more painful.  Grep ain't the way to do this.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You could do that by selecting what you need with regular expressions.

sed -r "s/^([^#]*)#.*$/\1/g" YOUR_FILE | grep -P "[^'\"\w]-?[1-9]\d*[.e]\d*[^'\"\w]"


You'll probably need to tweak it to get a better result.

`sed' cuts out comments, while grep selects only lines containing (a small subsect of - the expression I gave is not perfect) float values...

Hope it helps.

Vim or Emacs will show syntax while you're editing. One or the other ought to be available for Windows, or you can get them with Cygwin. Pick one or the other; they both have fairly steep learning curves. You can use them as just editors, or they both have some IDE functionality. Emacs probably more than Vim.

Notepad++ is a text editor and source code editor for Windows.
Notepad++is definitely my favorite Notepad replacement because of the extensive features that it has built-in.I have used notepad++ and it give me a useful result. The main thing that makes Notepad++ fit well with the Firefox metaphor is the self-update check capability.
