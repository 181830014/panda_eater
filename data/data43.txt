Title: phpstorm: change colour of current search match
Description: 
    
    
                    
I want to change the colour of the current match when searching, as the scheme I'm using (Heat of the Night) doesn't stand out very well (black on grey).

In Editor -&gt; Colors &amp; Fonts -&gt; General modifying "Text search result" works ok (which is all the matches except the first one), but "Search result" and "Search result (write access)" only effect the preview and not the actual editor window.

Is there some other setting I need to update? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Just worked it out - the editor selects each match as you iterate through them, so what I needed to change was "Selection background" and "Selection foreground".

I haven't used XE2 yet, still using RAD studio 2010. Nevertheless, the following works for me:


Go to the Design View of your new form.
Select the form from the Structure tree ( or just click on it ).
Change the name property of the form.


That should then change the class and class-pointer names of the unit.

Can't see why that wouldn't work in XE and later versions, but as I mentioned - not tested.

Update: Verified method works for C++ Builder 10.1 Berlin.

Title: Automatically move source code files to project folder in Visual Studio 2008/2010 which are added as link and residing outside the project folder
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a plugin/trick/macro for visual studio which automatically moves all files present outside a project directory and added as link, to the project directory and alters the location of the file in the project itself?

|--Project1
          |--File1.vb REM: already inside the project folder
|--File2.vb REM: outside the project folder and added as link to project1.


Is there any way to accomplish this?

|--Project1
          |--File1.vb REM: remains as it is
          |--File2.vb REM: now moved to project1 directory.

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It should not be too hard to write such a tool by yourself. The project files are just XML files, and references to source files look like this:

With links:

&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;Compile Include="..\Path_To_External_File\SourceFile.vb"&gt;
     &lt;Link&gt;SourceFile.vb&lt;/Link&gt;
  &lt;/Compile&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;


Same without links:

&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;Compile Include="SourceFile.vb" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;


So write a very simple program or script which reads all the project files to be processed, loop over all &lt;Compile&gt; items, make a copy of the source file or just move it to the desired location, and adapt the XML of the project file accordingly. If you have  ever programmed some XML processing beforehand, using, for example, theXMLDocument class, then this should be implemented in a few hours (at maximum).

One final remark: you may (or may not) have to to deal with the case where the same files is referenced from different projects.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Visual does the copy during compiling already if it's what you're looking for. On the other hand, if you want to really add the files, but not as a link, I pretty sure there is no native trick in VS for this.

Description: 
    
    
                    
it exist a fully portable compiler and IDE for C#? All the things I need to code a C# application needs to be on an USB flash drive (even the .NET framework). So, what I need is a fully integrated programming tool, to insert the flash drive and to be ready to code.

It exist something like this?

LE: I can do this by using a virtual machine. I'm asking if I can do this without it. So, all what I need to be on the USB.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can have a VM setup just the way you want it and put the image on a USB key.

There are many free and portable virtual machines you can use for this.

Update:

Since your question is now specifically about doing without a VM - the answer is no. You can't install the .NET framework on USB.

You can install an IDE like SharpDevelop or MonoDevelop on a key and possibly the Mono compiler, but not the framework as supplied by Microsoft.

See this for getting a full portable mono environment.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can also Google for "portable SharpDevelop". SharpDevelop is a free, open-source full featured C# IDE, with compiler, window designer, intellisense and a lot of bells and whistles.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The C# compilers is installed wherever a .NET Framework is. Since the .NET Framework is NOT optional in any recent Windows OS, I would say that you only need to worry about the portable IDE, and for that you might want to use, as Picacodigos suggested, SharpDevelop:

A few days back I felt this question to be dumb and dint post it here, but after even after searching a lot I dint find a proper solution.

For those of you who used TextEdit (on Mac), they will perfectly know what I am talking about.

While coding I just want to put quotes or parentheses over a word or a line.To do this I'll have to move back to the starting of the word, open the quote and then go to the ending of the word and close it.

Is there a plugin or so in eclipse where I can just surround the current selection with quotes or parenthesis ?? I am not talking about quick fix (Ctrl + 1). It can be used for much complex templates.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can do that with a custom template, so for example if you want to create this template for java, you can do : 

Preferences ---&gt; Java  ---&gt; Templates


Create a new template and call it quote, then type this as pattern :

"${word_selection}"${cursor}


Save it and Apply.

After that you can use that template selecting the text you want to quote then press CTRL + SPACE and then chose quote.

Same thing for parenthesis : 

(${word_selection})${cursor}

Posting my response from Unix &amp; Linux here as well since that thread was closed.

While there are many plugins for Vim, it really isn't an IDE. However, you can get many of the features of IDEs in Vim.

As has been mentioned, you can install plugins manually by searching for them based on features you'd like. If you are looking for something that is already mostly configured, then I'd suggest using scrooloose's vimfiles project hosted on GitHub. You can clone it into your ~/.vim:

git clone https://github.com/scrooloose/vimfiles.git ~/.vim


You may want to backup your current ~/.vim directory first.

Once it is downloaded you can install the submodules:

cd ~/.vim
git submodule init &amp;&amp; git submodule update


Finally to use the new plugins you'll have to source the vimrc file in your ~/.vimrc by adding source ~/.vim/vimrc to your ~/.vimrc.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Use Emonic.
See the FAQ:


  Which .NET implementations can I use?
  
  Microsoft's implementation as well as Mono :-) Emonic supports .net 1.* as well as .net 2.* and 3.*.
  
  Which compiler is used to compile the sources?
  
  Emonic does not use a compiler directly. The build mechanism writes creates a build file and invokes a build command on that build file. Thus, the compiler used is the compiler which is configured in the build's setup. At the moment, Apache Ant and NAnt is supported as a build mechanism. In the case of NAnt, you can choose the compiler via a command line flag. You can write this flag in the Emonic preferences of the nant-start to force emonic to use this compiler.

Description: 
    
    
                    
It'd be really cool to get some code completion support here. That is, when I type

var math = require("math");


I'd love to get more than just the usual Object properties when I type "math.".

Support for AMD modules would be ideal, but I'd be happy with Modules 1.x, especially if the IDE or the plugin implementing the support were open source.

This could possibly be done without any special support if you knew of an IDE that dynamically executed JavaScript code on the fly to an extreme degree, e.g. one that spun up a web browser in the background so as to capture all of the crazy script-loading-via-&lt;script /&gt;-DOM-insertion stuff that's going on in an AMD module framework.

The best Javascript IDEs I have used are the following.

Probably, Aptana has this feature to some extent. In most cases, you will have to provide a reference pointer to a library which would contain the methods used for code completion.

  Should I compile my wizard as a DLL or a Package? Packages are easier to
  load and unload without restarting the
  IDE (and hence easier to debug), but
  they can create unit naming conflicts
  in the IDE. Conflicts happen when the
  name a wizard's unit matches the name
  of a unit in another loaded
  design-time package. In this case,
  both packages can not be loaded at the
  same time. The recommended workaround
  is to prefix all of your unit names
  with a "unique" prefix. GExperts, for
  example, uses "GX_" as the name prefix
  for its units.


From this very good source about OTA: GExperts
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
When you access a global variable those would be global variables that are global to your DLL, not global to the main BDS.exe. I am not sure but I think your DLL would have its own Screen and Application global variable, if you linked in Forms, and the core of the VCL.

Those things which belong to the IDE itself are accessed through the Open Tools Api (OTA).  I believe that you do not normally share any objects between the IDE your expert anyways, and if you were to try to do so, it would be problematic.  Anything at all that you do that bypasses the OTA is going to be vulnerable to breaking in strange ways, especially in future versions of the IDE.  

Dependency problems are of course a big reason to not use BPL based packages, but I think an even bigger reason is to maintain a complete separation between your tool's internals, and the internals of the IDE.

Remember that a DLL target, like an executable target, is statically linked.  That is the core of the difference.  If your expert provides functionality that uses the legal public documented OTA interfaces only, then moving to a DLL should be problem free.  If you use some back door hacks that are possible with BPLs, then I can't advise you further.

The Zeus editor has an semi-automatic ctags feature and it uses this tag information to drive it's go to definition and auto complete features.

Generally the auto complete works well enough for static languages but for dynamic languages like Java Script it really does not work very well.

What are your experiences with Scala tools currently used in production?

Given that Scala 2.8 has been out for over a month, I thought it would be a good time for an update on the status of Scala tooling, along the lines of these questions. I'd like to broaden the scope of the questions beyond IDEs, to include RAD tools (e.g. JRebel), build tools/compilers (sbt, Maven, fsc), and perhaps even frameworks (e.g. Lift, Play).

For my part, I've used both IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse with Maven. So far, my use has been limited to porting a production codebase from 2.7.7 to 2.8.  IDEA appears to be the leader of the two, although I had to upgrade to the EAP version of the IDE when I switched to 2.8. The Eclipse plugin still has many spurious compile errors in my codebase and is not at all responsive. On the other hand, at least one developer I know of had better luck with Eclipse than with IDEA.

Another concern I've had has been compilation speed. With Scala 2.7.7 at least, IDEA was incredibly slow -- it routinely took ~30 seconds to run a Make, even after a minor change. As a result, I started using fsc via the Maven plugin's scala:cc goal, which reduced typical incremental compile times to 3-5 seconds.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
For me, I tried Eclipse and sbt (simple-build-tool). Eclipse seems to be a little bit unreliable. It reports errors which aren't really errors. Eclipse also took so much RAM in my laptop, it's going to be very slow if you're using an old computer (or anything with low RAM). sbt is less power hungry, but it doesn't have live error checking that Eclipse has (which isn't really reliable anyway).

Anyway, I guess you should give both a try! I guess it depends on the project that you're doing.

There are plenty that support Perl of course, but when it comes to files with Mason and Perl intertwined the editors tend to get confused and highlight incorrectly.

Komodo IDEs (ver. 4 to 6) have Mason-support and
can handle Mason and HTML in the same document.
I wouldn't be suprised if the Komodo-Edit
has that also.

Title: Getting Unit Tests to work with Komodo IDE for Python
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've tried to run the following code on Komodo IDE (for python):

import unittest

class MathLibraryTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test1Plus1Equals2(self):
        self.assertEqual(1+1, 2)


Then, I created a new test plan, pointing to this project(file) directory and tried to run it the test plan. It seems to run but it doesn't seem to find any tests.

If I try to run the following code with the "regular" run command (F7)

class MathLibraryTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def testPlus1Equals2(self):
        self.assertEqual(1+1, 2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()


it works. I get the following output:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK


What might I be doing wrong?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
For the test file to be picked up the filename must start with test_. I tried using just test.py which failed, however test_.py works like a dream.

All you need to do is rename your file. This is not made very clear in the documentation - I worked it out via a bug report on Komodo's web site.

It would be nice if Komodo gave at least a clue to the problem!

You can use nib2cib, which is pretty much the same idea, but it uses interface builder (part of xcode) to create the interface, then translate the nib (or xib) to a cib.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Interface Builder + nib2cib is not in itself a workaround, though the use of an âexternal toolâ may make it seem so.  Actually by using a master set of .nib files, one may leverage IBâs great power (which Atlas is catching up with) and interchangeably use them between Cocoa apps and Cappuccino apps.  However, nib2cib looks for keys and values inside .nib files and there are a few classes that it still does not recognize.  You can provide new class definition files so nib2cib works with everything you use.

Interface Builder comes with XCode with many other tools included in Appleâs free Cocoa SDK.

Title: How do I declare MAX_DOUBLE in VB6?
Description: 
    
    
                    
According to the MSDN help for VB6


  Floating-point values can be expressed as mmmEeee or mmmDeee, in which mmm is the mantissa and eee is the exponent (a power of 10). The highest positive value of a Single data type is 3.402823E+38, or 3.4 times 10 to the 38th power; the highest positive value of a Double data type is 1.79769313486232D+308, or about 1.8 times 10 to the 308th power. Using D to separate the mantissa and exponent in a numeric literal causes the value to be treated as a Double data type. Likewise, using E in the same fashion treats the value as a Single data type.


Now in the VB6 IDE I've tried to enter this 

const MAX_DOUBLE as Double = 1.79769313486232D+308


however, as soon as I move away from that line the IDE throws an Error 6 (Overflow)


  An overflow results when you try to make an assignment that exceeds the limitations of the target of the assignment. ...


So how do I get MAX_DOUBLE (and MIN_DOUBLE for that matter) defined?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Does it have to be a Const? You can get the exact value of MAX_DOUBLE into a variable by setting the correct bit pattern using CopyMemory from a Byte array.

Private Declare Sub CopyMemory Lib "kernel32" Alias "RtlMoveMemory" (Destination As Any, Source As Any, ByVal Length As Long)

Dim Max As Double
Dim Idx As Long
Dim Bits(0 To 7) As Byte

For Idx = 0 To 5
   Bits(Idx) = 255
Next
Bits(6) = 239 ' = 11101111
Bits(7) = 127

For Idx = 0 To 7
   CopyMemory ByVal VarPtr(Max) + Idx, Bits(Idx), 1
Next

Debug.Print Max


Edit: I forgot that you also asked about MIN_DOUBLE, which is even easier.

Dim Min As Double
Dim Bits As Byte

Bits = 1
CopyMemory ByVal VarPtr(Min), Bits, 1

Debug.Print Min

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Edit:
Solved it!

Const test As Double = 1.79769313486231E+308 + 5.88768018655736E+293


Double checked it down to the binary level, that should be as high as you can go. You can keep adding values like 1 etc but it yields a number equal to, not greater than.
Output is this:
01111111|11101111|11111111|11111111|11111111|11111111|11111111|11111111
Which is indeed DoubleMax

Old:
You could just use Positive infinity.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Obvious pragmatic workaround: reduce the number slightly.

Const MAX_DOUBLE As Double = 1.79769313486231E+308


I imagine that'll be adequate in most situations.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Use an "E" for exponent in the number instead of a "D" like this below.

Public Const MAX_DOUBLE = 1.79769313486232E+308


[edit]

Take a look at this link below, scroll to the bottom. This concrete code example shows how this construct is being employed. Hopefully this helps.

Title: Better multi-threaded debugging in the Delphi
Description: 
    
    
                    
Leading on from the answer to another question about bugs in the Delphi IDE, does anyone know if there is a way to improve the multi-threaded debugging functionality of the IDE, or if not, at least why it is so bad on occasion?

When you have multiple threads within a program, stepping through the code with F7 or F8 can often lead to either very long pauses, or the whole IDE just locks ups. This is especially apparent when you leave or enter a method or procedure. The debugger always seems to be fine for single threaded applications.

PS. The version I'm using is 2007
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
From my experience multi threaded debugging is much nicer using Vista and Delphi 2009 than XP with Delphi 2007. 

First, the ide is significantly more stable.

Second, in Delphi 2009 on vista the debugger can show you where deadlocks are occurring.

If you have to use Delphi 2007, I would strongly recommend debugging your code in a single threaded unit test if possible, then using your by now tested code in the main program. ;) 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
When the application itself has not deadlocked, try to be very aware of which thread you're in. Keep the thread list up in the debugger, and consider using named threads.

There are times when it will be impossible to interactively debug an application which itself deadlocks. When this happens, you can use tools such as WinDbg and Adplus in order to work with memory dumps. Yes, this is a lot harder than using the interactive debugger, but it beats having no debugger at all. There are sample applications, demos, and instructions, on Tess Ferrandez's blog. I would start with this page. The labs are .NET-centric, but don't let that keep you away; the ideas are the same.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
When I want to debug a multithreaded operation I often use a log file (that I analyse after the application has run) instead of the interactive Debugger.

For example with the function 'OutputDebugString'. The output comes in the event log of Delphi. If you start your program outside of Delphi, you can use DebugView from SysInternals to display the log. Take care to add the Thread-ID to each output (GetCurrentThreadID).
Be aware that there could be a thread switch just before writing to the log. But at places where several threads interact you will probably have a critical session (or another synchronization object) so that it should be a problem.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Yes, debugging a multithreaded application is a hassle. Because you are constantly swapping from one thread to another.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Another Idea that I have never tried because I've just thought about it: if you are interested in debugging one thread and just want to avoid being disturbed by the other threads, it might be possible to suspend some threads temporaly.

Process Explorer from SysInternals offers a possibility to suspend and resume threads (in the tab called "Threads" in the properties of a process). But as I said I've never tested it until now.
    
    
Title: How to continue &ldquo;creating&rdquo; a commit after TODO review or jump to source in IntelliJ Idea?
Description: 
    
    
                    
This is getting very annoying so I assume I just do something wrong.

The problem: I spent some time carefully choosing what exactly to commit (git), writing the commit message, selecting the author. When I press commit and I get Before Commit hook/inspection that notifies me that I have some TODOs files about to be committed. Fine, I fix this and now what? I open commit menu (Ctrl+K) again, and nothing is saved apart from the message!
Same if I decide to jump to source for some file to apply some fix or to just examine it more closely.

There is definitely something wrong here, since I don't see how this can be though as productive and none other git tools/git cli behave like this.

Note that I'm not against pre-commit inspection (I know how to disable it). I want it. I just want to resume the commit from there I left off.

Edit: another similar situation - the commit failed for whatever reason. I'd like to just repeat it changing few small things. But Idea forgets about it. I need to go through whole process again.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Unfortunately, TODO/ Code analysis review from commit dialog closes the dialog and there is no way to continue it. There is a request to allow this - https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-126948, see also related.

However, commit message should be saved in the process. If it does not happen, there is probably some bug. List of selected files/chunk is not saved - see https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-106867 and related
    
    
Title: Disable categorization in &ldquo;method / event / enum dropdown browser&rdquo;
Description: 
    
    
                    


.

In VB6, the dropdown in the IDE shown above wasn't categorized.
I could easily browse "ucBoardGrid"'s events and properties as they were all shown in the same dropdown menu.

While VS2017 tries to organize things for me, I feel that it's mostly much more time-taking to browse where I want to:

First I need to select the "main category" in the left dropdown menu, then I can view the methods / events / properties in the right dropdown menu.

Is there a way to disable this categorization? I would like everything to be shown in a single dropdown list right away.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I fondly remember the old VB6 menu's just as you've explained. 


  I would like everything to be shown in a single dropdown list right away.


I doubt you can remove the categorization, however I have something far more amazing. These days I find myself using Ctrl+T.

The new Go to All window in Visual Studio 2017 lets you navigate directly to any file, type, member, line or symbol by typing a search query:



The main difference from the Navigate To window (existed since Visual Studio 2010) is that now you can easily limit search results to files, types, members or symbols clicking on the corresponding toolbar button. Alternatively, you can type the special character and space before the search query:



Works for Files (f), Types (t), Members (m), Symbols (#) and Lines (:),  e.g. f stac for file paths containing stac



Edit: Apart from Ctrl+T, I typically use F12 to goto definition. Then I use Ctrl+ minus key to go back, and back, F12 forward, and back, again. It's the fastest I've found.

I'm also a fan while debugging to pull up Ctrl+Alt+c the call stack, up/down arrow keys while focus is on CallStack window. 

F12 &amp; Ctrl+- is the key, anything else Ctrl+T.

There is issue which says - Strings literals should be placed on the left side when checking for equality. And count of this issue is 12k+. 

testFlag.equalsIgnoreCase("Y") - non-complaint
"Y".equalsIgnoreCase(testFlag) - complaint


I am trying to use Intelliji IDE Inspection utility to fix this using "Strutural Search Inspection". How ever, it did not work out.

I have kept search template as 

$instanceVariable$(equalsIgnoreCase)\(\"$StringLiteral$


and replace template as

$StringLiteral$(equalsIgnoreCase)\(\"$instanceVariable$


But it does not work, is it right way to do/ any better options available in intelliji for this.

I am open to other IDEs like Eclipse. So if there is an option in any open source IDEs, i could try out.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In Intellij you should be able to do this via the Analyze options.

Probably the easiest option being by Run Inspection by Name to limit the inspection to just the one



Then the inspection you want is  expression.equals("literal"), put this in the box that appears and select it, then choose your scope to run the inspection.

You can then fix each occurrence case by case or hit the flip equals button to do them all at once.


    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I used $Instance$.$MethodCall$("$Parameter$") as my search template and "$Parameter$".$MethodCall$($Instance$) as my replacement template.  Under Edit Variables, you can choose MethodCall on the left and under Text Constraints, enter equalsIgnoreCase in the Text/regexp box.

But I can't find a way to search with namespace by this way. CamelCase seems to work only on the class name.

I have a project with a lot class with the same name in different namespace and I need to search the class in the list and since PhpStorm change the order depending on context, It's clearly take few seconds to find the good one.

I've the same result with Navigate &gt; Class ... and new magic shortcut 2 x Shift

Is there is any tips that allow to search by namespace ? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Sure, just separate namespace part from class name using \ character.



Lets assume we have 2 similarly named classes in different namespaces (just an example):

App\Controller\Search
App\Model\Search


To see only 1st entry -- you will have to type c\se; to see only 2nd -- m\se.

I'm assuming your keyboard buffer contains only text.

If so, and you are not getting this error when editing other files, and/or files in other solutions - this may be due to the particular file having some form of "corruption".

It might be related to a code editor, which is being used for the current file. Try right clicking the file in Solution explorer and select "Open with" and then select the desired code editor.

Title: Eclipse search everywhere
Description: 
    
    
                    
There is a search everywhere shortcut in Intellij IDEA(double clicking shift button), I'm wondering if similiar searching can be done in Eclipse. I did some googling, but it seems I can't search files/code at the same time in Eclipse.

Any suggestions are appreciated.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
No, the search everywhere (source code, databases, actions, elements of the user interface) from IntelliJ is (for Eclipse) split at least between:


searches (ctrl+H): you can define a search in files by default.
searches in shortcuts (ctrl+l): for dearching the list of key bindings

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
For me, its a combination of:

Cmd+Shift+R : using wildcards like *, for the files
Cmd+Shift+M : for methods (also Cmd+O for a quick outline)
Cmd+Shift+T : for classes

I prefer keyboard shortcuts rather than the mouse, so these 3 shortcuts helps me a lot
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Control + 3 - search in all the settings. And my favourite Control + Shift + L (Only in Spring Source Tool Suite) - it's like Google for your source code. Is somehow similar to Symbol/ctag search in Intellij but it finds ALL occurences.

Both are very old features.

Instead of generating a full class name (namespace+class name) I want Netbeans to add a use statement and a simple class name, this will add:
use \Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager; 

before my class declaration and the generated code will be:
$d = new EntityManager($conn, $config, $eventManager)

Anyone could advise how to achieve this?

IMHO not possible now, there is some enhancement in NetBeans' bugzilla. The "workaround" is to let NetBeans insert FQN and then press Ctrl+Shift+I to fix namespaces, this will remove FQN and insert use statements.
    
    
Title: STS(Spring Tool Suite) and Eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
Now I am trying to learn about Spring step-by-step and read Pro Spring 3 ebook. In this book, the author describes STS. Now I am using with Eclipse IDE and I would like to know about Spring Tool Suite (STS).

1). What are the benefits of using it rather than Eclipse IDE
2). Have there any special features for Spring on it? 
3). Is the same Extensions tab of Dashboard on STS and Eclipse market-place?

Please describes to me some useful tips (if has pros and cons) on each.

Thanks in advance!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
STS is just a preconfigured eclipse. it is completely free for any purpose.

The pros and cons using STS go hand in hand: it has some plugines preinstalled which might be usefull or simply slow your IDE down. It has stuff you might need and don't need to download but i might has stuff you won't need. as far as i know, you can install all plug-ins that STS has in your eclipse.

I find it easier to set up a spring based project with STS. But if you are developing on an existing project it doesn't matter if you use STS or eclipse.

It depends on what you want.

Title: Delphi XE2 prompted me that file date/time has changed, but it didn&#39;t. Should I be worried?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have left my Delphi IDE open on my work computer overnight with a project open. Just now, I connected to my work computer via Windows Remote Desktop, and was prompted...

Module [file path.pas]'s time/date changed. Reload?


The same message appeared for each and every file in the project which was open.

Should I be worried about this? Did anything really change? I checked the source and nothing is different.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It just so happens that Daylight Savings Time has just ended, where all areas which observe it have just gone back an hour in time. The Delphi IDE does not know this, and therefore the date/time of all the files open will be an hour different from reality.

I expect that a lot of people will be seeing this today or tomorrow, or whenever they get back to their IDE which was left open during the time change.
    
    
Title: Local editors in HTML5
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am wondering if the current state of HTML5 makes it possible to edit local files.
More precisely, I mean :


The files are not served by a server (they are on file://), or in the worst case, a local server
The editor is either on the local filesystem, or served by an external server
It would be better if I don't use a browser extension
The overall goal is to create an online IDE which does not require page reload or manual file inserts


I know there is the fileSystem API but from what I read it seems to be for chrome extensions only ? And what about listening to file changes ?

I also noticed on trace.gl that it is possible to create links that open the local text editor once clicked (like in the chrome console).

Is it achievable to reproduce what we can see on trace.glbut coupled with access to the local file system, and listening to file changes events, with the goal of creating some sort of local IDE ?

Edit for more precision : The goal is really to create an IDE. Think for exemple of code IDE (Eclipse...) that shows each files and directory from a workspace, and listen to changes, can read/write in real time, etc. This is what I would like to achieve.
PS : It may be browser specific if needed
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

  I am wondering if the current state of HTML5 makes it possible to edit
  local files


Yes and no. The HTML5 File System API spec is implemented in all the latest browsers (IE10, iOS6, Chrome, Safari, Firefox). However it doesn't give you full access to the users local filesystem. To quote the spec:


  This specification defines an API to navigate file system hierarchies,
  and defines a means by which a user agent may expose sandboxed
  sections of a user's local filesystem to web applications.


They keyword which prevents you doing what you're wanting to achieve is "sandboxed". Under the covers, when you use the HTML5 file system API it will create a brand new directory for the current page to use.

This may allow you to achieve what you want, if you're happy with your page having it's own sanboxed directory, however if you're creating an IDE I suspect you want a little bit more control than this.

IDE's in the browser

There already in fact browser based IDE's doing similar things to what you're asking:


Cloud9 - https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9/ - This works by kicking off a Node.js webserver and being pointed to a directory which has your project in it. The files are then served up to the browser by this browser.
Orion - http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/How_Tos/Install_Orion_on_Localhost - This is an Eclipse based project which again works by kicking off a local web server and serving the files up to the browser.


My advice would be start by looking at their code bases - both are open source and in a pretty stable state. You could either branch one of them to achieve your aims, or use them for ideas for how to get started on your own.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
According to HTML5 Rocks, the File ReaderAPI is implemented in recent versions of major browsers, and the File System &amp; File Writer APIs are implemented in both Chrome and Opera. More information on leveraging this API is available in this Filesystem API tutorial.

From my understanding of the Working Draft it is not possible to watch for file changes.

If you're not strictly limited to HTML5, you may want to look into how TiddlyWiki manages to save files locally using a Java applet, look into the Dropbox Datastore API which leverages Dropbox as a sort of database, or the Dropbox Saver Drop-in.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If you are using a Mac, you can tell the browser to open a webpage locally saved as if it was on a server. Since Mac OS X ships with Apache, you can use http:// instead of file:/// and it will open with the Apache web server instead of just viewing a file. This will load it like it is on a remote server. You can use any text editor or IDE, as long as it is saving to the local filesystem. This is not browser-specific. To load new edits, just save the page &amp; refresh the browser.

Hope this helps!
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
There is something called Workspaces in Chrome Canary (at time of writing) that allows you to map pages to files on disk so that changes are persisted. Otherwise you may need to serve the local files through a webserver and then post the updates to the webserver where they can be written.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Not really HTML5 APIs. But there are some browser-specific solutions.

E.g., in IE you can achieve that via ActiveX and FileSystemObject:

Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set a = fs.CreateTextFile("c:\testfile.txt", True)
a.WriteLine("This is a test.")
a.Close


In FF this can be done with XPCOM components.
For other browsers JAVA applets can be used.

You can also take a look a the twFile jquery plugin (basically the wrapper for the methods above).

then, you will see aspect affected methods.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Yes, it is shown as you can see from @XiujunMa answer. It also works in 11.1.3. Used to navigate to the transaction affected methods in Spring.


  To be able to use the AspectJ support in IntelliJ IDEA, you have to
  make sure that the following plugins are enabled:

Spring-AOP and @AspectJ Support.
AspectJ Support.

  
  In addition to that, you should also create a library for
  aspectjrt.jar.


You probably need to use &lt;aop:config&gt; in the spring configuration to define &lt;aop:pointcut. Then use &lt;aop:advisor to map that pointcut and advice reference. You could also put the &lt;aop:aspect there.
    
    
Title: IDE expecting file to be in different location
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a component package in Delphi XE2 version 16.0.4429.46931, both a run-time and design-time package together. This package has existed for over a year, and the file/folder structure has always been the same. I keep all the units in a dedicated Source folder from the root, and the actual packages in a Packages folder in the same root. So the packages are found in \Root\Packages\ and units are found in \Root\Source\.

Today, after building the run-time package, I was going through the hints and warnings. One of the warnings was this:

[DCC Warning] Inno.TimeChart.pas(1): W1025 Unsupported language feature: 'class constructor'


The warning its self is not what worries me. The problem is when I double-click this warning, I get an error message from the IDE:



The one thing which I immediately noticed was that it is not looking in the Source folder, but rather directly in the Packages folder. Somehow, the IDE is expecting that the unit be in the same location as the package. Ever since I created the package over a year ago, I have never changed any of the library paths, locations of files, or structure of the package.

The file does exist, but in a different place than it appears to be looking. The file has never been saved in the folder with the projects, and in fact nothing other than the package projects themselves have ever been saved in the Packages folder. This all resides in the Source folder, but the IDE seems to think otherwise.

Why would the IDE think this file is in a different folder? All the other hints and warnings related to the same unit work just fine when I double-click them, but not this one.

EDIT

I've created a new test package to troubleshoot this issue.

Root\TestPackage.dpr
Root\Source\TestPackageUnit.pas


The specific piece of code which is causing this compiler warning is in this class:

type
  TMyComponent = class(TComponent)
  strict private
    class constructor Create;
  end;


When I compile, using Process Monitor, I see the IDE is searching in 30+ different places for this file (of course failing), it looks like it's searching in every library path, rather than in the one place the package says it's at.

Things I've Tried


Verified there is no difference between these paths between the DPR and DPROJ files
Installed all the latest updates and the IDE FixPack (actually gave me new problems)
Monitored file's access with Process Monitor


Filters: process name equals BDS.exe; Path ends with TestPackageUnit.pas
Result: "NAME NOT FOUND" --/li/ol/lili/lili/lili/lili/lili/lilicode/code/lili/lili/lilicode/codecode/codecode/code/li/ol/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
I do run into such problems when the delphi search path list is too long. I could always help myself in moving the relevant directories more to the front, i.e. up in the list. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Check that the file has not been added to the project file (dpr or dpk). Project - View Source will display the file. 

If this isn't the case, try searching all the files in your project for the file name and see what turns up.

Title: How do I modify Indy 8 IdMessage.pas with Delphi 6?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a copy of Delphi 6 and a simple email program that uses the Indy TIdMessage component.  I want to remove lines 464-465 of IdMessage.pas then recompile the application.  I'm having a hard time finding clear documentation, so I tried these steps to modify the component:


opened \delphi6\source\indy\indy.dpk in the IDE
double-clicked IdMessage.pas in the Package window
edited IdMessage.pas and saved the file
clicked "Compile" in the Package window
clicked "Build Indy" in the Project menu
clicked "Install" in the Package window


But then I get an error that \bpl\indy60.bpl can't be loaded because \bin\indy60.bpl is already loaded.  So I tried "Install packages..." in the Components menu, but only found \bpl\dclindy60.bpl there.  So I removed that package, and:


opened \delphi6\source\indy\dclindy.dpk in the IDE
clicked "Compile" in the Package window
clicked "Build dclIndy" in the Project menu
clicked "Install" in the Package window


The IDE confirmed all the components (including TIdMessage) were installed, but the email program is still acting as though the original unmodified component is still being used.

What am I doing wrong?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
if you were using runtime packages then you'd need to ensure that your program found the new package file, the .bpl. 

But you probably are not using runtime packages. So the runtime program statically links the Indy code using .dcu files located in the Delphi installation folders. Specifically in this case to &lt;ProgramFiles&gt;\Borland\Delphi6\Lib\IdMessage.dcu. You need to make sure you link the new code. The easiest way is to add the modified file to your project. That will mean that the modified version gets compiled and linked into your program. 

Since your modifications are in the implementation section of the unit this is all you need to do. If the modifications were in the interface section you'll encounter "Unit X was compiled with a different version of Unit Y" errors. You'd solve that by adding the rest of the Indy source to your project.

One point to stress is that you should never modify the files under the Delphi installation folder. If you want to build modifications to those components, take copies of the files and make modifications in those copies.

Title: Visual Studio 2010 Improperly underlining code/comments with red error line when there is no error
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am working on a rather large project, and I am having strange problems with the IDE in terms of error checking and somewhat with IntelliSense.

Usually if I were to type something boneheaded, like "int a = "aa";", it would underline "aa" in red. However I am seeing VS do this to random parts of my code when I make insignificant changes.

For example:

/*
     Some comment here, just going to stretch it out for my example..
*/

int proto1();
int proto2();


If I make changes to other parts of the project, sometimes random functions will get underlined, and even part of a comment. Like just 30 minutes ago it underlined the equivalent of half of that comment beginning in the middle of the word "comment", also it underlined all of int proto1(); and part of int proto2();

I would post screenshots but I am bound by contract not to disclose any work, and I can't easily replicate it in smaller projects.

I don't understand why it does this. When I compile the project, any fake errors and underlining it did goes away and it compiles fine. The point though, is there are no errors. It's making up random errors and underlining random lines/words/half words. I would also like to note that there seems to be a large delay in loading new intellisense information, almost by 2-3 minutes or longer.

I'll try and reproduce it in an unrelated project and post here if I can. However, any help would be appreciated.

Thanks!

I just had this same issue. I tried many of the solutions outlined here and elsewhere. I finally tried running Visual Studio as another user (Shift Right Click Run As Different User) and the issue did not present. I then logged into my computer as another user and deleted the profile of the user I was having the issue with. 

If your profile is important to you or there is information within it that is important I highly recommend backing up relevant information first. If you don't understand what information you profile contains make sure you do prior to deleting it.

1) Log in as different user (with admin privileges) than you want to delete

2) Open Properties for Computer

3) Advanced system settings (on the left side)

4) Settings for User Profiles (in the middle)

5) Select the profile you want to delete and click the delete button

6) Reboot

EDIT

While looking for something completely unrelated in TagList's help I've just found these two functions:

Tlist_Get_Tagname_By_Line()
Tlist_Get_Tag_Prototype_By_Line()


Adding this in my statusbar works beautifully:

%{Tlist_Get_Tagname_By_Line()}


Also, did you read the Vim Wiki? It has a bunch of tips trying to adress the same need. There is also this (untested) plugin.

If you are short on vertical space maybe you won't mind using a bit of horizontal space?

TagList and TagBar both show a vertical list of the tags used in the current buffer (and other opened documents in TagList's case) that you can use to navigate your code.

However, I'm not particularly a fan of having all sorts of informations (list of files, VCS status, list of tags, list of buffers/tabsâ¦) displayed at all times: being able to read the name of the function you are in is only useful when you actually need to know it, otherwise it's clutter. Vim's own [{ followed by &lt;C-o&gt; are enough for me.

I don't know anything about PHP, and I'm not trying to step on anyone's toes, but having looked at some PHP code I came up with this function which I think takes a simpler approach than the plugins that have been mentioned.

My assumpmtion is that PHP functions are declared using the syntax function MyFunction(){} and classes declared using class MyClass{} (possibly preceded by public). The following function searches backwards from the cursor position to find the most recently declared class or function (and sets startline). Then we search forward for the first {, and find the matching }, setting endline. If the starting cursor line is inbetween startline and endline, we return the startline text. Otherwise we return an empty string.

function! PHP_Cursor_Position()
    let pos = getpos(".")
    let curline = pos[1]
    let win = winsaveview()
    let decl = ""
    let startline = search('^\s*\(public\)\=\s*\(function\|class\)\s*\w\+','cbW')
    call search('{','cW')
    sil exe "normal %"
    let endline = line(".")
    if curline &gt;= startline &amp;&amp; curline &lt;= endline
        let decl = getline(startline)
    endif
    call cursor(pos)
    call winrestview(win)
    return decl
endfunction

set statusline=%{PHP_Cursor_Position()}


Because it returns nothing when it is outside a function/class, it does not display erroneous code on the statusline, as the suggested plugin does.

Of course, I may well be oversimplifying the problem, in which case ignore me, but this seems like a sensible approach.

Is it possible to set a "rollback point" in any Java IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans, IDEA), so that I can quickly get back to it if I don't like the change without going through the millions of Undo's? 

I know that there's a best practice branch-commit quickly-merge, but that's not appropriate in current environment.

Eclipse

Eclipse keeps a local history of a file. Right-click in the file and choose Compare With -/pp/pp

NetBeans has a local file history which acts similar to a versioning system. You can "rollback" your changes to a specific version of the file.

In Eclipse, I think the Local History could help
