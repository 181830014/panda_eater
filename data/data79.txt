Title: Dynamic doc blocks for type hinting and autocomplete with dynamic output classes
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a medium-sized MVC application.  The use cases for the app are such that I require a bit more control of the SQL used to interact with my database (among other things, data is highly normalized and we use a LOT of joins).  So, I've grown my own design for models, rather than using Doctrine or Eloquent or anything.  I recently discovered my design is called the Table Data Gateway pattern.  At any rate, it looks like this (simplified a bit for clarity):

We have an an abstract class which all my TableGateways extend.  It knows how to talk to PDO and do SQL stuff, but not about any particular table:

abstract class TableGateway {

    protected $db = null;

    public $tableName = '';

    public $outputClass = null;

    function __contruct(\PDO $pdo) {
        $this-&gt;db = $pdo;
    }

    /**
     * $return \StdClass[]
     */
    function all() {
        $result = $this-&gt;query(sprintf('SELECT * FROM %s',$this-&gt;tableName));
        return $result;
    }

    /**
     * @param $query
     * @param array $params
     * @return \StdClass[]
     */
    public function query($query, $params = array()) {
        $stmt = $this-&gt;db-&gt;prepare($query);
        if($this-&gt;outputClass) {
            $stmt-&gt;setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_CLASS, $this-&gt;outputClass);
        } else {
            $stmt-&gt;setFetchMode(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);
        }
        $success = $stmt-&gt;execute($params);
        return $stmt-&gt;fetchAll();
    }
}


Then each table has a gateway class which extends the parent class and applies the table-specific stuff.  There will be a lot of functions in here which call $this-&gt;query(), bringing their knowledge of the table's structure to build a useful query, but there are also some basic functions, like PostsGateway::all() which are the same for every table, so they live in the parent class.

class PostsGateway extends TableGateway {
    public $tableName = 'posts';

    public $outputClass = 'Post';
}


Each result from the query is loaded into an object.  By default they are just StdClass objects, but you can specify an alternate $this-&gt;outputClass to have them output in that other class, like this one:

class Post {
    /** @var int $id */
    /** @var string $content */
}


All this is working pretty well for me.  However, my IDE can't keep up.  You and I know that PostsGateway::all() is going to return an array Post objects, but the IDE thinks it's just a regular array.  This means I don't autocomplete hints for the properties of the Post objects.

Does anyone know any clever ways to resolve this, so the IDE will know about the change?

I was thinking about a script to automatically generate doc blocks for PostsGateway, but I'm a little leary of code gen in general, and especially code gen in a class I'm going to modify periodically.  The script would have to periodically update the doc blocks, based on changes to TableGateway, and not mess up anything I've added to PostsGateway.

Are there any other cool ways to do get around this?  Or can you recommend some good libraries for generating this code blocks?

Title: Delphi IDE profiling while debugging; can we time F7, F8 stepping?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using Delphi XE6.  Often while stepping through code i'd like to trace where the CPU is being used, at least approximately.  

I have AQtime but have been unable to get it running with my (large) application without getting lots of errors, and it seems overly complex for what i need.

My thought is that it would be very nice if the IDE ran a timer when executing my program , and could give me deltas whenever it pauses (whether by breakpoint, F4, F7 or F8).  Through judicious use of this I should get a good idea of which functions etc in my code need speed improvement.  I do this now approximately by judging where a slowdown is, but if its in a function called a zillion times taking a couple of ms my judgement fails me, eg:

   for i := 1 to 1000 do
    begin
      fastfunction1;  // takes 1ms
      fastfunction2;  // takes 1ms
      slowfunction;   // takes 20ms!!!  If I was able to see this while stepping over it...
      fastfunction3;  // takes 1ms
    end;


Has anyone seen a plugin for the IDE that might do this?  Or would it be hard to write one?

Thanks,
Chris
    

        
Title: Multiple separated development environments on Windows?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Since I develop on different projects which require different settings and different kinds of plugins with specific settings, is there any way I can use different idea.properties files without renaming them every time or duplicating the whole IDE?

For example I pass the specific config as parameter like 
idea64.exe -config="environtment1.properties" which leads to C:\project1\config
idea64.exe -config="environtment2.properties" which leads to C:\project2\config

Is something similar possible with NPM? Because I often encounter problems which are caused from other packages which I don't even use, or I need different versions of the package for each project, so it would be great if I could start with a completely fresh environment every time I create a new workspace.

The only thing I could think of are virtual machines, but that wouldn't be very performant and each VM would create overhead and setting up a new VM, even from a snapshot is crazly annyoing... But that would be a way to separate each project.

Second thing would be duplicating the applications which I already mentioned, but this would take about 1GB and more per project only for the apps.

I can't come up with a clean solution, I'd like to set different config folders per app but if the software doesn't support passing a new config path through a parameter I'm pretty much screwed.

Someone got an idea how to solve my first world problems?

I am using Windows by the way.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The "Edit with IDLE" option is actually placed there by IDLE itself. The thing you could do is just change the default program you want python files to be opened with (by right clicking, choosing "Open with" and choose a default program).

The additional entries in the context menus are specified in the registry. So i think if you want to manually add a "Edit with PyCharm" option you would have to edit the registry yourself. But I wouldn't recommend to do that at all.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Assuming you have Windows 7/8 and have the program (in this case PyCharm) installed already, you would:


Right click any python file (typically ending with .py) 
Click "Open With" 
Either select PyCharm or the desired program from the list of programs OR
Click Choose Default Program and 'find more options' or 'choose program from list' and find PyCharm in the directory you installed it in and select program


Hope this helps! Be sure to specify if you meant a different OS than Widows.

"Customize Window"
"Filters"


Click the one you find, and you will get a checkboxes list with "Non Java-Elements" option. Toggle it and it works.

In case of C/C++ project, the entry is called  "Non C-Objects".

I don't know how to do exactly what you ask using RubyMine's code completion. However,


If you type SomeClass.so and type control-space twice, RubyMine will offer to complete using all declared names, whether they're in your code or in gems. (If the autocomplete popup is already showing, you just have to type control-space once.)
You can see all the declared names that RubyMine knows about by typing option-command-O twice and typing the start of the name you're looking for. (That key combo is on the MacOS X 10.5+ keymap; on other keymaps use whatever Navigate -/p/lilipcode/code/p/li/ul/div

There are no Linux platform packages for STS (as far as I know). It is designed to be executed as an app with user privileges, so there isn't really a lot of benefit in having a formal package for it. Just unzip the distro and run it.
