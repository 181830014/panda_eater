Title: Online IDE that you can share a private url for invitees to view
Description: 
    
    
                    
I thought for sure this would be a normal thing, but while reading about Nitrous, Koding, Codio, etc, I couldn't quite find it. 

I want to build a site in an online IDE and share a private url with people to use it. I don't want the public to see it, only those that I invite via email or authentication or ???

I thought Codio did it, but it says that no-one can see a private url. And everyone can see a public url. Not what I want.

You can set http basic auth on rails and django applications on Nitrous. 

Here's a detailed article explaining how to set http basic auth on a Rails and Django application: 

https://community.nitrous.io/docs/setting-up-basic-auth-on-nitrous-preview-urls

Example Rails controller code: 



class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
   http_basic_authenticate_with name: "foo", password: "bar", except: :index

   def index
     render text: "This text can be seen by everyone."
   end

   def edit
     render text: "You can only view this if you know the username and password."
   end
end

    
    
Title: Can you create a GUI in Eclipse?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am learning Java and my IDE is Eclipse Mars. I was wondering if there was a way to create a GUI in Eclipse?

I researched it and the only half decent way I can find was pretty complex, any ideas?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Eclipse includes WindowBuilder, a "bi-directional Java GUI designer." Whether you have it installed in your Eclipse depends on which package you downloaded; if you downloaded Eclipse IDE for Java Developers then it's already included. If you got a different package, you can install WindowBuilder via these instructions.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Eclipse itself has only the coding function when it comes to GUIs. 

If you really want to know your way around GUIs I recommend you learn it by programming it.

If you just want to try it out one time or start with easier lessons and then go into programming it yourself I recommend the IDE "Netbeans". It has a drag-and-drop kinda GUI builder implemented with which GUIs are very easy to implement. 

Especially if your are just learning Java I recommend learning the basics in Java first, insert your functions into an easy to build GUI with Netbeans and later on go into fully programming GUIs. 

Netbeans is also free and pretty much the same as eclipse. Maybe less customizable features, but for beginners and people who want to know how GUI works its perfect.

I just upgraded to Windows 10 and noticed that some programs, such as Visual Studio 2010, start a setup when I try to run them and look for their install files. What really makes me wonder though is that this VS2010 setup also starts when I run the VB6 IDE. How can these two be connected?

For whatever reason / somehow you have injected custom language (HTML?) into DIV (?) tags (the green background).

Settings (Preferences on Mac) | Editor | Language Injections -- find and delete offending rule. It should have "Project" or "Global" in most right column (Scope) -- do not touch "Bundled" ones.

Alternatively -- Alt + Enter while having caret inside problematic place and choose "Uninject xxx" from popup menu. This will only disable that rule (which is still enough to make it work as before) .. but you better delete such wrong rule at some point later.

Does anybody knows an editor or an easy way to accomplish this:

class A{

public function __construct($a){
      //Do something 
    }

}

Class B extends A{

public function __construct($a,$b){
         parent::__construct($a);

Let's suppose I've update the __construct in the A class, adding a second parameter.

class A{

    public function __construct($a,$c){
          //Do something 
        }

    }


Is there any IDE that will automatically update all childs from my A class in order to update the __construct method?

Class B extends A{

This may be a fairly simple answer, or relatively easy; though I haven't been able to find the correct command/way to do so from anywhere.

As the title states, I'm trying to figure out the way as to space multiple lines of code.

Here's an example of what I'm looking for:

testing = "Testing"
work = "Work"
answer = "Answer"


Now I'd like to add spaces to the first two lines (selected together) at the same time, as in:

    testing = "Testing"
    work = "Work"
answer = "Answer"

Hold CTRL and click at the beginning of each line.

This will create two cursor points and every command will be iterated at every point.

Another tip:

You can highlight a selection of text, and CTRL + D will highlight all matches for that text and activate a cursor next to it. Very useful for mass editing in things like tables or forms.

Description: 
    
    
                    
In IntelliJ there is the option of linking IntelliJ-files with Eclipse-files.

IntelliJ provides out of the box interoperability with eclipse projects. When you select "linking IntelliJ-files with Eclipse-files" intelliJ stores dependencies in eclipse format (.classpath) so any changes you made in the project can also be seen by eclipse.

Title: Is it a bad idea to copy project folders for backup? Add existing items instead?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm learning C# (self-teaching first real programming language other than VBA).

Consistently, my text book asks me to create new project and add a bunch of existing items from an old project when I don't want to mess up my existing project. This seems to be their way of creating a backup. They never really said not to just copy folders so I've been doing that and it works fine.

The IDE doesn't allow you to save a whole project with a new name (i.e. Save As: "BACKUP Of projectName") so instead I close the IDE and just copy the folder. It's been a great time saver rather than following their laborious instructions but I fear that I'm teaching myself a bad habit. Please tell me my fears are unfounded.

It sounds like my practice won't blow anything up but there's a better way: a "Version Control System" or "VCS". I'm going to have to do a little research and pick one before my semi-bad habit gets too ingrained.

Title: Intellij project opening directory above project
Description: 
    
    
                    
I feel kind of silly asking this but I've been poking around and I don't know what is causing it. I have a directory structure that has a number of projects in it, it looks like this:


projects_root/project1
projects_root/project2
projects_root/project3


When I open any of these projects with Intellij it instead opens up the projects_root directory, so that all the projects in the directory are opened under my project tab. This is annoying as it clutters up my project view and it's causing some issues with my debug configurations etc. The strange thing is this was working fine until yesterday, that is opening project1 would open at the root of project1 instead of projects_root. I've changed no settings, the behaviour seemed to just start out of the blue. Has anyone seen behaviour like this before? Could anyone recommend a fix for this? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It appears that the content root of your IntelliJ project is incorrect. I can't tell you the cause for why this happened but you should be able to fix the content roots without needing to recreate each of the projects.

For each project, open up the respective IntelliJ project and follow the steps for removing a content root for all of the non-applicable content. E.g., for project1 remove projects_root/project2 and projects_root/project3.

Under "Inspections" in the Settings configuration, you can change your inspections profile to exclude the ones you don't want. Also, at the bottom right of the application window you can click on the "little guy in the hat" and turn down the inspections on a file-by-file basis.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Suppressing inspection in general may not be good idea.  You could create multiple custom profiles and keep it as part of project.  Create a new one called "minimum", which will have inspection that is meaningful to full team. Set that as default for project

Create another which will have much bigger set and run occasionally else where.

Am I able to use Jubula to test the entire Eclipse IDE? 

What I want to achieve is that let Jubula to automatically detect the actions performed in the Eclipse IDE such as "right click a project and rename the selected project". Therefore, I am able to reuse these recorded actions for my test purpose.

If it is possible, which Toolkit (rcp, swing, swt etc.) should I use for this? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Of course, it's possible.

You need to use the RCP toolkit and set eclipse.exe (or whichever your system binary is) as the AUT.

You don't want workspaces to collide: You can use the Jubula standalone or you need to run two instances of Eclipse. When you execute a Test Job, it will start the (or seek for a running) instance of the Eclipse. Thus you need two workspace folders; one for Jubula/Eclipse executing the tests, another for the Eclipse being tested.

You can use the Observation mode to detect the actions you perform. It's disadvantage is that this way your tests will be less reusable and harder to modify. If there's a change in the actions, then you better record the whole process again.

Or you can create your tests manually by adding Test Cases and controller mappings. This requires more practice/time.

If you don't want to spend much time with it then just use the Observation mode.

I've recently started using Netbeans for a java project and there are some things that I relly miss from Eclipse.

The thing that annoys me most, causing a great deal of frustration and loss of focus, is file navigation.

A very common task is to open another file in the same directory/package as the file I am currently editing. In Eclipse I use the little "Link with Editor" button in the project explorer so that the explorer is always focused on the current file, hence allowing easy access to other files in the same folder.

In Netbeans I constantly scroll up and down the project list, opening and closing folders, looking for the right place.

Is there a simple way to synchronize the project explorer with the editor in Netbeans?

I want to be able to choose the file from a list, because in many cases I don't know the file name by heart.

Answer 1: 

    
    
You can just write the code query:

from m in Application.Methods
where m.IsExtensionMethod
select m


For a code query that group extension method sby types extended see:

Title: QtCreator fails to parse msbuild compile errors/warnings
Description: 
    
    
                    
When I try to use QtCreator 3.3.2 to build a Visual Studio 2013 project, it does not put the errors and warnings in to the 'Issues' panel. They are visible in the compile output but unclickable. Here are the steps I have taken to reproduce this issue with a trivial example.

First I made a basic Win32 console application in Visual Studio and added a line to the _tmain function:

int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
   deliberately_missing_function(5);
   std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}


Visual Studio reports a compilation error with deliberately_missing_function, as expected.

I create a new QtCreator project using the "Import Existing Project" template and save it in the same directory as the Visual Studio solution file. In the project settings, I make a custom process step in the build, and fill the command as C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\12.0\Bin\MSBuild.exe and arguments as /p:Platform=Win32

When building, the compile output shows:

(snip)
Build FAILED.

"C:\Users\Portponky\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\Test\Test.sln" (default target) (1) -&gt;
"C:\Users\Portponky\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\Test\Test\Test.vcxproj" (default target) (2) -&gt;
(ClCompile target) -&gt; 
  c:\users\Portponky\documents\visual studio 2013\projects\test\test\test.cpp(9): error C3861: 'deliberately_missing_function': identifier not found [C:\Users\Portponky\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\Test\Test\Test.vcxproj]

    0 Warning(s)
    1 Error(s)


This is not picked up and shown in the Issues panel. My QtCreator is configured with the right compiler set up in the 'kits' section of options. I know that QtCreator is supposed to support reading msbuild errors, but I am confused as it doesn't seem to work at all.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I believe it is caused because the default error/warning parser for QtCreator as of 3.3.2 does not accept errors of the form:

path/to/file.cpp(123): Error: blah blah blah


It only accepts:

path/to/file.cpp(123) : Error: blah blah blah


The key difference is the space between the closing line number parenthesis. I deduced this by adding a custom build step in Visual Studio to echo fake error messages to the console and seeing which ones QtCreator picked up.

To solve this, I created an batch file called msbuild_wrapper.bat which used sed.exe from Cygwin:

@"C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\12.0\Bin\MSBuild.exe" %* | c:\cygwin64\bin\sed.exe 's/):/) :/g'


It simply runs msbuild with the given parameters and then uses sed to replace all incidences of "):" with ") :" in the output. In my project settings in QtCreator, I set the compiler to msbuild_wrapper.bat and also added /clp:NoSummary to the arguments to stop errors appearing twice.

Once that was in place, QtCreator correctly picks up all errors and warnings and places them in the 'Issues' panel with the correct file and line numbers.

Title: Should I use Intellij IDEA 14 Ultimate or Android Studio in that special case?
Description: 
    
    
                    
As an eclipse user, I am very new to Intellij and also to Android Studio and now I will start developing an app that will be comunicating with a JAX-RS Webservice.
So I wanna know your opinion, shoud I start the development using Android Studio or just stick with the regular Intellij IDEA Ultimate? What are the benefits of each case? What will I be missing? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate has some additional code insight support for JAX-RS which is not available in Android Studio, and it does include the Android development features from Android Studio. So if you already have an IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate license, I would recommend to just keep using it.
    
    
Title: Resolve Anaconda/iPython Notebooks/Spyder IDE launch failure on zmq lib import?
Description: 
    
    
                    
This is a fresh Anaconda 2.1 install on Windows 7 - 64, python 2.7.8 . The Spyder IDE fails to launch, and throws the same error/writes same traceback when python spyder --reset is run from cli. Looking at the traceback, it appears to be a problem loading zmq module. That module's \__init__.py looks for any precompiled libzmq file with one of these exts: pyd, so, dll, dylib, and adds them to list bundled, and then tries to load bundled[0].

bundled = []
bundled_sodium = []
for ext in ('pyd', 'so', 'dll', 'dylib'):
    bundled_sodium.extend(glob.glob(os.path.join(here, 'libsodium*.%s*' % ext)))
    bundled.extend(glob.glob(os.path.join(here, 'libzmq*.%s*' % ext)))


The confusing thing is that libzmq.pyd is located right in the Anaconda2.1\Lib\site-packages\zmq directory! After looking both at code and at the other questions on SO, I'm stumped. Please help.

You are picking up an install of Python in C:\Python27 somehow. Do you have the PYTHONPATH environment variable set?  If so, unset it.

The easiest solution is to just delete or set aside C:\Python27.
    
    
Title: How does an ide compile code?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Thinking about NetBeans or Eclipse I was wondering how an IDE compiles code when you click run. Does it open a command line in the background to compile it? How exactly does it work?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Each IDE will have it's own approach for how they actually achieve compilation. Usually they will have their own compilers or wrappers around existing compilers to which they delegate actual compilation.

Eclipse comes with a built in compiler of its own:

How does Eclipse compile classes with only a JRE?

I don't actually personally know much about how other ones achieve the compilation in any detail; somebody else may provide a better answer in that regard.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
IDEs use compilers. That's actually the difference between them.
For instance,  Code::Blocks uses MinGW Compiler which is a port of the GCC set of compilers.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Every compiler has its own method, some use their own wrappers and ports for known compilers. (See Codeblocks) 
I also noticed that some basic IDEs out there, just run the simple command line using gcc, clang, etc and let you pass parameters from an option window.  
    
    
Title: IntelliJ - a few questions
Description: 
    
    
                    
I just recently changed IDEs from Netbeans to IntelliJ-Idea. I like it much more so far, but there a few questions I have about it.

First off, how do I create custom code completion words? For example you could go into the Netbeans settings and create a template with a word, say 'syso', and you would type 'syso' and press tab and it would change it to System.out.println in the code editor. Is this possible in IntelliJ? I have searched the settings and googled it but I can't seem to figure it out.

Second, the tabs are a little irritating sometimes. When I open a new tab it places it right after the current tab selected, and it bothers me, is it possible to make it appear last after all the tabs?

Other than that, I am loving this IDE much more because of its amazing auto-completion and UI.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Well your first requirement is covered nicely by IntelliJ IDEA. 

Live Templates

You can define Live Templates by opening the Preferences. 



Then you can easily add or modify live templates. The good thing is they are grouped.

Now you can choose your desired group and then add a new live template.


Then you can define the abbreviation, for example syso, and edit the form like this:


Then you have to define the context this template applies to



Default Live Templates

There are a multitude of default live templates already supported out of the box. For instance the one you want in this case is sout, which is provided by default. You can read more about this in JetBrains Docs
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Your first requirement is covered by live templates.  These allow you to, on a per-language basis, add a little bit of templatable syntax and allow you to specify your expansion character to help with your development.

I will note that the System.out.println case is already well covered by both these templates and postfix completion; the former allowing you to type sout then TAB to get System.out.println; the latter allowing you to type your expression and then sout to have it wrapped in a System.out.println statement.

The piece about tab ordering is an issue I haven't encountered before.  More times than not I find myself using the Recent Files menu (CTRL + E or Command + E).  I don't believe there's a way to enforce ordering of tabs.

How can one enable or use multi line editing in Qt Creator under Linux?

I know it from Windows to be shift+alt+up/down to get multiple cursors. Now on Linux, I can only use shift+alt+down to copy or paste columns of multiple lines, but i don't get multiple cursors to edit directly.
Shift+alt+up triggers an (probably) Ubuntu specific tab view, so that i can't use it. I also can't seem to find that shortcut in the shortcut menu to disable it. =(

My Linux Distribution is ubuntu 12.04 LTS
and Qt Creator is version 3.0.1
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The column editing feature was introduced in Qt Creator 3.2 (http://blog.qt.digia.com/blog/2014/08/19/qt-creator-3-2-0-released/). So an update should do the trick.

installed Resharper 8.1
Installed latest StyleCop-4.7.49.0

Configured my .csproj to work with stylecop and have build errors and all (straight from StyleCop settings). Copied to the .sln folder the Settings.StyleCop file.

Answer 1: 

    
    
StyleCop 4.7.49 is not compatible with Resharper 8.1. The StyleCop - Resharper integration is not completely in sync with all the latest versions so to get full compatibility you need to run Resharper 8.2.

For example :
Search string : abcd
Search in : Module1
Search NOT in : Module1/path1/x/folder2/, Module1/path2/y/folder1/

Any idea to get this done ?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

Open the Search in Path dialog (CTRL+SHIFT+F)
Select custom scope and click the ... button next to it
You can create new scope (green plus icon) in the dialog that is shown by including and excluding files/directories to search
Click OK when you're done
Now you can search using this scope and you can use it for future searches


For instance this screenshot shows custom scope for searching only in com.company package:

Title: Warning for dangling connection in IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there any IDE, like Eclipse or Intellij that support warnings about dangling connections.
For example:

Connection conn = null;
if (conn != null) {
     try {
         Statement createStatement = conn.createStatement();
     } catch (SQLException e) {
         // Accidentally forgot to close conn. 
     }
}


Is there an option to get such an warning in any language? NetBeans seems like it doesn't have such a feature.

Title: Is there any Programming language that can directly execute MathType Formula?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Let's take an example of Java. A rich text IDE is never found for now, and plain-text IDE is the mainstream. 

I have read many times Latex formula in IDE with codes from github and it's hard to understand the symbols without the help of any TeX-like software. 

I just envision the birth of such an IDE which can integrate Word, OneNote, etc., where codes like class can be highlighted, copy paste like picture while editted like plain/rich html, multimedia objects can be used as explanations, just like the matlab helper not the plain javadoc, can be compared with 2 or more classes in multi-column in one file in one time, which is a great view of Java Class hierarchy, just like what OneNote can do, so that I can get rid of the limit that codes can only be written in one column in plain text editor. Frankly, OneNote is not an IDE but is a real rich text IDE prototype, which contains all the intuitiveness of writing/ordering something such as codes but to run codes, However, these features are just like a patent which can only be seen in OneNote, and can not be found in any famous or less programming environment. I can not help recalling, historically, the development of the width of rail tracks limits the size of imagination, which repeats in my brain each time I use OneNote.

What's more, although many IDE contains highlight grammar, it is still a plain-text code, which can be generated very fast from rich text one by just removing explanation areas.

The Mathtype-like formula is so much better than plan-text formula in plain text IDE, which I can feel in OneNote by pasting codes and formula together, especially when it is a fraction or rooting formula. What a pity, the formula can not run directly. Actually, they can be generated from the same format, namely xml-like rich text.

I just found one interesting piece of such a code in a PDF file from the Unicode website, which is  much better to capture the real function of the program function:

	gammap = gamma*sqrt(1 + I2);

The length of the two above is obviously longer than the 3rd one.

If you can not see the 3rd in image, please visit the Original Pdf here, from page 33 to 35.

A small question is, should such a habit of plain text programming still be thought as a good one after such an IDE come into being? High level programming language is stuck with this prejudice of being satisfied with plain text coding while the helper is multimedia.The varients/constants are all ASCII-like, while Unicode sets are just partially supported. And it is so elegent in Mathtype-like formula to read and use in brain, while it is impossible to subscript an index like what we read in textbook in an IDE and programming languages like Java still need brackets.

The final question is whether such an IDE or Programming language that can run Mathtype-like formula or code like Math exist or not?

PS: I know the executing order in the Mathtype formula can result in low effciency when loops exist, but, it is not the problem, as a programmer, I can manually seperate these polynomials into fragments and add them in loops, but machine can facilitate them, too.

PS2: Mathematica is great for Math researchers around science community, despites its high price. I try to download and use it and I am really attracted by its simplicity-like interface and notation system, such as many games can be implemented with much fewer lines and the helper is very human-friendly and intelligent, just like an input method! And the helper is also able to run codes, which is a definate improvement for this and following generation to learn programming, maybe not only the Mathematica language.

Firstly, the concept "Notebook" in Mathematica is the ultimate code editor that I can find for now, which can use Mathtype-like components in representng algorithms and it is just so valuable to adopt such a concept into other Programming languages or their plain-text IDEs, because Mathematica has its own limits such as the lack of certain existent features in other language which are also important. 

I can not help recalling the traditional way of command line programming in windows or linux in last century, which is not so much different from plain-text IDE programming nowadays. By the way, the Mathematica workbench is a specified version of Eclipse IDE which is just not able to code in a Mathematica "Notebook" way, what a pity for now.

Reading others' codes is much more difficult than writing codes, especially of algorithms, and the codes I write are difficult to read in future both for me and others, if there is not a way to just display Mathtype-like symbols in rich text IDE like what Mathematica can do, running Symbols is another thing.

Secondly, even in "Notebook", the components can not be arranged freely in an OneNote way, the width is infinity means a real infinity in OneNote, you can paste anything into the right side far from the first column filled with anything like rich text in OneNote and can be viewed using horizontal scroll bar. The obvious benefit of this feature is an umlimited comparing 2 or more codes from the same parent class or algorithm variants, I guess its also useful for version controlling, just like a continious scrolling of horizontally comparing 10 files in BeyondCompare without the vertical scroll bars of each but the last one, just like a 1*N matrix of classes, not one column. 

Maybe several years later, those features as I mensioned can be realized in Mathematica, too.

I heard about "Source code is the documentation" like old sayings, which is not yet the reality at all.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Maybe not MathType exactly, but Mathematica with its IDE allows you to perform symbolic programming with all those fancy mathematical symbols. Its "successor", Wolfram Language, should be able to do it as well and more.

The only problem is that its quite expensive. But there is a 30-day trial version so you might check if this suits your needs.

You have two "main" functions defined.

Description: 
    
    
                    
This is not a code question but an Xcode IDE question.
For those who pride themselves in code analysis, that's good, but in this case, please try to focus on the question in the Title above not the code.

In the Xcode IDE I created a new project and selected a "Command Line Tool" creating ReadAFile.
I then entered some simple code into main.c to read and display the contents of "Data.txt".
I then selected File, New, File, and selected Empty (For an empty document) and named it Data.txt and then I typed out a sentence then saved the file.
In Xcode, when I choose Product, Run, I get the following error:

Error while opening the file.
: No such file or directory
Program ended with exit code: 1


Where do I set the Xcode IDE property so that it knows where my data file is to avoid getting the "No such file or directory" error?

When I enter the very same code into ReadAFile.c and I type out the very same file "Data.txt" at a terminal prompt using vim, save it, and run make ReadAFile, the code executes properly.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    char ch, file_name[25];
    FILE *fp;
    strcpy(file_name,"Data.txt");
    fp = fopen(file_name,"r");
    if( fp == NULL ) {
        perror("Error while opening the file.\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("The contents of %s file are :\n", file_name);
    while( ( ch = fgetc(fp) ) != EOF )
        printf("%c",ch);

That's a good question... I have a temporary, work around, answer...
I do respect your request to focusing on the question rather than your code.
As a quick temporary answer, the only answer I have for you at this point is to modify your code, for now, if you are only debugging your code along with your data file. I know hard coding your file locations is a no-no but for debugging purposes the following will get you over this bump in your road. You can try to hard code the directory location along with your data file so that your code can find it. For example, let's say that your Users directory on your Mac is jerryletter, you could copy your Data.txt file to your Users directory ~/jerryletter. Then  could modify just one line of your code like the following:

"strcpy(file_name,"/Users/jerryletter/Data.txt");"

I'm using Netbeans for quite a long time but I'd like to know if I can do the following thing:

[A] [B]
[A] [C]


I'd like the IDE to open JS files in the tab A, CSS in tab B and... PHP files in tab C. Or maybe the files from my Project 1 in tab A, files from Project 2 in tab B....

Or something like that, is there any way to make such rules like these?

Answer 1: 

    
    
It works this way for different component types: project tab / files tab / editors / outputs / debugger windows / ... But since all editors share the same space in windowing system (Mode) there is no simple way to do this. Writing a plugin that would do this shuffling on editor open event is non-trivial tasks. You can rearrange them manually though.

I installed Anaconda (python version 2.7) with Spyder on my Windows 8.1 machine.  I'm taking some tutorials and would like to write a short program that I can run from Spyder - it should take user input and print it.  Literally something like:

var = raw_input()

I have a big Delphi 2007 project, and the Delphi IDE is slow and unstable even I install DelphiSpeedUP, FixIDE Pack.

The IDE freezes for a few seconds when first loading the project (300K lines of code). The Type Library Editor is very inefficient when I want to add a new method/property because it has around 1000 APIs and it kinda freezes for ten seconds in the Type Library Editor.

But the Delphi Compiler is good and I am happy with that, just the IDE has many issues. The Visual Studio 2010/2012 is very good and stable.

Just wondering if it is possible to code in Delphi in the Visual Studio, a basic syntax highlighting, debugger is OK.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It is not possible.

Visual Studio not work with pascal lang.

You can use np++ for simple syntax highlighting and compile with command lines in DCC32.exe.

and the docs in here.

and for Debug use ollydb.

and I'll not suggest it.

and I think the likely pascal IDE to Delphi is Lazarus but it can't compile your Delphi source code directly.

and I'll not suggest it too.

I think use the Delphi with fix and speedup patches.

When I want to paste some text in to emacs (running in windows+cygwin+console mode emacs)
I have to issue a
    M-x xterm-mouse-mode
command to make it work. And to go about doing the regular
things I have to switch it off.

What is a better solution?

IIRC when in xterm-mouse-mode, you can paste with shift+middle-button.
