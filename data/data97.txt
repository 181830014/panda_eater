Title: Scanf executed before printf in Eclipse
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have the following simple code in C language:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(){
    printf("Give an integer:\n");
    int x;
    scanf("%d",&amp;x);
    printf("10*%d=%d\n",x,10*x);

    return 0;
}


Using CodeBlocks IDE it is executed in the right order but when I use Eclipse IDE it jumps 
to the scanf command and then prints the messages as it should. Can anyone explain this? 

Thank you in advance
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Usually stdout is set to line buffered. Apparently one of your IDEs sets it to fully buffered.

You can force prints to dump the associated buffer with fflush(), eg

printf("hello ");   // works in unbuffered stream
printf("world!\n"); // works in line buffered stream
fflush(stdout);     // works in fully buffered stream

You need to exclude paths from Defender so that Pycharm works better.  See this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433724/1457859
    
    
Title: Is it possible to use CLI along with GUI?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've read a lot about advantages(speed and flexibility for example) of using .NET Command-line interface so i tried it. I created new ASP.NET Web Api project via PowerShell. It was all good until i wanted to install some Nuget packages. I could not do it in the IDE(VS2019) because the Nuget manager is disabled(package menager console gives me 'No default project). I added Entity Framework package using CLI but first i had to created new solution(using CLI) to the project for some reason. Now to make migration i need to use commands for EF... how is it more flexible than using GUI? It seems for me it's one or another.
My question: how do you guys use CLI? Is there a really good reason to use it?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

  Is it possible to use CLI along with GUI?


Actually, it can be done and since you want to use CLI to create a project the same as GUI does(have a xxx.sln file). Since dotnet command line is quite simple to create a project but creating it as VS IDE does(xxxx.csproj with SLN files and all levels of projects) requires a further command like these:

1) use cmd to cd a folder called Project and then type this:

dotnet new mvc -o &lt;Solution_Name&gt;/&lt;Project_Name&gt; -n &lt;Project_Name&gt;


Then create a solution folder and the project but it lacks the &lt;Solution_Name&gt;.sln file. And you should use dotnet sln command.

2) create the a file named &lt;Solution_Name&gt;.sln under the Solution folder and add these in that file:

Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 12.00
# Visual Studio Version 16
VisualStudioVersion = 16.0.28701.123
MinimumVisualStudioVersion = 10.0.40219.1


Then CMD: 

cd &lt;Solution_Name&gt;
dotnet sln add &lt;Solution_Name&gt;.sln &lt;Project_Name&gt;\&lt;Project_Name&gt;.csproj


3) Then it will created as the GUI does.

Besides, CLI is simple and convenient(apply for a single project) but if should be as GUI does(a solution contains several projects), it needs to do some extra operation like some other commands, by GUI, it will automatically be created without any steps. 

In addition, if you want to install a nuget package by CLI, you could use dotnet add package command without install it in GUI, like this:

CMD

dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json -v 12.0.1

Update 1

In fact, each has its advantages and disadvantages, the score situation to deal with.

To create a single project and do something about the current project，using CLI is more convenient. It takes a lot less of the computer's system resources and it can react quickly and improve performance. However, if it involves multiple complex projects, and strive to operate on multiple projects, because CLI is too direct and not as visual as GUI, easy to operate, it is too complicated to be suitable for novices.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I want my IDE to stop showing me the unreadable generated files when I search. Say I have a protobuf file foo.proto :

message bar {}


and I generate the python package foo_pb2.py (and the foo_pb2.pyi). When searching (double up arrow button/shift) for foo I'd like to see the protobuf definition in foo.proto but not the generated code in foo_pb2.py. 

I managed to get the first thing to work by installing the "Protobuf Support" addon but I cannot find anything for the second part.

Similarly, when using the "Declaration" functionality (cmnd + click) I get sent to foo_pb2.py file instead of foo.proto. Is there a way to map these correctly?

One way to ignore them is to basically put them in an excluded folder. PyCharm will exclude these folders entirely.


    
    
Title: Clang format for banner style
Description: 
    
    
                    
An open-source project I contribute to uses banner style (also called Ratliff style). It looks like that:

 // In C
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
     if (i % 2 == 0) {
         doSomething(i);
         }
     else {
         doSomethingElse(i);
         }
     }


Some IDE's like QtCreator have their own configurations for formatting, but others, like Visual Studio Code, require a .clang-format file.

I looked online for existing configurations, and couldn't find any. Then I tried to make one from scratch using this clang-format generator, but I couldn't manage to indent the braces right.

So, is it possible to create a clang-format file for Ratliff/Banner style, or is there some missing configuration that will force us to use some other generator?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This answer is not going to be the "answer" that you were looking for, but it is what I've discovered over the last two days of digging through the code for clang-format. I, too, have been looking for a way to auto-format a variant of banner style with clang-format.

clang-format seems to be missing some capabilities that would enable it to auto-format banner style.

For instance, you need to indent ending (right) braces for code blocks. clang-format does not even appear to track ending braces, but it does track starting (left) braces within its internals.

I started out my studying streak thinking I could understand the way clang-format implements its formatter system, so I could add the features needed to do it. Sadly it was way too complicated for me.

Perhaps someday we will be able to auto-format banner style with clang-format, but not today.

If someone out there knows this answer is inaccurate, please don't hesitate to correct me.

edit: Instead of giving you just a verification of what can't be done with clang-format, perhaps you might find http://astyle.sourceforge.net useful.

Overall, your problem is that you're trying to run a program that is interactive from within Sublime; it doesn't support that. Sublime captures output your program sends to stdout and stderr and displays it in the output panel, but it does't connect the panel to stdin.

So, the scenario you're encountering works like this:


You run your program, which is interactive (in your case it prompts for input via scanf(), and it launches and prompts you for input
You try to enter input, but nothing happens because stdin isn't connected.
You try to run your program again (or modify it and build it again thinking you might have an issue). 
The version you previously tried to run is still running in the background waiting for input you can't provide, and windows locks executable files while the program is running. So, when the linker (collect2) tries to link the executable during the build, it can't because the file is locked, hence the permission error.


You can clear the error by killing the program running in the background, which you can do via the Tools &gt; Cancel Build if you do it before this error occurs; if you've already seen the error this likely won't work because this only cancels the most recent build, which would be the one where the error occurred.

The other thing you can do is use something external to kill it; the task manager on windows, kill from a terminal on Linux/OSX, etc. You'll need to do it this way if you're already seeing the error.

Note however that this doesn't solve your underlying problem because you're still trying to run an interactive program. In order to do that from within Sublime you need to create a custom sublime-build that allows for this. Generally you'd either have it spawn an external terminal and run the program in there, or use a package like Terminus if you want to keep it internal.

In order to set this up, you need to be familiar with the sequence of commands that are needed to compile, link and run a program in one command, which you can get by checking what the build system you're currently using is (assuming you didn't create it yourself).

This video on buffering and interactive builds in Sublime (disclaimer, I'm the author) has information and examples of how Terminus can be used for something like this if you'd like more information.

Some of the supported "refactorings and code actions" are described in:


https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-editing#_refactoring-and-code-actions.  


When I looked at this, I could not see a code action for enclosing a statement in a try / catch.  However, at the bottom it says:


  "The list of Code Actions supported by VS Code keeps growing and only listed the most popular ones above.".


So ... my suggestion would be to look in the menu in your Visual Studio / VS Code.  Also, watch the release notes and the issue tracker for the Redhat project that is developing the Java plugin.



UPDATE - In fact, here is the issue:


https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/300


So it looks like there is a code action to do this.  Merged in September 2017.

Answer 1: 

    
    
From the Flutter FAQ:

Does Flutter work with any editors or IDEs?
We support plugins for Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and VS Code.
See editor configuration for setup details, and Android Studio/IntelliJ and VS Code for tips on how to use the plugins.
Alternatively, you can use a combination of the flutter command in a terminal and one of the many editors that support editing Dart.

So, no
You cannot get the same tooling in Visual Studio that you can get in Android Studio/IntelliJ and VS Code because the Flutter team does not work on support for any other IDEs.
If you visit IDEs and editors for Dart, you can see what code editors have support for editing Dart code and you can use that in conjunction with the flutter command to get a similar experience.
    
    
Title: Is there any IDE for OSDEV?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there any IDE to create operating systems in C/C++/Assembly?
If there, please tell me how to setup it for OSDEV or point me to a good tutorial.

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
To my knowledge there really aren't any IDEs specifically geared toward operating systems development, although there are several options available for the languages most commonly used for such work. In general there's not much of a difference between OSDev and any other kind of C/C++/Assembly development, so any ordinary IDE equipped for those languages should suffice. My personal favorite is Eclipse CDT, which, like other Eclipse products, can be extended with plugins for Assembly development, etc.

Some other IDEs worth mentioning are Code::Blocks, CLion, or even command-line text editors like vim and nano. Whatever you are most comfortable with for other C/C++ development should work just fine for OS development.

Where OSDev and ordinary C/C++ development may differ, however, is in the build process. Usually a C/C++ project is compiled into a binary file which is then executed on the machine, while a kernel image will be designed to either function as a mountable boot drive, or be loaded by another bootloader. This requires more than just compilation, and as far as I know, there aren't any IDEs which will immediately support, for example, creating a disk image from compiled code. For this, I recommend GNU make, which can run Makefiles that contain the steps to incrementally build and run your operating system. A good resource for learning about how to write makefiles can be found here, with the official manual serving as extra guidance.

In short, any functional C/C++ IDE will suffice for OS development, while a slightly more complex build system will be required to actually run/test your operating system.
    
    
Title: How does IDEs automatically downloads the sources for dependencies
Description: 
    
    
                    
Most of the IDEs nowadays supports downloading the sources for added dependencies and it quite work well when we want to look the Class/Interface/Method definitions into source code.

My question is around how IDEs figure out the sources (artifacts containing source code) online and automatically downloads them.

Lets say I want to publish my library as open source and make it the part of maven central repo, what do I need to do in order to support this Download Sources functionality?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
In the Maven ecosystem, source files are commonly bundled into a specific package with the maven-source-plugin:


  The Source Plugin creates a jar archive of the source files of the current project. The jar file is, by default, created in the project's target directory.


By convention, the name of the source package ends with -sources.jar such as hsqldb-1.8.0.7-sources.jar. The sources part of the name is known, in Maven, as the classifier:


  The classifier distinguishes artifacts that were built from the same POM but differ in content. It is some optional and arbitrary string that - if present - is appended to the artifact name just after the version number.
  
  [...] use case for classifiers is to attach secondary artifacts to the project's main artifact. If you browse the Maven central repository, you will notice that the classifiers sources and javadoc are used to deploy the project source code and API docs along with the packaged class files.


Knowing this convention, it's easy for an IDE to retrieve the source files of dependencies from Maven central or from other configured Maven repositories.

I think the way to do this may be to use Lazarus IDE macros.

See https://wiki.freepascal.org/IDE_Macros_in_paths_and_filenames for full documentation.

In the section IDE Macros it says


  IDE macros: they can be used in almost all IDE fields, e.g. search paths, custom options, file names, run parameters. They are replaced with their value before calling external tools like the compiler or the debugger. They are case insensitive.


and the IDE macro format section includes a few examples of ones which are already defined.

Creating macros is explained here: https://wiki.freepascal.org/Macros_and_Conditionals

To set a macro up for the current project, do the following:


Go to Project | Project Options | Compiler Options | Additions and Overrides
On the righthand side, click  Add and select IDE Macro from the drop-down menu
This will open an IDE Macro line in the editor below.  In it, replace
MacroName by MyCustomPath and Value by whatever you like.  I used D:\Lazarus2\MA
Close the Project Options pop-up


Next, in the directory that MyCustomPath points to, create a unit e.g. Test.Pas that includes a compile stopper like an !  I used

unit Test

interface
!
implementation

end.


Add Test.Pas to the project's Uses list and attempt to compile.  The compiler should complain that it can't find Test.Pas.

Next, open Project | Project Options | Compiler Options | Paths and in the Other unit files box at the top insert $(MyCustomPath)

Close Project Options  and compile - now the compilation should proceed until it encounters the compile-stopping ! in Test.Pas

Title: Tomcat does not reload jsp pages
Description: 
    
    
                    
Sometimes a problem of this nature arises.

I use Tomcat and Inteliji Idea. I make changes in jsp pages, and when I deploy the project in a browser, Tomcat opens the old version of the jsp page, and if I make changes in the servlet, the behavior of the jsp pages changes, but the visual component does not change.

What to do so that the volume normally reloads the page ???
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
For the JSP reloading to work you need to use Exploded artifact configuration in IntelliJ IDEA and use the Update action (either explicitly, or by configuring the IDE to perform the Update on frame deactivation). The Update action has to be set to update the classes and resources. More details can be found in this document.

Some frameworks like JSF may introduce caching which will prevent the Update from working properly. In this case you'll need to disable the framework caching. For JSF caching configuration please refer to this answer.
    
    
Title: Add PHP Dynamic Methods in IDE Autocomplete
Description: 
    
    
                    
I need to make some dynamic methods in my PHP class. 

Using this class:

class SampleClassWithDynamicMethod
{
    public function __call($methodName, $values)
    {
        if(!method_exists($this, $methodName)){
            // Do something...
            return "You called $methodName!";
        }
    }

$sample = new SampleClassWithDynamicMethod();
echo $sample-&gt;test(); 
// You called test!

echo $sample-&gt;anotherTest();
// You called anotherTest!

echo $sample-&gt;moreTest(); 
// You called moreTest!


It works well. But how can I let the IDE know this class has these dynamic methods with these names: test(), anotherTest() and moreTest()?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use PHP DocBlocks. These are supported by major PHP IDEs.

Specifically, the @method annotation. Check the docs.

Using the example from the docs:

/**
  * @method string getString()
  * @method void setInteger(integer $integer)
  * @method setString(integer $integer)
  * @method static string staticGetter()
  */
 class Child extends Parent
 {
     // &lt;...&gt;
 }


This would declare that could could do any of the following, which would be recognized by the IDE and offered for auto-completion (obviously, assuming the methods have been implemented in some way):

$child = new Child();
$child-&gt;setInteger(10);
$child-&gt;setString(2);
echo $child-&gt;getString();
// 2

$string = Child::staticGetter();

Methods and computed added locally works fine and are recognized by WebStorm (green arrows)

But getters and actions are not: Unresolved variable or type... (blue and red arrows)

Hello there are tests written on Java + cucumber
The structure is as follows:

https://i.imgur.com/moLVY6L.png 

The main question is how to run this tests not from the IDE, say from the console or even wrap it all in jar file

The problems encountered are that you need the main class to create a jar,

It seems as there is a certain java cucumber.api.cli.Main - but how to use it I do not understand. Either way, there's probably a way to run this just from the command line. Please tell us how to do it?

You can download Maven with following terminal script : 

$brew install maven


After brew installation, you need to go to the project directory which includes pom.xml file in terminal :

$cd /path/of/your/project


And finally you can run following command to run your tests : 

$mvn clean test

Which version? 
You can use any version. But the latest is always better.

Which JRE? 
If you are developing applications using Java you need to install JDK. It will install the JRE. And you need to add JDK bin path to your System Variables. And here and here are examples that showing how to do that.

How to setting up JDBC Connection, 
First, you need to download the MySQL Connector for Java.

And setting up a JDBC connection in Eclipse is much easier. You can try this,

Right-click on your Java Project in the Package Explorer in the Eclipse workspace and go to Properties
Go down the list that appears until you find Java Build Path and click Libraries and then click Add External Archives.
Find the downloaded jar file called mysql-connector-java-version number.jar and choose it. This should import your jar file to Eclipse!

Finally, 
And now you can code. Sample Java JDBC Connection,

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.Statement;

class MySQLConnection {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Connection con = null;

    String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/some_db";
    String username = "some_username":
    String password = "some_password";

    try {
      Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
      con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);

      System.out.println("Connected!");

    } catch (SQLException ex) {
        throw new Error("Error ", ex);
    } finally {
      try {
        if (con != null) {
            con.close();
        }
      } catch (SQLException ex) {
          System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
      }
    }
  }
}


Hope this helps!
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You will need java mysql connector jar and add it to java build path.
Refer this : https://ibytecode.com/blog/jdbc-mysql-connection-tutorial/
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You can either use eclipse neon or eclipse IDE for Java Developers.Then you have to attach Mysql connection drivers to your program.Then you can write this code in your program.

Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
Connection conn=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test","root","root");

test is your db name you can write yours
    
    
Title: How can I use a JSDoc comment to eliminate an &ldquo;Unresolved function or method&rdquo; warning in WebStorm or other JetBrains products?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In WebStorm, PyCharm, and other JetBrains products you can use JSDoc comments to inform WebStorm that an object does have a specific property, thereby eliminating a warning.

Either @namespace or @property works well for plain object properties, but I can't find a JSDoc command that works for functions.

const query = require(...);
...
Object.keys(record)
    .forEach(col =&gt; {
        query.set(col, record[col]);
    });


In the snippet above, .set(...) is not recognized by WebStorm and produces an Unresolved function or method warning.

This is only a single example. My project uses multiple third-party libraries and many of those libraries have object methods that trigger the warning on use. There are no typescript definitions available for these libraries, and WebStorm's file analysis doesn't pick up on them.

I cannot modify the query object, nor can I change how it is imported. Is there a JSDoc comment I can add to eliminate the warning? I've tried multiple variations of @property, @param, @namespace, and @member.

notes:

I know that the warning can be disabled by using a // noinspection JSUnresolvedFunction on the line directly above the use of the function, but this is an inferior solution. The JSDoc comments can be placed in multiple scopes, such as the start of the class or function definition. The JSDoc solution also improves readability and has meaning in other, non-JetBrains IDEs.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
JSDoc provides the way to explicitly annotate symbols with @type

So in your example it's could be:

/** @type {QueryObjectTypeDef} */
const query = require(...);


Also same effect could be achieved (tested in WebStorm) with inline annotation of function args:

forEach((/* ColTypeDef */ col) =&gt; {...})

    
    
Title: IntelliJ is not enforcing right margin
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a checkstyle active that complains if a line is longer than 100 columns, and I've set my intelliJ config to hard wrap at 100 columns.

The issue is that it is not always enforcing this, resulting in cases where the checkstyle fails and the only way around it is disabling the formatting in the IDE and manually do the formatting.

So this is a short (and stupid) example of where it fails

class TestClass {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String superString = "s";
        String bestString = "b";
        Arrays.asList(superString.split(""))
              .stream()
              .map(superiorString -&gt; Arrays.asList(bestString.split(""))
                                           .stream()
                                           .map(otherSub -&gt; Arrays.asList(superiorString.split(""))
                                                                  .stream()
                                                                  .map(qwerty -&gt; Arrays.asList(
                                                                          otherSub.split(""))
                                                                                       .stream()
                                                                                       .map(dvorak -&gt; null))));

Answer 1: 

    
    
From Preferences &gt; Editor &gt; Code Style &gt; Java select the Wrapping and Braces tab and scroll to  Chained method calls then:


Set Wrap always
Tick the Wrap first call option
Tick the Align when multiline option




With that configuration your code will be formatted like so:

public static void main(String[] args) {
    String superString = "s";
    String bestString = "b";
    Arrays
            .asList(superString.split(""))
            .stream()
            .map(superiorString -&gt; Arrays
                    .asList(bestString.split(""))
                    .stream()
                    .map(otherSub -&gt; Arrays
                            .asList(superiorString.split(""))
                            .stream()
                            .map(qwerty -&gt; Arrays
                                    .asList(
                                            otherSub.split(""))
                                    .stream()
                                    .map(dvorak -&gt; null))));
}

Title: VSCODE. How to open a file containing a variable or html tag by clicking it?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm not sure how to describe the question properly. I used to use IDE tools such as IntelliJIdea. One of the useful functions from intelliJ was to open an external file by clicking an imported variable or component. I wonder if there is such functionality in vscode too. Although I tried looking up in the document, I couldn't find information about it. Does vscode really not have that convenient functionality? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Visual Studio Code does provide this feature. 

If you hold down the Ctrl key in VSCode and for example hover over a function call, a small info box appears (like shown below). 



If you now click on it (while still holding down Ctrl), VSCode automatically opens the corresponding file in a new tab and jumps to the line where the function was defined. 



This works for variables, instances of classes etc. as well.

Katalon [WebUI] Select is meant only to select default html select component. Yours is custom select box.

You need to select that exactly same way as you do manually like


Click the menu 
Wait for dropdown to be visible 
Select the particular value based on name from your csv


Based on your html, your Katalon script will be like this,

TestObject menu = new TestObject('Menu').addProperty('css', ConditionType.EQUALS, "div.md-select-menu-container")
WebUI.click(menu)

TestObject dropdownValue = new TestObject('DropDownValue').addProperty('xpath', ConditionType.EQUALS, "//md-option[contains(text(), 'AVAN - Advancè')]")
WebUI.waitForElementVisible(dropdownValue, 30)
WebUI.click(dropdownValue)

    
    
Title: Visual Studio column selection - Select by word, not square
Description: 
    
    
                    
This seems like something I would have found hundreds of topics on. Yet I didn't find a single one. I wonder if no one cares or if I just overlooked something obvious.

In Visual Studio when you select a column and want to select the word your cursor is at in each line, when you do CtrlShift+(ARROW KEY), then it doesn't select by word as it SHOULD, but instead it selects a square.



BAD BEHAVIOUR (which VS has):





GOOD BEHAVIOUR (which would be expected, and is in every other IDE):





The Visual Studio ALT select is rendered useless in half the cases, actually in every case where you don't have the "coordinates" precisely the same on every line.



EDIT

I seem to have to explain why the VS behavior is bad, people apparently consider it ok. So the problem is that when you column select in VS, and you have it exactly like in the example, or even without tabs, you'd copy some =, though they won't be everywhere.

If you select a column like VS Code or JetBrains has it, you'll just copy WHAT IS NEEDED and that OBVIOUSLY being just the words in the column.

I have a solution for you, but you may not like it. It's using the new Multi-Caret Support in Visual Studio 2017.

Here is my example code where I want to copy only the property names (sorry for lack of inline images):
Multi-Caret Code Example


Using Ctrl + Alt + Click to click and add a caret to the end of each word. (If you screw up and click somewhere you didn't mean, like I do many times, then reclick to remove that caret and click on the correct spot.)
Multi-Caret End of Line
Now hold Ctrl + Shift and hit the ← Left Arrow. This will select to the beginning of the current word on each line.
Multi-Caret Word Selected
Copy/paste as you wish

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm new to VSCode (Visual Studio Code) and I'm coming from WebStorm.

When I used WebStorm I was able to use Command + ` to swap instances of WebStorm windows. This behavior is also found in Chrome when you use that shortcut to switch between Chrome windows.

Is there a way to do this on VSCode?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Two options using VS Code:


The workbench.action.switchWindow keybinding to select the window to switch to. It is bound to ctrlw by default
The workbench.action.quickSwitchWindow command. Unlike workbench.action.switchWindow, it automatically switches windows when you release the keys. It is not bound by default but you can configure a keybinding for it.


The OS may also provide this:

Title: Apache Spark: Infinite Loop when Running Job Remotely from IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a apache spark standalone cluster and I want to run spark's job on it from remote computer via IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ). When I create a jar file and send it to master and run it with spark-submit, every thing is ok, but in IDE, I can not run the job. There isn't any errors in output but I think Executors are created and killed repeatedly and this infinite loop continue until I kill the job. Part of the job's output is given below.

So, my question is What is the problem and how can I fix that? 
(OS in Cluster machines=ubuntu,OS in remote machine=Windows,Hadoop version in all machines=2.7.6,spark version in all machines=2.3). Also, I can see Spark,hadoop,HDFS UIs in my remote machine

I solved it. I just should set spark.driver.host option as mentioned in this link. Also if your program has some external jar files you should use setJar method and set path to those jar files as mentioned in that link.

Title: Inherit Viewcontroller in Swift when creating new files
Description: 
    
    
                    
I Have created a custom Base Class in my Swift project that I would like to inherit in all the viewcontrollers I used in the app. The problem i see is in Objective-C when we create a new files it gives suggestions if you have created any custom class of yours and would like to inherit from them but in swift it didn't gave me any suggestion i have to create a class by extending  provided classes and then have to manually replace the extended class to my view controller. 

Objective-c project 



Qestion : why it is not giving me suggestion to subclass from the class that i've created in my project. is this feature is available in swift or not? or is there anything I miss?


  Note: I had developed applications in Objective-C and this is the first time i'm using swift.

Just type manually subclass name without extension. (No .swift)

OR

class SSTableViewCell: ExpandingTableViewCell


where SSTableViewCell is your class &amp; ExpandingTableViewCell is parent
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can just write your class name in the Subclass of: field, it doesn't matter if you get autocomplete there or not. Or you can just leave the subclass of set to UIViewController and then when file is created change from:

class ViewController: UIViewController


to 

class ViewController: YourBaseClassViewController

    
    
Title: Android Studio renders file content with unreadable characters
Description: 
    
    
                    
Any file from any project I open is rendered with these weird unreadable characters.



It seems only constant field names are displayed correctly, as can be seen in view ids scroll and resultados and the layout name activity_main.The rest of texts in the IDE are correctly rendered. But the file contents are displayed with these strange characters.

However, when I copy and paste them somewehere else outside Andrid Studio, (for example, Notepad++ or Word) they are displayed correctly.

I can't fix it any way! I've tried changing the file enconding, opening a new project, creating a new project, restarting and invalidating cache, rebooting my PC. Only thing I'm left to do is reinstalling Android Studio.

The problem was the font was corrupt. I remembered that I had recently reinstalled the Hack font on my Windows, and it seems there is some issue regarding the way you install it. You cannot copy the font files to the Fonts folder in Windows. You must use an installer provided by Hack developers and restart after installing.

So just either change the font under File em/em
Title: How to convert large text pasted from clipboard into a single string?

I want to copy HTTP request's headers from Chrome to either of my Python editors (I am using Geany and Spider).

In the editor, I want to treat the pasted text as a single string, so I am putting ' around it like this:

'Accept:*/*
Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language:en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection:keep-alive

This however results in SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal on the first line.

Is this because of spaces or newline characters?

It works if I manually put everything into one line, but is there any way to avoid this manual work?

  Is this because of spaces or newline characters?


Yes, using single ' or double " quotes in python doesn't let you write a string longer than one line. If you want to write a multiline string, use triple-quotes:

'''Accept:*/*
Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language:en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection:keep-alive
...'''




Alternatively you can use string concatenation methods. But then you'll have to write the linebreaks explicitly (which makes this method inferior if you plan to copy-paste):

request = (
    'Accept:*/*\n'
    'Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate, br\n'
    'Accept-Language:en-US,en;q=0.9\n'
    'Connection:keep-alive\n'
    ...

There is no previous Windows GUI theme since 2018.1. JetBrains have made their own Windows theme that follows modern MS guidelines (e.g. Windows 10 look alike) and dotted tree lines is not there (as well as bigger spacing between elements etc).

I suggest following these tickets (star/vote/comment) to get notified on any progress. As it stands right now some improvements in this area are expected only for 2018.3 version or later.

Title: AppCode Indent After Comment
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using AppCode for Objective-C development. It seems like one of the recent updates has changed the behavior of how indents work after a comment.

Now, when I add a comment and then hit return to enter code on the next line I get this:



Hitting return again will keep the same level of indent, and hitting delete just returns the cursor to the comment line.

What I want is:

// Comment
self.theCodeStartsHere;


which I thought used to be the default.

I have also noticed that when I try to break a statement into multiple lines they no longer line up on the colons. I'm not sure if it's related, but the behavior seemed to start around the same time.

Any help would be appreciated!

Title: VB6 IDE Breakpointing at weird Locations, and Jumping to Random Lines with &ldquo;Step Into&rdquo;
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been experiencing some weird things in the VB6 IDE. When I set a breakpoint on one of the functions, The IDE Pauses on the wrong Sub. If I "Step Into" and follow the code. It "Appears" to be running the correct sub, based on the property gets being accessed. If I then click Stop VB6 Crashes.

I can't Post the entire source as its closed. 
But here's the Classes that are encountering the issue. 
Along with this Video Showing the bug.

In the video clip you can see, There is a breakpoint set on the "DoAutoSize" Sub. However the IDE Pauses on "OnChange". And Clicking the "Step Into" button Doesn't seem to follow the code properly.

The only thought I've had is that its related to the "Implements" Statement and that the Class that's Implementing Igui_Control isn't properly implemented.

You will need to reinstall as that is the only way to stop this. 
    
    
Title: Does Euphoria language have a shell?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm studying/learning Euphoria language because it seems the most adequate for a new project.
I'm used to test commands on the shell when writing Python and Scheme.
I have been trying to find a shell on OpenEuphoria without success.
The default interpreter, eui, always ask for a file to run.
I also tried WEE and RedyCode and didn't find any sign of a shell.
The question is the one in the title: Does Euphoria language has a shell?

P.S.: It also does not seem to be an Euphoria language group here, on Stack Overflow... I cannot even tag it. I suppose that I might not get an answer, but I'll try anyway. Thank you.

No, sorry.

I once made a start on one for Phix and just spent the last 10 minutes resurrecting that, so it is available on my machine, but not uploaded anywhere yet. However it is severely limited, one-shot fashion, eg you cannot declare a variable and then set it!

Probably best to discuss this further on the Euphoria language forum

Title: XCode, Visual Studio, and GitHub with C++
Description: 
    
    
                    
I just learned the basics for git bash and GitHub, and I want to start using a repository for a simple console-based text game in C++ that I will be making. I have a MacBook laptop that I use to code on the go in XCode, and when I am home I use my Windows desktop in Visual Studio.

My question is "How do I run a C++ program from GitHub for both of these IDE's after I have cloned it?"

Should I just get the same IDE for both computers, like Eclipse? I've done quite a bit of research, but everything seems super complicated. I am hoping that there's an easier way, as I'm just a hobby coder. I'm definitely willing to learn; I just hate copying and pasting commands without understanding what they do. Any help is appreciated :)

Edited: Clarified that I know how to clone. The running part is what I don't know how to do.

There really are several ways to do what you're asking.


Store the project files with your repo, usually in a dedicated folder


msvc (with version)
xcode
makefile
qt creator
kdevelop
etc....

generalize the c++ with another build-system like CMake


The first option will/can get annoying but it is usually where most people starting to learn to program go. It isn't too bad so long as you realize you'll probably have problems sharing your project as no one has 'quite' the same exact setup as you.

The second option is where most projects usually end up. You need to learn the intricacies of something like CMake but once you learn, projects can be made for almost any IDE/environment.
