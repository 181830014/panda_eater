Title: JavaFX: Where do print statements go when application is running outside IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
When writing code, for debugging purposes, you typically add System.out.println("something to print"), which prints to the output window of the IDE.

When you compile your code to a JAR or an EXE, hence running the application outside the IDE, does the application still print? or do print statements get ignored? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It depends on how you're running your application and possibly the system you're running on.

If you're running a JAR using java -jar Foo.jar on the command line then System.out will direct content to the console in which the program was run.

Java applications that don't use a console are typically run with javaw instead of java. The javaw program runs without a console and, according to this answer, the output stream will be null. This behavior may depend on the JDK and/or the OS.
    
    
Title: Codenvy: how to checkout single file or files/dirs using git?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I begin to use the one of the cloud IDEs which is Codenvy.

It seems the best one among the cloud IDEs, but I still find something troubles, such as git command.
I want to checkout a single file which I changed wrong when I realized,
but I even cannot find a normal git checkout way---even by using shell, the git commands are very limited.

I also have looked through its document about git here but nothing found.

Has anybody encountered this problem, please?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Checkout just one file is:

git checkout -- path/to/your/file


That would reset its content. If Codenvy has a shell allowing git commands, that would be one way to do it.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Basically this question can apply to IntelliJ or any JetBrains IDE.
I run tests in PyCharm 3.1 Community Edition with Nose runner.

In Run tool window in Statistics subwindow (it can be enabled by turning option Show Statistics in Run window menu see no1 on attached image) 
there is Time Elapsed (see no2) table column



I like to adjust time precision so when I run tests I would like to see time in microseconds instead milliseconds and I believe that tests will be measured with such precision.:)

Is there any way to do this?

Like the title says, I'm getting multiple build errors using C::B, all are saying undefined reference to '*'. I'm trying to build a program using OpenGL, GLFW, and GLEW. The top three things that it cant find every time are _imp__CreateDCW@16, _imp__GetDeviceCaps@8, _imp__DeleteDC@4. When looking on the internet, I saw that all of those methods were in the gdi32 library, which I made sure to add to the linker. The error appears to be happening as soon as I try to use methods from GLFW3. I've tried using different builds of GLFW using MinGW, which is what I'm using with Code::Blocks, but I cannot get the error to go away.

I am developing on Windows 8.1, using Code::Blocks 13.12.

Here is a list of everything I am linking and in the same order:


gdi32
kernel32
user32
opengl32
glu32
glfw3


Code::Blocks is turning out to be a bit of a hassle, but I really want to start to get used to it. Thanks to anyone who can help.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You've to pass -lgdi32 for the linker to know that you're using GDI functions. Also the order matters. On Windows 8 with MinGW 4.8.1 tool chain I give this:


glew
glfw3
opengl32
gdi32


And it works for me; I don't include the other win32 libraries. If you're using GLEW's static library make sure you define GLEW_STATIC either in CB or directly as -DGLEW_STATIC.

As for the IDE, I chose QtCreator with CMake and with no Qt SDK.

Title: Is there any video tutorial for setting up Scala IDE with usage of both external libraries and debugging your own source code projects dependencies?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there any video tutorial for setting up Scala IDE with usage of both external libraries and debugging your own source code projects dependencies ?

I think that four of the most fundamental things (which should be fairly easy to get started with) when learning a new language and development environment are to do the following things from within a good IDE (e.g. Scala IDE / Eclipse):

(1) Learn how to reuse third part libraries (the binary versions, when there is no need for debugging)

(2) Learn how to set up your development environment with multiple source code projects/libraries, and if you start the application (e.g. a main method) in one of the projects and when it is using code in another project, then you should be able to debug into the source code of the other project/library.

(3) Learn how to distribute/package the different projects into separate libraries, and make them deployable and reusable in a context when binary usage is enough (i.e. as in item 1 above when you want to reuse third part libraries and do not need to debug the source code of the libraries)

(4) Learn how to deploy the application in such a way that you can start its execution normally i.e. from outside of any IDE (but using the artifacts, e.g. jar files, which you have created with the IDE) 

If the kind of video tutorial I am looking for still not exists then I would like to encourage someone with the needed skills to create it and make it easy to find, e.g. try to make it published here:
http://scala-ide.org/docs/videos.html
(but currently there is only a Scala debugger video tutorial without teaching how to manage multiple projects).

Of course, it would also be desirable to publish a link to it from within this stackoverflow page which likely will be found by other frustrated developers looking for a good video tutorial about how to reuse and debug multiple projects.

These things I mentioned above should really not have to be as complicated as it is to get started with, which is proven by the development environment Visual Studio in combination with package managet NuGet.
I consider the steep lurning curve of learning and fiddling with the Scala development environment setup as a problem which I think will cause people to give up and instead prefer to use .NET development (C# and Visual Studio with NuGet).

This is not because the language C# is better than Scala but because it so much easier to learn to use Visual Studio and NuGet (visually and intutitive, with right-clicking) than it is to learn how to  use compatible versions of Eclipse, Scala, SBT, Ivy and how to manually configure build.sbt, build.scala, build.properties, and using compatible versions and percentage characters "%%" or "%" in sbt files, and scalaVersion etc.

As I mentioned, all these things are more easy to learn with Visual Studio and NuGet, but the learning curve for Scala development is really annoying, and when you have spent a couple  of hours with SBT documentation and Googling for errors about "unresolved dependencies" it is tempting to give up on Scala, which I think is sad, since the Scala language itself indeed has potential.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I agree that getting started isn't as easy as it should be. Have you tried Activator? It makes it easy to create your first project and explains each step. It also has a way to export your project to Eclipse or IntelliJ. It has an sbt template, but I don't know if there is a multi-project setup.

Here's a few pointers that might help others in the same situation, until a more complex video is produced:


setting up jar dependencies (or inter-project dependencies) in Scala IDE is identical to how you'd do it for Java projects. (for example, see this question)
debugging projects that depend on each other requires no special action (if the step above worked fine)
deploying and execution outside of the IDE is best done using sbt (see this question).


Hope this helps.

I'm going to write hell lot of test cases using protractor framework. I've installed Netbeans IDE for that but I'm not able configure it correctly for my tests. It would be very helpful if  anybody can give a tutorial to create a protractor project in netbeans IDE.

The future release of Netbeans 8.1 will have support for Protractor 

wiki.netbeans.org/NewAndNoteworthyNB81#Protractor

For now, you can download Netbeans nightly which also has configuration for Protractor by going to the Project Properties, and clicking on the category, Selenium Testing


    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I think you should use webstorm instead as it's more adapted to protractor. Even if you manage to install it you won't get any support as i don't think netbeans is used with protractor.

Answer 2: 

    
    
         FileWritter, a character stream to write characters to file. By default, it will 
        replace all the  existing content with new content, however, when you specified a true (boolean)
        value as the second argument in FileWritter constructor, it will keep the existing content and 
        append the new content in the end of the file.
        fout = new FileWriter("filename.txt", true);
        the true is enabling append mode .

write Like:
BufferedWriter outputWriter = null;
outputWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(getClass().getResource("valS.txt").getFile(),true));

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Assuming your Status array is not empty, this code will work but the file text file will be updated in the compiled/output directory

So the text file in the source directory will not be updated, but the one in the output directory will.

Also note that the constructor of FileWirter you are using will overwrite the content of the file so you should use the one with the append argument:

public FileWriter(String fileName, boolean append) throws IOException 


EDIT : if you REALLY need to update a file in the src directory you could do it like, this.
Not really nice but this will work

public void updateF()throws Exception
{

    String fileName = "valS.txt";
    File fileInClasses = new File(getClass().getResource(fileName).getFile());
    System.out.println(fileInClasses.getCanonicalPath());
    File f = fileInClasses;
    boolean outDir = false;

    // let's find the output directory
    while(!outDir){
        f = f.getParentFile();
        outDir = f.getName().equals("out");
    }

    // get the parent one more time
    f = f.getParentFile();

    // from there you should find back your file
    String totoPath = f.getPath()+"/src/com/brol/" + fileName;
    File totoFile = new File(totoPath);

    BufferedWriter outputWriter = null;
    outputWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(totoFile, true));
    outputWriter.append("test");
    outputWriter.flush();

I am using Xcode 5 to add features to an Xcode 4 iPad project. I have set the project to use the iOS 6.1 SDK in Xcode 5 because I am not ready to move to the 7.1 style interface.

When I attach an iPad Mini running iOS 7 to my development machine for testing, the Mini appears on my target selection list twice. One selection runs the app with the older 6.1 look (which I want) and the other runs the app with the new 7.1 look. 

I would like to make sure that there is no way I can deliver (or even test) the app with the 7.1 look. I have already once made the mistake of delivering the app with a 7.1 interface. It was a disaster and I would like to make very sure that I don’t do it again. 

I cannot seem to find a way to lock Xcode into the 6.1 SDK such that the 7.1 app version does not appear on my target list. I have no confidence that I cannot build a version with the 7.1 look.

Is there a way I can lock Xcode into building the app only with the 6.1 look, and that will remove the 7.1 target from my list?

Description: 
    
    
                    
I've got the newest Scala IDE (3.0.2) and I want to compile my stuff with Scala 2.9.3.  I've added that version of Scala as a Maven dependency and removed the default 2.10.0 that the IDE bundles with the new project (not my system Scala version, by the way!).  The IDE then tells me Scala is not on the build path, even when I add in the jars to the build path.  When I try to add a "Scala Library" through that dialogue, it doesn't give me any options and adds 2.10.0.  I've gone through the project settings, and would have expected to see a "Scala version" option, but there isn't (only a "Java version" option.)

I am using Visual Studio and adding reference to the project. I can find that there is a folder called References and i add the dll's or Projects to it.

Before build if i wanted to move it, which physical path or part of coding can i find the references. 

After Build i can find that the references are converted to dll's but wanted to know before build, if it is stored somewhere. IF so where is it stored?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Project references are stored in your project file.  For example in my .csproj

&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;ProjectReference Include="..\MyOtherProject\MyOtherProject.csproj"&gt;
    &lt;Project&gt;{9deefd25-a349-4244-b123-ed66927e7414}&lt;/Project&gt;
    &lt;Name&gt;MyOtherProject&lt;/Name&gt;
  &lt;/ProjectReference&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;


You can view your project file by opening it in another text editor, or by right clicking on it in VS and clicking Unload Project.  Then right click on the unloaded project and click Edit.  When you're done looking, right click and click Reload.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you are adding a project reference to another project and then you physically (or manually) move this project to another location (by copy/paste) then you will need to update the reference in your project. But, don't worry even if you fail to remember to update the reference Visual Studio will complain about it when compiling. But, if the reference is an assembly reference, then a copy will be created in your Refences/*bin* folder.

I work with multiple monitors and I like to use several Eclipse windows and move the editors using drag and drop.

In the last versions (4.2+) I can't make this feature to work again.

For example in Kepler when I drag a editor it appears in a new small window, but without the  menus (File/Edit/Run/etc) and toolbars.

How can I make drag and drop to work again like in previous version?

Title: WingIDE AppEngine breakpoints not working when launching from dev_appserver.py
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have attempted to sign up for the WingWare mailing list, but have not received approval yet, so I will post here.

I have been a WingIDE (pro) user for nearly 4 years, and it has worked really well for me. Up until recently, my project was Django-based and running on Google App Engine. Debugging and setting breakpoints worked (and continues to work for that project) perfectly.

A few days ago, I started a new project that will be running on the App Engine, but that will run using the standard dev_appserver.py  (no Django) as the entry point. This runs fine, and I can set breakpoints within the dev_appserver and the associated code, however, I cannot trigger breakpoints within my application code (even though the application runs correctly from the IDE environment). In other words, I can trigger breakpoints within the "Google" code, but within my "custom" code breakpoints are not triggered even though I can see that the code is executing correctly.

I have followed the instructions from http://www.wingware.com/doc/howtos/google-app-engine, and I have tried this even with the simplest app (helloworld.py - from https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/helloworld) and it does not allow me to set breakpoints in the custom files.

I am running WingIDE 5.0.0-1 on OSX Mavericks, with AppEngine SDK 1.8.6.1041.

Any idea what is happening, and how should I go about fixing this? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
It may work to use old_dev_appserver.py instead of dev_appserver.py.  The new dev_appserver.py sets up the environment in a way that breaks all Python debuggers that don't implement extra GAE-specific functionality.

Title: Cursor Placement and &ldquo;Smart Semicolons&rdquo; in MonoDevelop
Description: 
    
    
                    
i'm trying to get MonoDevelop to a less obnoxious state. i'm coming from FlashDevelop, which is like buttah.

In MD, i've checked the option to "Insert matching brace", but it kills me that the caret/cursor is placed between the resulting braces instead of at the end of them:

DoStuff(|)


(where | is my cursor) Since i'm constantly forgetting brackets, i like to set up all of my braces ahead of time, and fill in the content later.  So i'll often type 

function DoStuff()
{
}|


all in one go. Ideally, the IDE will close my round brace and then the curly one, and my cursor will wind up after that final curly brace.  But with MonoDevelop, i wind up with the cursor inside the round braces as soon as i type them.  It's aggravating.

Is there a way to force MD to place the cursor after the closing brace (other than turning this feature off and manually typing both braces)?

Also, i have "Smart semicolon placement" checked.  If i type

DoStuff()


i'd expect a semicolon to be automatically placed at the end of that line.  But it's not. Not so smart, if you ask me.  Where are these clever semicolons supposed to appear?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you enabled 'Smart semicolon placement' just type it inside the braces and the semicolon will jump to the end of the line automatically.
So you would type DoStuff(; and get DoStuff();

I am generating and deploying a WAR file to GAE, but I'm not sure how it's constructing the WAR.  Is there any way to view the compiled WAR in Codenvy?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you look in the IDE, the Output tab will list a snapshot link that allows you to download the WAR file created as well as the other build artifacts.

It will look something like: http://builder.codenvycorp.com/repository/com/codenvy/testapp/1.0-SNAPSHOT

and list out all of your recent build artifacts
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you look in the IDE, but in the Builder tab, in te most upper left there is a link with label "Artifact" thats points to your generated war.

To change name of folder or file NET-BEANS and ECLIPSE IDE both offer an option i.e. REFRACTOR    

What actually is the core purpose of this option? or other way around how can we get benefit from this option while development

PLEASE explain it with some hello word type example.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Refactoring is a major feature in agile software development. It came about as the third step in test-driven development: 


Write a test
Write enough code to pass the test
Refactor


To refactor means the code is working, but it needs to be cleaned up to be more maintainable and extensible. This could be something simple like renaming a variable or extracting common code into a function or something complicated like extracting an interface or adding a design pattern.

I don't have numbers, but I think the majority of developers don't do TDD. Still, you should refactor often to clean up technical debt (another agile term) and make your code maintainable and extensible. It is such a huge help when you need to add a bunch of new features in a short amount of time.

So all these IDE's, regardless of language or platform, offer automated refactorings to make your life easier. For example, changing a method name in a Java class and then changing it everywhere it is referenced would be a huge pain to do manually.

Hope that helps.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
According to here:


  "Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a
  way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet
  improves its internal structure."


The most common usages for this is usually the renaming of variables to something which makes more sense, the fixing of indentations and addition of comments, such as JavaDoc/nDoc.

In certain scenario, one would also require to rewrite some logic, or entire modules of the code. This usually entails either a bad design or else, that the solution had been changed so much that a re-write will ease any future maintenance.
    
    
Title: seleinum IDE WebDriver playback - IE driver - Not getting any of my actions recorded?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to use seleinum IDE to record scripts from the Internet Explorer browser. 

I'm using this documentation: WebDriver Playback in Selenium IDE is Here which is linked directly in the seleinum IDE UI.

Here are the steps I followed:


Install seleinum IDE plugin
Activate WebDriver playback in Seleinum IDE options
Restart Firefox and Seleinum IDE.
Installed selenium-server-standalone-2.35.0.jar 
Installed IEDriverServer_Win32_2.35.3
Ran java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.35.0.jar -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=IEDriverServer.exe -port 8099
Went to localhost:8099/wd/hub
Create session using internet explorer
IE window appears


At this point I expected that I would be able to go to the Internet Explorer window and have my commands captured by the Seleinum IDE, but that is not the case. 

Am I doing something wrong? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The IDE only records in Firefox, but has the ability to playback into IE.

Your answer is therefore to record the initial test in Firefox, and use the server (as you are already), to play it back.

I know how to verify if a specific text is present in a web page using Selenium IDE. But what I wanted to know is, can you verify that any text is present in an element?

For example there's a text box with the title "Top Champion". This text box will be changed daily with the name of a person. Now I just wanted to check whether there is a text in this text box, no matter what the text actually is. I've tried the verify text command and tried blanking the value, but it doesn't work. If the command can return a true or false command that would be really helpful

BTW, verify value doesn't work either since the element that I'm testing is not a form field
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Your best bet is as follows (I have written single tests for this for numbers)

Medium rigour:

waitForText | css=.SELECTORS | regex:.+?


This will wait until there is at least 1 character present.

Strong rigour (only works if you have a subset of characters present):

waitForText | css=.SELECTORS | regex:^[0-9]+$


This will wait until there is text. This text must start with a number, have at least 1 number, and then finish. It does not permit any character outside of the subset given. An example you could do to match numbersNAMEnumbers would be.

waitForText | css=.SELECTORS | regex:^[0-9]+[a-zA-Z]+[0-9]+$


This would wait for a string such as 253432234BobbySmith332

IntelliJ must be running the tests in a different working directory than in the command line.

What I would do is make sure that the command-line mvn succeeds by moving the log directory (and any other resources) to the appropriate directory.  Back in IntelliJ, you can specify the working directory to be used.  Use the same working directory as the working directory where mvn succeeds.

Please update to Spyder 2.2.3, it's much more stable and it'll fix your problem. For that just go to our Downloads page and use our Windows installer.

Notes:


Use #%% to separate file sections for evaluation (a la Matlab cells), instead of selecting every time the portion you want to send to the console.
Please install IPython to ease this task. IPython comes now not only with a command line interface but also with a graphical one which we embedded in Spyder to take advantage of its multiple facilities (like multine inputs) which in this case will let you evaluate file portions much more easily.

Cloud9 has the nvm node version manager pre-installed. These are the steps I used to change the version of Node that runs when you click "Run" for a file.

$ mkdir /home/ubuntu/.nvm/versions
$ nvm install 0.12.0
$ nvm alias default 0.12.0


Why the mkdir? Probably because the nvm support is "rudimentary". Anyway, that's what worked for me.

I am relatively new to Selenium. We are using the Selenium IDE to do some regression testing. I have a menu bar that has different buttons on it that will drop down a menu when you hover over any of the buttons (there are 4 buttons on the menu bar). So when i select one of the menu items from the dropdown, it opens a page inside the same window. This page looking at the debug info in Selenium seems to be a frame. This frame open right under the menu bar and the menu bar is still visible. Once the page has loaded completely, I want to go outside the frame and click on a button on the menu bar and click on the next item to verify. This doesnt seem to work, once the page (frame) has loaded then nothing happens. I have tried using window focus, select frame, mouse over commands but nothing seem to work. i have also used the relative = parent and relative = top commands with the select frame command but cant get it to work.

Any tips or suggestions are welcome. If I am not clear on the description I can provide more details. Thanks for the assist.

If the control is outside of the frame Selenium is pointing to, then you need to switch back to default content, and possibly switch to the frame the control is in.

Driver.SwitchTo().DefaultContent();
Driver.SwitchTo().Frame(frameID);

you should firstly switch to appropriate frame where your button is located in:

1. Switch to frame
Command: selectFrame
Target: your_frame_id

2. Click button
Command: click
Target: your_button_id (or you can use XPath or CSS selector instead)

is there an IDE for the Go language that can easily deploy/upload files to the server?

ideally I am looking for an IDE that can automatically upload the files to the server each time I decide to run the app, like I can do with PyCharm for python

You could use IntelliJ IDEA, now it has working Go plugin, to build the latest plugin, visit this tutorial.

I use LiteIDE for editing, and command line appcfg.py for uploading. If you are not familiar with command line, here is a quick sample:

appcfg.py update your_app_folder --oauth2


Just save this string somewhere and copy and paste to CMD when you need it.

Title: Eclipse IDE Redo and Inspect key command Conflicts
Description: 
    
    
                    
This is really irritating me , Am using Eclipse IDE(JUNO) In Apple MacBook Pro Mountain Lion for my project development, 
whenever i press Cmd + Shift + z instead of redo action , i am getting an popup in bottom right corner like below,



i even tried to change the key comands in Eclipse =&gt; Preferences =&gt; General =&gt; Keys , but nothing is working, always getting this popup.

Does anyone have any solution for this?

I've been suffering with this issue too and just found the solution:

With Eclipse not running, edit org.eclipse.e4.workbench/workbench.xmi and search for 'COMMAND+SHIFT+Z'.  You'll find two &lt;bindings&gt; instances -  one pertains to Redo and one to Inspect.  You'll need to do a search on the command="xxxx" attribute to do a lookup to see which one belongs to the &lt;commands&gt; with elementId="org.eclipse.ui.edit.redo" and which one belongs to the one with elementId="org.eclipse.php.debug.ui.commands.Inspect".

Once you've determined which &lt;bindings&gt; is for Inspect, change its keySequence to something other than 'COMMAND+SHIFT+Z' to remove the conflict.

:-)

I had a similar issue with shortcuts. Have you restarted Eclipse after updating the key bindings be to non-conflicting? That was needed for me, but after that, it was consistently working.

Looking at http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/ it appears that:


eric 4 is targeting python2
eric 5 is targeting python3


And then looking at http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=eric you'll see that eric, as packaged for Ubuntu, is only version 4 - meaning you've got one choice if you want to use eric right now:


Compile eric 5 from source so you can do some python 3 programming, or
Stay with eric 4 and python 2, if you feel more comfortable with precompiled packages.

    
    
Title: Why does NetBeans recreate &ldquo;old&rdquo; packages&#39; folders on deploy?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Working with a java web application in NetBeans I've refactored my packages several times. Now when the IDE builds the project, I find empty folders with the names of "old" packages in build\web\WEB-INF\classes\. Saying "old" I mean those packages I have already deleted, moved or renamed. 

I've looked through all the files in the application folder, searching for these "old" names, but failed to find any occurance at all. Where does NetBeans take it from? 

I should add, that these folders are created on Deploy command, not Build. So probably it's Apache Tomcat...
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Examining the output window of the IDE, I found that while deploying it used configuration from c:\Users\&lt;current user&gt;\.netbeans\7.0\var\. In this directory I found cache folder and removed it. Also I deleted my project's build folder. 

After rebuilding and deploying, IDE created folders for the existing packages only. I do hope that this is it and those old ones were stored in the IDE cache I deleted.

P.S.: before removing the cache folder, one should close the IDE, or it may have problems while closing the open solutions.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I have dealt with this before. If clean and build doesn't fix it. I am sure creating a new project and moving all your .form and .java files from SRC into your new projects SRC will fix it.

I am not sure why netbeans does that but it is finicky when editing Package folders because netbeans needs this written down somewhere in its program to compile from CMD Line and all that jazz.
