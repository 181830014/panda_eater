Title: Can I code for Visual C++ and Visual Basic on Ubuntu?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I want to change my OS to Ubuntu, but I have pending projects in Visual C++ and Visual Basic. 

I have not worked with Ubuntu before, so will I be able to carry forward my pending work to Ubuntu? Will it work with the IDEs available in Ubuntu?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
IDEs on Linux are generally for projects that work on Linux. If your projects use anything specific to MS (and Visual Basic is one such thing), you won't be able to work on them under Linux-specific IDEs. Even your C++ code might be using many Windows-specific tools, like MFC, C++/CLI or managed extensions, COM... Windows has lots of non-standard, non-portable things. So, answering your question: probably no.

You can install Visual Studio under Linux with Wine, but it will probably be an unpleasant experience: Visual Studio is a big application that strongly integrates with Windows, and Wine might not be able to emulate Windows well enough.

I would advice you to keep Windows until your work on these projects will be finished, dual-boot (install Ubuntu on another partition and boot it when you don't need to work on your projects) or install Windows in a virtual machine inside Linux (f.e. using VMWare Player or VirtualBox). I chose last option and with VMWare it is good enough for me.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The best options would be:


to use the wine emulator;
to install windows in a virtual machine (with VirtualBox);
to use MonoDevelop.

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If those projects are targeted at Windows deployment, then you really ought to be developing them, or at least testing them, on Windows. That said, you could use a virtual machine to keep running Windows for work on those projects, and use Ubuntu otherwise.

If you decide to do this, I can't recommend making backups (plural!) highly enough before starting, in case you need to back out.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
You can use WINE and run Visual Studio's on Ubuntu, the best option before a total conversion is to dual boot between windows and linux.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Visual C++: maybe.  Depends on what kind of project it is.  If it doesn't involve GUIs or MS-specific technologies like COM, .NET and company, you can probably port it with a minimum of effort.  If it involves GUIs and/or MS-specific technologies, no it won't be portable.

Visual Basic: There is REALBasic which is claimed to be "like Visual Basic", but I'm rather dubious of its compatibility.  (Whenever I see the words "migration tool" I get very nervous.)

That being said, you don't have to leave Windows completely behind these days.  You can run WINE (if you really like pain -- I've never had WINE accomplish anything useful), or you can dual-boot or you can use something like VirtualBox to run Windows under Linux, all depending on your available resources and inclinations.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
Sounds like you did not try it out: it won't work even with WINE it'll be a pain. To try out what will work or not install a virtual machine with Ubuntu as an OS under your current OS. YOu will be able to test things without breaking something.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
I would suggest looking at the Mingw32 system.  I have had excellent luck compiling Win32 applications (in C and C++) on a Linux system.  So long as you're using the public Win32 API (basically, anything in windows.h), Mingw32 is a reasonably good choice.

You will probably not be able to use your Visual Studio solutions in Linux.  Linux tends to avoid IDEs in favor of a system called Autotools.  Having used both for many years, I have to say that on balance I prefer Autotools.

There is a steep learning curve involved in Autotools, but I feel the payoff is worth it.  Good luck!
    
    
Title: Java IDEs Null Pointer Alerts
Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there an IDE or IDE plugin that would alert the developer for a possible NPE? For example:

Object[] x = getMyObjects();

if (x.length &gt; 0){

   // do my stuff

}


It would be nice if the IDE alerts that x is not checked for a possible null value. It would save many engineering hours..
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is something that FindBugs can detect among many other usefull things. There is also a Eclipse plugin available.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
NullPointerExceptions are programming errors by nature. 

What could you do if the given array is null? A. skip the check. A better alternative would be to return an empty array:

public Object [] getMyObjects() {
     /// do a lot of stuff 

    if( nothingToReturn() ){
        return new Object[0];
     } else {
         return nonNullArray;
     }
}


So

if( x.length &gt; 0 ) 


Never throws Npe in first place.

Although It would be nice, very soon you'll realize your code will be unreadable. 

That's why "encapsulation" is such an important concept in OOP ( that way other object's won't nullify your data ) .

I think it's fair to check if external classes return null or not ( which by the way should be well documented ) but for internal methods, the real problem is, the own object doesn't know the state of its own instance variables.

NOTE This was too large for a comment, that's why I provided a CW answer instead.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You might want to start with adding the FindBugs plugin to check for this kind (and many more) bugs on every save. And if you haven't already, add the CheckStyle plugin too :-)

in addition to John's answer...



Eclipse 3.4 gave me an excellent message, which was something like :


  The variable can only be null at this point.


I couldn't believe it at first, but it was true.
It was two expressions like :

if ((var == null) &amp;&amp; (var.getProperty().equals("")) {

if ((var != null) || (var..getProperty().equals("")) {

Eclipse 3.5 (and AFAIR 3.4, too) has two compiler options for Nullpointers.

You can find them at Window -code/code

Description: 
    
    
                    
I've been using Komodo Edit for a small project in Django.

The code completion features seem to work pretty well for standard python modules, however, it doesn't know anything about Django modules.   Is there any way to configure Komodo Edit to use Django modules for autocomplete as well?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
By sure Django is on your python path and Komodo should pick it up. Alternatively you can add the location of Django to where Komodo looks for its autocomplete.

You can install a Django extension in Komodo edit. I haven't tested it myself but you can test it.

Title: Can JDK version be specified in source code?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm developing a Java app on two different computers (same source code) that have different JDK versions. Is there a way to specify JDK version in the source code so that an IDE (e.g. NetBeans) will compile the source code the same way on both machines?

One of my computers has JDK5 and the other has JDK6. Under 5, jdbc-interface doesn't support some methods (e.g. NClob, XML...) which are available in 6, so code that gets compiled on the 6 machine works while code compiled on the 5 machine doesn't. Right now, I have to comment out 6-only stuff when working on the 5 machine.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Not in the source code. You want to set your IDE to compile using a Java 5 JDK. You can do this by installing a Java 5 JDK alongside the Java 6 JDK, and specifying that (which is IDE dependent).

Alternatively, if you're using Ant, you can specify the Java version in the javac task.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Don't overcomplicate the issue... install the same version of the JDK on all the machines, and set your IDEs to use that version. Ignore other versions.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I know this has been answered but if you cant update the 1.5 to 1.6 then all you need to do is set the ide that is using 1.6 to compile to "source compatibility" of 1.5 

There is no need to install the 1.5 on the machine that is running 1.6 because the JDK is backward compatible. 

The setting in eclipse is preferences 
Answer 4: 

    
    
You'll always have to regress to and code against the lowest version of the JDK - in your case you can't use the features introduced in JDK version 6.

As Brian has said, it's probably safest if you work with the IDE configured to use the same JDK (version 5 in your case).

You can switch to a particular runtime version using the version argument, but that's probably not going to help in you.  

Also note, compiling your code against version 6 and running against version 5 will cause runtime error due the incompatible class versions, when as you stated you try to use JDBC methods that didn't exist in the older version.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
In NetBeans you have right click on project properties then source version if you have jdk 1.6 you can build it with previous versions
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
What you need to do is specify the source compatibility to something that's supported by both JDKs (&lt;= 1.5). It may make sense to go lower than 1.5 if, for instance the application you're building may be deployed to an environment that only has Java 1.3 installed.

I know this is possible in Eclipse, but unfortunately, I'm not familiar with NetBeans, but I'm sure it would be possible too.

If it's any help, here's how you do it if you're just running javac from the console (assuming you want 1.5 as your base level):

javac -source 1.5 ...


This is also possible as a plug in configuration within a Maven POM, if you're using Maven (which I understand NetBeans has excellent support for). This is how you'd do that (from http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/examples/set-compiler-source-and-target.html):

&lt;project&gt;
  [...]
  &lt;build&gt;
    [...]
    &lt;plugins&gt;
      &lt;plugin&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;configuration&gt;
          &lt;source&gt;1.4&lt;/source&gt;
          &lt;target&gt;1.4&lt;/target&gt;
        &lt;/configuration&gt;
      &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
    [...]
  &lt;/build&gt;
  [...]
&lt;/project&gt;


And as Brian Agnew points out, possible in Ant also.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Problem is: do you need to support JVM 1.5? If so, your code should be fully 1.5-compatible (which doesn't seem to be). If not, just update your JVM in all your machines (as already suggested) to same JVM version (and don't forget version minor: 1.6.0_03 != 1.6.0_14).
    
    
Title: Is Visual Studio also a good IDE for non .NET languages?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm a bit in IDE trouble, and I'm not alone I have noticed, still I haven't found an answer on many of my questions. 

I would very much stop using different editors and become very good at one (on windows),  adhering the pragmatic adage : "Learn one editor (ide) well".  I' m willing to put in a lot of effort, to gain on the long term.  

I have programmed (java) with Intellij and Eclipse, and am progamming c# now.  (VS08 was at first very disappoing for me, till so at SOF mentioned Resharper and now I'm very happy with it,  especially since I started writing macros for further adjustments)

For all purpose editors, VIM and EMACS come to mind, but I'm afraid they just cannot compete against VS08/Resharper when it comes to C#, which I'm using a lot on this moment.  Further, it isn't clear to me if they support refactoring (after installing packages for the language in question?)

But since VS08/Resharper is so powerfull for c#, I would like to give VS a serious chance.  But for that it should have support for langauges that don't compile to CIL.

hence my question : Is Visual Studio a good tool for non .NET languages?

(and like asked on the side : how about refactoring in VIM/EMACS?)
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
VS is IMO, better then average editor but not something you can't live without.

If you like your editor to open as fast as Notepad with bunch of features, try EditPlus (on the down side it uses older RegExp implementation but on the plus side it can be made to be portable.

If you would like total extensibility, fast startup, inovative fatures, integrated reposity etc.. try E-Editor, windows port of Mac TextMate.

VIM is ofc superb, but ... long learning curve may be a problem and some people can't find themselves in 2 mode editors.

About Resharper... mhm... almost all of its non-code analytic features may be integrated in mentioned editors. For its suggestive features I doubt there is alternative. I disabled it for the moment because I tend to let Resharper fill in my holes so it can be  a double bladed sword - sonner or latter I will totally stop thinking about some things like, can this variable be null or can I move its declaration. I run resharper once I finished some working procedure or at the very end to polish the code.

I personaly use EditPlus for all of the NON MS languages, but E-Editor got my attention recently.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I tend to avoid using IDEs outside of the languages they are designed. A dedicated IDE can include class libraries, function references, code completion utilities, etc. out of the box. 

Once you step outside that, however, you have a clunky and resource hungry text-editor. You might as well use a text editor in that case just to keep your workstation nimble. 

It might be better not to learn one IDE well, but rather a text editor. I've used jEdit for years for several reasons: It's multiplatform, includes syntax highlighting for lots of languages, and can be feature-extended with plugins. It's become one of my standard tools, but it's only one in the box. 
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
How about VI mode for VS? I think Eclipse has one too. 

You'll just have to learn vi-related commands, but will be able to work in, C# (with VS), Java (with Eclipse), C++ (with VS or Eclipse), scripting languages (with vi), ...
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
"I would very much stop using different editors and become very good at one (on windows),"

Why?

"adhering the pragmatic adage : "Learn one editor (ide) well". "  Really?  How is this pragmatic?

After 30 years in this business, my lesson learned is "tools come and go."

Once upon a time we had big fights over vi vs emacs.  Not vim with syntax coloring, but plain-text-vi on black-and-white monitors.

Why narrow your world to one tool?  How will you cope with innovation if your tool is not the new state-of-the-art?
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
As far as C/C++ goes, Visual Studio is considered the gold standard (well, Visual Studio + VAX if you really want to get specific). It's not perfect, and it's certainly not as good as the C# tools it has, but it's still a damn sight better than anything else out there, on any platform. (Assuming you didn't want C99 support.)

Of course it doesn't really do non-.NET other than those two.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I think that there is good specialization at the moment.  VS is the clear candidate for .Net, with Resharper and DevExpress as great augmentation for increased productivity.  

Currently we use Aptana for the "Web 2.0" stuff - CSS/jQuery/MooTools, and that has been a great environment as well.  I have avoided the Intellisense in VS 08 for jQuery and do prototyping in HTML/CSS/JS in Apatana, then do all the Domain design in VS.  Works for us pretty well.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
It is good for C/C++ but it is not comparable with what you get for C# or VB.Net ( i don't think it support other languages )

for javascript intelisense is still limited

What's wrong with grep?

grep "^\s*def.*=(\[\]|\{\}|set\(\))"


This will find just about all of the usual culprits.  

If you're using a instance of one of your own mutable classes as a default value, you'll have to check for that separately.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Pylint has a warning for default argument values of mutable types.  It's customizable, so you could get it to just do this if you wanted.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The regex proposed by @S.Lott is also finding function/method calls, but we just want to find function/method definitions.

So here is an updated version of the regex to find the location of all function/method signatures which uses mutable default argument:

def .+?\([^:]*?(=\[\]|=\{\}|set\(\))[^:]*?\):


Note:

if you are using PyCharm, it will add a yellowish background to these arguments and help you change the code.

Title: Which Flash/Actionscript IDE to use &mdash; if one should be used at all?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've always used the built-in IDE, but I've been gone from Flash since ActionScript 2.0 in Flash MX... I'm coming back to Flash, and I notice there's a number of IDE's (some of which cost more than the Flash upgrade). So... question for Flash/Actionscript 3 developers -- which IDE to use, if at all?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Hands down, definitely use an IDE for ActionScript.  We use (and I recommend) Flash Builder 4.

ActionScript 2
In older versions of ActionScript (like Flash MX that you're familiar with), an IDE was not as important.  You could get away with most coding in the Flash Development Environment.  In those days, most code was bundled with the FLA files that created the SWFs.  With ActionScript 3, that changed because unlike AS2, ActionScript 3 is Object-Oriented and this makes all the difference.

ActionScript 3 
Now, the best practice is to have next to zero code in Flash's FLA files.  All code is now external in *.as files and broken into packages.  This was not so much the case in AS2.  Nowadays, 99% of the flash projects I create contain zero actionscript inside the FLA files.  The exception is for occasional animation controls (like stop() or gotoAndPlay()) that sometimes don't make sense outside of the timeline.  Even those, I try my hardest to pull into *.as files whenever possible.  Today, code in a FLA is a sign you're probably doing something wrong.

Why Use An IDE?
Here are several reasons I believe one should use an IDE for ActionScript:



Debugging Possibly the #1 reason to use an IDE: stepping through the code as it's executing live
Stronger Variable Typing
The core actionscript language doesn't require you to specify variable types, return types, etc. It can be very easy to code bugs that are difficult to track down.  An IDE encourages stronger typing by highlighting code and displaying warnings when types are absent
Stronger Error Checking The core language also quietly ignores serious errors. Using only the code editor in Flash MX has generated some painful bugs for me in the past where the root cause was only a typo. The IDE as compared to the Flash Development Environment catches far more bugs at compile time so they don't ever make it into production
Code Completion Code completion is so valuable, I wish I could use an IDE just for this StackOverflow post! I type 50X faster in an IDE because I'm constantly using word completion and expanding macros and templates
Boiler Plate Code IDE's are great for doing all the crap you don't want to do like generating getters/setters for a field, comments, skeleton classes, etc.
API References When you type a method, an IDE will show you the signature of that method so you rarely have to consult online documentation to remember all the properties and methods of a particular class
Plugins Integration with Subversion is absolutely essential to our development process.  IDEs manage this process for you with the help of plugins.  Most essential processes (like unit testing) are supported by IDE extensions that make life easier.
Refactoring Most IDEs have built in, powerful refactoring tools which allow you to change your code easily and correctly
Project-Level Code Management an IDE lets you manage your code from the project level making it much easier to manage dependencies, link libraries, images, assets, css, source code from other projects and more. It also helps with managing annoying settings and preferences that are easy to forget like compiler settings, command line arguments, runtime configurations, etc.
Team Work IDEs are designed to function in the team environment and since they manage your entire project, they make it much easier for multiple people to work on the same set of code. They also encourage conventions, like a project's directory structure, which helps set standards for the community 
Comparison and Navigation Another feature I use a lot is the built in diff/history tools that let me spot differences in code as well as navigation shortcts that let me jump to where a function is declared or search all references to a function
Syntax Highlighting last but not least, one of the obvious IDE benefits that makes code infinitely more skim-able and manageable. I would also lump in with this other visual features like code collapsing, line numbers, icons/alerts in the margians, error/warning highlighting, etc.


That's about all I can think of off the top of my head but I'm sure there are hundreds of other reasons.



Which IDE to Use?

If you or your company has the money, Flash Builder 4.  Hands down.  It is the defacto IDE from Adobe and it's based on a stripped-down version of Eclipse meaning many of the thousands of useful eclipse plugins work without modification (like Subclipse) and it's cross-platform.  Many examples online use Flash Builder and it's hard to go wrong developing with it.  One of the less obvious essential features is it's ground-level integration with BlazeDS and Flex--two things you're certainly going to use as you get back into ActionScript.

If your job is not footing the bill, then more cost effective solutions exist.  FDT is an open source solution for eclipse.  It's pretty good but it lacks the robust suite of features in Flash Builder, most notably the ability to debug code that's running in the browser.

I hope all this helps in some way,

Answer 2: 

    
    
There is Flash Develop, which is free and good enough. If you are willing to pay, or if you'd be doing Flex development too, Flash Builder from Adobe (the erstwhile Flex Builder) is the best choice..

If all you care about is syntax highlighting, and you don't like the CS3 ide, Notepad++ will do it for you.

I'd suggest powerflasher's eclipse plugin FDT or jetbrains IDEA IDE
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I have always used a plain text editor to write AS code (in both AS2 and AS3.) I tend to use TextPad on windows (mainly out of habit as the shortcuts are now seemingly built into my fingers) and TextMate in Mac OS, each with relevant syntax highlighting installed. Note that personally I don't find debugging anywhere near as important as syntax highlighting &amp; autospacing, so this pattern won't suit everyone!

I then either run an instance of Flash CS4 in the background (at work, where I have the license) or just run flex build scripts from a shortcut or terminal (when at home and without the flash license.)

A quick tip if you are coding these scripts yourself - you can build pure actionscript applications using the flex builder if you just run

$ mxmlc DocumentClass.as

and use that file's constructor as entry point, and import all your packages from subfolders from there. This pattern has pretty much replaced my need for a trial version of flash and an empty FLA in AS3 now. I mention this as it is seemingly undocumented, and all Adobe documentation implies that you need an mxml base file somewhere.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I've always used Flex/Flash Builder for Actionscripting. I hear that CS5 has better integration between Flash Builder and Flash, so if you need to work in both it has a nice workflow.

Your question is correctly tagged - you need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)! Dreamweaver wants to be one but unfortunately it isn't.

If you're on a Mac I highly recommend Coda.

For any platform; I've had a great experience with Aptana (a fork of Eclipse) and these open-source IDEs are just bursting with useful plugins. Even Aptana's default project templates were useful instead of fluff!

One guy in my team loves NetBeans to bits.

Right now I'm addicted to shelling into the server and using command-line tools like vi or nano, svn, mysql. A steep (and important) learning curve but everything is possible on the command line. And with minimal client requirements. Do anything from anywhere!

I think the true answer is subjective - you'll need to dive in and try each one to see how they fit your working style.

Hope that helps!

Description: 
    
    
                    
Every once in a while this drives me crazy: I want to move a control to some precise location, WITHOUT any kind of "snapping" -- snap-to-grid, snap-to-guidelines, snap-to-border, etc... and Delphi won't let me. Is there a key combination that one can use while dragging to temporarily turn off any and all "snapping"?  I seem to recall it being available in D6, but can't for the life of me find a similar combination in D2007, short of going into Tools -/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
In Delphi 2009 CodeGear has changed the behavior of ALT+Move to also disable the designer guide lines. But in Delphi 2007 this feature can't be turned off without an external tool.

On of those tools (and I think the only that can do this) is the DDevExtensions 1.6 IDE plugin that adds this ability to ALT+Move for Delphi 2007.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Drag with the Alt key down to disable snapping to the grid. Snapping to objects will remain in effect. You can use Ctrl with the arrow keys to move one pixel at a time. You can also type the desired coordinates into the Object Inspector.

What is a good compiler and/or IDE for C that runs on modern Windows systems? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you are building pure Windows apps nothing beats Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. There is a free Version as well. There is also Bloodshed Dev-C++ that can compile C, but it isn't nearly as well documented or a feature rich as any of the versions Visual Studio, but it is useful in building things that originated on POSIX/*NIX systems, because it uses the MinGW compiler. Eclipse also has a plug-in for C and C++, but again it isn't as well documented as Visual Studio. Netbeans has C and C++ support as well. The caveat with Eclipse and Netbeans is they run on the JVM and will need lots of RAM to perform well, but with "modern" Windows systems this should not be an issue.

Title: Is it possible to add &ldquo;assert&rdquo; as a keyword in Delphi?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I write couple of "assert(...)" in code, to make sure that pre- and post-conditions should be satisfied. We can tell the Delphi compiler, whether to compile with assertions in a debug version and without assertions in a release version. 

I would like to know, if it is possible, to highlight "assert" like other Pascal keywords?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Assert, like many other seemingly "reserved words" are actually what are called "standard functions"

Exit, Break, Continue, and Assert are examples of symbols that are not reserved by the compiler, but rather exist as symbols within the "System" unit namespace. The reason is that Delphi (or more specifically Turbo Pascal) originally didn't have the notion of Exit, Break, Continue or Assert. Many existing users may have already used those identifiers for their own libraries. Had we made these identifiers reserved words, we'd have broken many existing applications. By creating them as "standard functions" and "scoping" them to the System unit, we could provide the added functionality without the risk of breaking existing code. In some library that has, say, its own Exit function, the program's use of that identifier would not be affected. However if the programmer explicitly wanted to use the Exit standard function, you can fully qualify the identifier like this "System.Exit" and the compiler will generate code to exit the current function rather than calling the Exit that is closer in scope.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Actually Assert is not a reserved word.
You can create your own Assert procedure or function and even though it's not recommended, it will compile.
Therefore no highlighting is possible with Assert.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
No. Delphi's highlighter is not configurable like that. You can configure the color of keywords, but you cannot configure what words count as keywords.

If you meant this question as a feature request, then please submit it to Embarcadero's Quality Central. Stack Overflow is not the venue for that.

Since you're checking preconditions and postconditions, your assertions should be pretty easy to find even without highlighting: They'll be the first and last statements in any function.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I always type the exit function in CAPITALS to make it stand out. you could try the same with assert.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I don't think so.  Under Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Editor Options -&gt; Source Options, you can turn syntax highlighting on or off, but there's no option I can see that lets you define what syntax to highlight.

you would use the interactive form:

(defun go-to-url (url)
  (interactive "sURL: ")
  (do-your-stuff url))


This way you can use go-to-url both in your lisp and with M-x: go-to-url and you'll be prompted for the argument.

See also my reply to your other question: Emacs: Is there a way to create a interactive script using Emacs?
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There is a function that does this already `browse-url', which will prompt you to browse the url at point or you can edit/create one. 

For functions that take numeric arguments you can also use C-u then type the value you want passing to the command you execute. 
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
In Icicles, during any minibuffer use (with completion or not) you can hit a key to insert a string that was saved in  a variable or a register.


For a register, hit C-x r i (as usual).
For a string, hit C-=.


By default, the variable used is icicle-input-string, but if you use a prefix arg (i.e., C-u C-=) then you are prompted for the variable to use. Completion candidates include all string-valued variables.

You can save a string (e.g. a complex regexp) to a variable using command icicle-save-string-to-variable. Again, by default the variable is icicle-input-string, but with a prefix arg you are prompted for the variable.

You can also insert a string in the minibuffer at any time by hitting M-: and typing a Lisp sexp to evaluate.  The result is pretty-printed and inserted into the minibuffer.  (In Icicles, M-: opens a recursive minibuffer, and it pretty-prints.)

From your description of what you need, you seem to be looking more for examples or code for writing a full-blown design surface yourself. I am not aware of a suitable library for that.

Does it crash when you do a specific thing? Can you find any log which contains any helpful info?

The information you provided is insufficient to know what the problem is, but as a guideline you should do the following :


Have Visual Studio log its activity for troubleshooting.
Try to uninstall or turn off all addons of the IDE, some plugins can crash the whole IDE, and this is a very common cause of VS crash. or :
Use the /SafeMode option which prevent all addons from being loaded.
Download and install all the available Windows updates.
Download and install all the available updates and hotfixes for Visual Studio.
If nothing worked, you can report this to Microsoft, and wait for their feedback.

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I wrote an article a while back called How to debug crashes and hangs. In it I illustrate how to determine what is Visual Studio doing during a crash, shows how to get a call stack, save a minidump and report a problem to Microsoft. If you file a bug on http://connect.microsoft.com/visualstudio/feedback and attach a call stack and minidump, chances are high that we will be able to help you.

If you'd like to investigate your problem, I suggest you read the article I linked above, get a call stack (with symbols loaded), log a connect bug and attach the call stack and minidump with heap (they will help you to attach a heap since it's a very big file).

Check the lib of your project. It may be that you have include two such jar files in which same class is available or say one class in code can be refrenced in two jar files. In such case also eclipse stops assisting code as it is totally confused.

Better way to check this is go to the file where assist is not working and comment all imports there, than add imports one by one and check at each import if code-assist is working or not.You can easily find the class with duplicate refrences.
    
    
Title: Language Wizards considered harmful?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Wizards can kick-start features. They can also obfuscate your code, and are anti-YAGNI.

On balance, do you think Wizards are more useful or more harmful?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
They are more useful than harmful if and only if you understand the code they generate.
Only after you mastered the problem the wizard is trying to solve they are really useful.
Otherwise you'll hit walls later in the project, because the generated code will need modifications at some point.

"The Law of Leaky Abstractions" really nails it on the head.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
They're there for a reason - to try and make your life easier.
They can be useful and save you 5 or 10 minutes of typing.  Of course it's best to read and make sure you understand what they've written for you.

If you use them without understanding, then they could be considered harmful in the fact that they're letting you get away with not learning something you should probably know, but on balance I think they're a good thing.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Wizards are good if and only if you can get away with never editing the code that they generate.  In that situation, they are in essence a very high level programming language.  When you change your mind about something that was generated by the wizard, you can run the wizard again.

Wizards are most horribly evil if you must ever edit the code that they generate.  If you do this, and later change your mind about one of the choices that you made in the wizard, then you are forced to choose between two very bad options.  You can rerun the wizard, and reapply the manual edits, or you can try to edit the multiple copies of the boilerplate code that the wizard created the first time around.  In the former case, you are likely to forget at least one of your edits, and in the latter case, you are likely to miss at least one of the places in the code that was affected by your choice at wizard running time.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Wizards are "mostly harmless" when they generate an encapsulated entity - a function, a class or a set of classes - which you don't need to modify and which you interact with through a well-defined, well-designed interface.

On the other end of the spectrum is a wizard that that generates skeleton code that needs to be extended and modified. This is especially troublesome if you can't change some of the wizard option later without losing your edits. 

These are still "ok" for the pro who could write the same code by himself and uses the wizard to save time. However, when they are used to make something complicated look easy for beginners, they are a paint job over a rusty car: they help selling something that you otherwise wouldn't buy.

In practice, they may still be useful to ease adoption of a platform. But that's a business aspect, and whether business aspects may justify code blunders is a question of the development environment.

RubyMine is sometimes cited as the best one. Personally, I haven't used it, so I can't comment on it. RubyMine is basically a lean (i.e. without the Java support) version of IntelliJ IDEA with the IDEA Ruby Plugin pre-installed.

I have always used the NetBeans Ruby Plugin and have been somewhat satisfied with it.

Now, if you have experience with IDEs for other dynamic languages such as Lisp or Smalltalk, then all of the Ruby IDEs, whether that be RubyMine, Eclipse RDT, Eclipse DLTK/Ruby, Ruby in Steel, RadRails or 3rd Rail, or "IDEs" such as Vim, Emacs, TextMate, Sublime, etc. will feel like primitive stone age tools in comparison.

Do you mean code folding?  If so, the "project desktop" autosave option controls whether your current folding information is saved.  With the option on it will keep your code foldings set to how they were when you last used the project.
    
    
Title: Are there any ide&#39;s out there with good support for vim/vi bindings?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Finding vim plugin maintenance and configuring is too laborious and relies on external configurations (such as ruby) tricky. What I want is an IDE like Eclipse, Visual Studio, that I can use vim in.  I still want to be able to use different modes (command, visual, insert), but I don't want these inbuilt commands to conflict with the IDE's commands. 

I've heard PIDA is good for this but looks like a bit of a mission to configure on Mac.

I use Komodo Edit on OS X, Ubuntu and Windows. It's open source, supports a ton of languages and has good Vi/Vim key binding support without getting in the way of itself. It's also easy to add in support for additional key bindings. It's built on the Mozilla code base and can be extended with Add-ons (Remote Drive Tree/Source Tree/MoreKomodo are great examples). I also personally love being able to write macros for myself in either JS or Python to add extra functionality.

The full fledged IDE is worth looking at if you can use the extra features. For most of the things that I work on, I can't use a full fledged remote debugger so Komodo Edit suits my needs. 

It also has built in SSH support all in a package that is very responsive on my 5 year old work machine with several 1000 line files open in tabs.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I've just started learning C on Mac OS X. I have downloaded Xcode too.

So far, I have been typing my apps into TextEdit, and then using the Terminal to locate my apps and compile them using gcc hello.c etc.

Is there an easier way (using Xcode perhaps?) to type my code into some form of IDE, and then automate the compiling with a 'compile and run' button or similiar? It seems a bit primitive and tedious using TextEdit and then switching to the Terminal to compile. However, I do not have much experience with lower level languages like C, so I'm unsure if it is even possible.

Thanks
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes that is what XCode is for. 

Look at the tutorial on the open screen of XCode (version 3.2.1 for OSX 10.6) This is for objective C but the tools are the same.

Or if the objective C is confusing choose a new project from XCode. File-/p/div
Answer 2: 

    
    
Xcode will definitely be easier, although for a "hello world"-type project like yours, its advantages may not be obvious. Install it, fire it up, and leave TextEdit behind ...

OTOH, you could edit your source code in vi or emacs (in Terminal), which would avoid having to flip between Terminal and TextEdit. BTW, this is the way development used to be done ...

I'm learning Objective-C and my friend have a real Macintosh IIci, that uses a Mac System 7(specifically 7.5.5 with a 68k processor) and I've installed Metrowerks C/C++ IDE(I think it's the version 1, but I don't know), but i didn't tested it, then i want to know one thing: It's possible to develop in Objective-C using NSObjects/Objects and AppKit or something like this on it? Thanks.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The short answer, as Stephen says, is no. But, just for fun, I started thinking about what you'd have to do to actually make that work. 

1) You'd have to make gcc run on the 68k (gcc is the compiler that speaks Objective-C; you could probably substitute llvm for gcc, but let's not get too crazy). This is no mean feat. A quick look at the latest gcc builds does not show anything for that platform (unsurprisingly). I'm not an expert on gcc, but I bet it uses gcc-specific extensions and modern C so getting it to compile with an existing 68k compiler will probably be a non-starter. 

So the first step for this will be adding an 68k back-end to gcc. This will allow gcc to spit out code that will run on a 68k. You could then use an x86 build of gcc with 68k support to cross-compile a new gcc binary that will actually run on your ancient Mac. 

Having never messed with gcc before, I suspect that this task would take me about two-three years. Maybe more. but still, it's not impossible. 

2) Once you've got a modern version of gcc that you can run on your 68k machine, you can use it to cross-compile for x86 or PPC. (Since you're talking about AppKit, you will never be able to actually RUN any of these programs on your old computer. All testing will have to take place on a more modern machine.) You now have to get all of the libraries and headers for Cocoa/Foundation/AppKit/libc/etc from your target machine (a PPC or x86 Mac) and put them somewhere that the gcc on your 68k can find. This will probably take a good 6 months of finagling to get right. But again, it shouldn't be impossible. 

It might not be legal, though. As far as I know, the license agreements for OS X (which contains Cocoa) and Xcode will not let you move those binaries around willy-nilly to any machine you want. You would want to speak to a competent attorney before doing this as no one wants to get a visit from Interpol. 

3) I think you're done at this point. You can write Objective-C/Cocoa code on your Mac IIci, compile it for a PPC or x86 Mac, ship it off to an OS X box using your favorite method (I've only been a Mac guy since 2005 so I don't even know the connectivity options on the IIci), and test and debug it rather painfully. 

At this point, you have access to a Mac running OS X on either a PPC or x86 chip. And you will wonder why you don't just do all your development on THIS machine instead. And since you've spent a few years getting your IIci development environment set up, buying an old PPC Mac for development will be cheap. 

Still, it could be a fun idea. It'd probably get you on the reddit front page if you pulled it over. (Though, honestly, it'd be easier to just fake it for YouTube if that's all you're after.)
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Short answer: no.

Objective-C became the lingua franca of mac development with OS X, which went into beta 10 years or so after that computer shipped.  Most development for pre- OS X systems was done with C or C++.

Without OS X, you won't have any of the system libraries or headers to link against, and the Metrowerks compiler won't know anything about the Objective-C syntax or runtime extensions to C.

To top it off, the Objective-C frameworks are built for PowerPC (or now, Intel) macs, whereas the processor in that machine uses the older 68k architecture.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
gcc was still being compiled for 68k Amiga in the early noughties, so there might be some chance to get it working on 68k Mac OS. I believe Objective C extension were available from at least the early 90s for gcc.

Another option is to use 68k Linux. There is an port of Debian 4.0 (etch) for 68k, and a current effort to revive it, so you could likely get a fairly recent version of gcc running.

There is also the possibility to cross compile.

The contemporaneous C environments (no idea if any had supporting Objective C) were Think C (later Symantec C++) and Apple's Macintosh Programmers Workshop. In theory, you might get one of these to compile an objective C supporting version of gcc.

Title: Can I parse PHP locally without the use of a local host server?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Often, when I am developing in PHP, I want to see minor changes instantaneously.  This requires me to either FTP to a web server and then refresh, or use a localhost server, both of which(as I understand) are essentially the same thing.

What I would like to know is, is there an IDE or other way to parse PHP output in a dynamic fashion?  I guess what I am thinking of is the WYSIWYG pane in some editors able to display code real-time.  

I understand the client-server paradigm, but would rather not have to upload the same file 40 times when making changes/error handling/etc.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can always just save your files inside your localhost folder. Tools like xampp make running a php server effortless. Open the file in a browser, and whenever you make changes they will instantly be visible without having to copy the files around.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I've heard that ActiveState's Komodo is IDE for php behaving more-less the way you described (at least it has dynamic syntax check, so it has to parse the script locally).
Try Komodo Website.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
You should setup your IDE to edit the ftp files in place. I use Edit Plus although I am sure others will do the same thing. In this mode, you open the files in the ftp directory browser (identical to the local one) and when you save, it is automatically uploaded to the server. You can also set it up to save the file locally in a  backup folder since it sounds like you aren't using source control. You then set it up so when you CTRL+B, the remote file will open a browser inside the editor (Look under project settings for the root paths). 

And yes, while the localhost webserver can be similar, there will be some incompatibilities you will have to overcome, especially if you are running windows and your host is a unix variant. For example: money_format() for one doesn't exist on windows, but is very usefull under linux. Also the configurations will be different even if the OS's are the same.

Good Luck!
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
This probably doesn't come up very often because it's so easy to install a local web server.  What is your OS?  

Also if your remote web server is accessible by SSH you could learn a screen oriented text-editor (such as the VI editor) and edit the source files on the server.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I feel the same way, but get around it easily by using an editor/IDE with FTP support.  Configure your account, and then edit files locally, but the editor/IDE pushes them to the server when you save them.  Notepad++ and PSPad both do this on Windows, and I use Gedit (default Gnome text editor) when on Fedora.  A Google search for "FTP text editor" or "FTP IDE" might serve you well.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
You could use the PHP command line, but that displays its output in plain text. You could take that output, save it as an HTML file, and display it with a browser, but I'd think that's more work than just setting up a local web server.

Aptana's PHP plugin has a built-in PHP server, so that's probably close enough to what you want, although I've never used it so I can't directly say anything about it.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
I may be mistaken, but it seems like you want to see changes without having to restore/maximize browser and clicking 'refresh'. So in other words, you want to see results without the inconvenience of having to maximize browser, clicking refresh, the minimizing it to get back to the editor. 

As far as i know, there is no IDE that will show PHP code dynamically in real time.

What you may want to do is, if you can, bind it so when you save a document, it automatically loads up a browser and refreshes the page for you.
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
Any IDE should notify you of syntax errors (normally with the wavy red underline), which will cut down on a lot of FTP-ing just to find you missed a semicolon.

Even though you say you don't want to use localhost, I would suggest using something like WampServer. The best thing about the latest version is you can install different PHP, MySQL and Apache "modules" and switch between them to mimic any server configuration. For example, "Apache 1.3, PHP 4.2" or "Apache 2, PHP 5.3" etc.
    
    
Title: Bug in intellisense - how to report to Microsoft?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I found a bug in the method stub generation of Visual Studio intellisense.

class A { }
class B : A
{
    A a;
    void f() { a.NewMethod(); }
}


When I choose "Generate Method Stub" on a.NewMethod(), I should get a public method. Instead, intellisense confuses itself and creates a protected method for me.

The compiler correctly complains about the call to the generated protected void NewMethod() in A.

Is there any way to report this to Microsoft?
This post says it's a Mission Impossible to get through.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Go to the Microsoft Connect site. At least they are listening there. Of course, it might take a while until you receive an answer (or a fix).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Per Microsoft expected behavior is

"A protected member of a base class is accessible in a derived class only if the access takes place through the derived class type."

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bcd5672a(VS.71).aspx

In your case a.NewMethod() generates an error because A is not derived from B.  Which is exactly what you're talking about.

Therefore, the "Generate Method Stub" command is flawed.

That said, use Microsoft Connect for bug reporting.  Let me know what the bug # is and I'll up vote it there.

Answer 1: 

    
    
The reason this is happening is because PHPStorm doesn't know what that variable is meant to be (it has nothing to be with Laravel). As far as PHPStorm knows it's just a param for a method.

As @LazyOne suggested, you can type hint the variable e.g.

public function scopeIncomplete(Builder $query)


Then at the top of the class just add the following use statement

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;


Alternatively, if you're using a OS X (I'm not sure of the shortcuts for Windows or Linux) you can move the caret in the Builder reference and then hit alt enter to import the class.

Hope this helps!
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
PHPDoc blocks can come in handy for this.

You can add this PHP comment just before the statement return $query, inside the function

/** @var $query \Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder */


In this way PHPStorm will correctly recognize the method

In VS search and replace tool, you can use [\r\s\S] character class to match any text spanning across multiple lines.

To match as few characters as possible to get a valid match, you need to use *? or +? lazy quantifier.

So, you can use

I am using Delphi 2009.

On a huge project 300+ units, 5 third party components, many libraries, very often the IDE gets frozen for seconds, very often when "intellisense" (I don't remember how it is called) tries to give me suggestions.

Answer 2: 

    
    
(Code Insight) Intellisense tends to be a bit of a pain, since it will use information from the code to check what intelligence it can serve. You can reduce the amount of "intelligence" by referencing to less units from your code. If unit one does not need anything from unit Two, then don't 'use' unit Two in that unit. Cleaning up the 'uses' clause will speed things up a bit.
You might also want to turn off some or all options that Intellisense provides. The IDE becomes a little less helpful then (but CTRL+SPACE is still your friend) but it will speed things up a bit.
With a project over 300 units, you should possibly rethink the original design. Is it possible to split up the units in logical blocks? Is it possible to move some units in separate packages or DLL's? It's not uncommon for large projects to be this big, though. But I myself tend to put related units together in the same subfolder, with multiple subfolders in my project for all logical unit-blocks.
The design of the project itself will always complicate things, though. Newer hardware, more memory, a faster hard disk and more patience are very practical with these kinds of projects.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
If that's 5 large component libraries you're using, this tip might help.

If you monitor your system's file access using SysInternals or something similar you'll see that it very frequently reads every folder in your IDE library path. Reducing the number of folders in my library path made a noticeable, though not drastic, improvement to Code Insight for me.

Move all your third party component DCU files into a single directory, then add that directory to the library path, removing the existing third party DCU directories from the library path at the same time.

You may have to copy a few DFM, RES and INC files to this new common DCU folder, but you'll get compiler errors letting you know about those.

I'm a JAVA developer that is learning Python and Django and I'm looking for a good development environment.  I would like to be able to edit python code, css, html and javascript all in the same editor if possible.  I have been trying out both Komodo and pydev.  I like Komodo so far.  Being a JAVA developer I am very comfortable in Eclipse but it just doesn't feel like it might be the right environment to be doing Python development in.  I was wondering if anyone had good recommendations.  I also have heard about CODA, TextMate and SubEthaEdit.  I should mention that I'm doing my development work on Mac.  I know these things are really opinionated but didn't know if there was some kind of "industry" standard for Python/Django development on the Mac.  

I have done the normal searches on stackoverflow and looked through this post as well What IDE to use for Python?.  I just haven't found an answer that seemed to fit my situation......
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If your familiar with eclipse, by all means try Pydev first. I was the opposite, I was/am a Python developer who switched to Java. There was no real difference between using Eclipse for Java and Eclipse for Python (Pydev), you still get inline docs, debugging, code completion, the whole bit. You also get a lot of great stuff along with it like subversive, mylyn, aptana, etc. 
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
As you're familiar with Eclipse, Pydev is a good choice.

Komodo is the only IDE/Editor I know which supports Django Template Language syntax highlighting. But it's really so rudimentary that I think you can live without it.

A lot of Mac developers use TextMate because it has a lot of creature features. 

If you're working with big files and need speed, look at BBEdit - it's amazing how fast it can find/replace stuff.

If you want an editor that is close to Eclipse, but not a full-blown Java-based/oriented IDE, Komodo Edit (open source) or IDE (commercial) is pretty good, though I can usually get it to crash within an hour. I think it doesn't like me.

My primary editor is vim or gvim, depending on what hosting system I am on. It handles every language, runs on Mac, Linux and Windows, and is very customizable and, when you're used to it, can be very fast. I spend 99% of my editing time in gvim and it's the first or second thing I install on a machine, along with my customized setup and favorite fonts and plugins.

I'm on OSX and I've recently tried out http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ and it looks pretty good, but I can't quite get comfy with it -- but if you're familiar with Eclipse, then you might like it.

Personally, I find that I'm plenty productive with TextMate and a few of the Textmate Python/Django bundles

I think you should give Geany a try.  Its very easy to use and is definitely one of my most favorite IDE's I have ever used. 
    
    
Title: Eclipse question - panels don&#39;t get restored when double clicking
Description: 
    
    
                    
You know how, in Eclipse, when you double click on a file tab (which shows the class name), the editor gets expanded to the whole screen minimizing other panels? Well normally I just double click again on the tab to restore everything, but all of the sudden double clicking again doesnt do anything (the editor remains in full screen and all other panels minimized)!

I am not sure what I did to cause this.  Any ideas how to get it back to normal? Thanks.

Try this menu option:

Window-
Answer 2: 

    
    
You might try "Reset Perspective" in the "Window" menu.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Do you have icons at the end that allow you to minimize and restore? If you do click on restore. It should also be available as a contextual menu item on the editor tab itself.
    
    
Title: PC to Macbook Pro Transition - Getting (re)started?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm in my second computer science course right now. I've enjoyed programming so far, but really have just scraped my way by. I've not done much programming outside of required class work. For similar reasons, I never really invested in downloading/learning software to help me program (IDE's, editors, compilers, etc). 

I know it sounds tedious, but my current setup is: notepad++ for coding; Filezilla to transfer .cpp &amp; .h files to school's aludra/unix and compiling; unix tells me where my bugs are and I go back to notepad++ to debug; repeat until done. 

This isn't fun - and I know it could be easier. But I put it off knowing that I was soon going to switch to a Mac. And, tomorrow, I'm switching.

So...


How should I set up my Macbook for the best programming experience? 
What IDEs and editors and debuggers and so on should I download? 
How will Mac programming differ from PC?


I'm open to all ideas and comments, even the most basic.

(Background - I'm learning/programming in C++ right now. Next semester, my classes switch to Java. I'm also going to take a class in web development, with HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP. My new laptop will be a late 2009 Macbook Pro with Leopard, or maybe Snow Leopard. Free would be preferrable for all programs.)

Thank you all.

How exciting for you, I'm sure your new lappy will be able to make your life as a novice programmer much, much simpler. 

Here's what I would do. 


Download and install eclipse. It's free, and it's a very good IDE to have if you're going to program java. There are versions available for c/c++ and php as well, and there is a silly amount of great plugins for just about anything you'll ever need. Get it here.
Get the subversive plugin to your eclipse. It will make your life so easy when it comes to managing your code through svn. You can download the plugin through eclipse.  
Download Ruby. Ruby is (imho) a great language for beginners, and the irb environment is very handy for trying little things out. Get it here. 
Get emacs. Emacs is a great editor, and it's free. Use it for editing your system files, or for coding if you find it suits you. Get it here. (I can also recommend Textmate, it's a really good editor, but unfortunatly not free. If you want to spoil yourself a bit, though, I'd really recommend it.)
If you're doing modelling, you should definitly treat yourself to a licence of omnigraffle. It will definitly make your life easier, and it will let you draw models like nothing else. Get it here. 
I would advise you not to bother with macports. Generally I find it will install everything, everyone and their dog on your lappy evertyime you use it, and that gets tedious pretty quickly.  
If you're doing any php-stuff, get MAMP. MAMP puts you three clicks away from a running apache, mysql and php-setup without you so much as thinking. Very good piece of software, I think. Get it here.


For the rest of it, just download stuff when the need arises. Most of the things you'll need to install comes in handly little installer packages, and you won't need to know much in order to get them installed and working on your computer. 

All the best of luck to you!

You definitely need Developer Tools from Apple. They include:


XCode, a very good IDE and editor
InterfaceBuilder
gcc, g++ and clang to compile code, in various versions
gdb as debugger
Instruments for performance analysis


as well as a lot of other utilities to program in C, C++, Java, Objective-C and Objective-C++.

Python, Ruby and PHP interpreters and libraries come preinstalled with every Mac so don't bother installing it by hand. (the Apache web server is also included, so you only need MySQL to have a full MAMP stack)

The Developer Tools package comes with every MacOSX DVD but I recommend you to download the latest version directly from Apple (it requires a free Developer account).

Once you installed it put XCode in the Dock and that's it! No other stuff needed.

NB: This is the simplest and only supported way of getting compilers and debuggers for C-based languages, even if you won't use XCode as an editor.

Speaking of editors, I recommend you to stick to XCode for a while because it is simple enough, yet very powerful, and it's free.

If you don't like it try TextWrangler (free) or TextMate (paid).
Vim and Emacs are two other good editors, but I don't recommend you to try them right now because they use obscure and non-standard key combinations, so you will spend a lot of time learning how to use them instead of programming.

Anyway the best thing you can do is to learn one editor very well, the effort in learning it will surely pay off every day.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Eclipse is the best editor for java.  It's available on a mac for free, just as it is on windows.

There's a good text editor made by barebones software called text wrangler.  It's free, and is good about syntax coloring for basic editing.

The best of the best for web development on mac is a tie between text mate and coda.  If you're going to be doing a lot of web development, they're worth the investment.

To run a test environment in mysql/php, download MAMP (the mac counterpart to WAMP).  Google search it - it's free, and really easy.

Mac programming doesn't differ at all from windows programming if you're writing java, php, etc., because it all goes the same place.  Java just boils your code down differently depending on your machine, but it does the same stuff.  PHP will probably be held on some sort of linux distro, so it's the same on both.  C++ is the same given the appropriate compilers.

Enjoy your mac!
    
    
Title: Is there a way to prevent Visual Studio 2008 from opening a file in design view by default?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm writing an NUnit TextFixture for portions of a Windows Forms application.  Some of the classes in the file are derived from UI component classes, like so:

[TestFixture]
public class MainFormTest : PersistenceTestBase // Base class here is not a form
{
    class TestMainForm : MainForm // MainForm inherits from Form
    {
        public new String SomeMethod()
        {
            // Some MainForm private method overridden to expose it to my test fixture
        }
    }

    private TestMainForm mainForm;

    [TestFixtureSetUp]
    public void TestFixtureSetUp()
    {
        mainForm = new TestMainForm();
    }

    [Test]
    public void TestMainFormDoesXYZ()
    {
        // Perform unit testing...
    }
}


However, an annoyance I have encountered is that since the classes inherit from UI component classes, Windows opens up the designer window when I double-click my unit test file in the Solution Explorer.  Which, since it's not a "real" UI element (but a test class), it displays as a broken UI (depending on how I arrange the file, messages like "The designer could not be shown for this file because none of the classes within it can be designed" are shown).  Is there a way to supress this behavior, or will I always have to right-click this file and "View Code"?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Right click, select "Open With...", select the editor you want and click "Set as Default".

Do you really need your test classes to pretend they're something they're not though? That doesn't sound like a terribly good idea to me.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Add a [System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategory("")] attribute to the class to prevent Visual Studio opening the designer when you double-click the file in Solution Explorer to open it.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Another solution:

Right-click file and click Open With... menu.  A dialog box opens, select Microsoft Visual Basic Editor and click Set as Default.  Click Ok and that's it, the file will always open in the future using the code editor instead of its designer.
    
    
Title: Fullscreen editors?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Whilst fiddling recently with Ulysses 2.0 - "The definitive creative writing package", I was struck by how effective the fullscreen/console mode was at focusing my mind on actually getting words on the page.

Are there any code editors that include a similar function? Or even a hack that allows code highlighting in Ulysees?

Preferably, for me, OSX, but feel free to list alternatives for others.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Any console based editor (vim, emacs, nano, ...) can be used in full screen mode, as long as the terminal in which it is run supports it. And I'd wager that most or all do. Usually this functionality is bound to F11 or Alt+Enter.

MacVim has a fullscreen mode: :set fullscreen, :help fullscreen, and ⇧⌘F.

Visual Studio has a fullscreen mode via pressing Shift+Alt+Enter.

Notepad++ has fullscreen mode by pressing F11 (or f12 i can't decide).
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I use Think from Freeverse. It's a free utility that highlights your current app and simply darkens everything else, enabling you to focus on your document.

You can use it with your favorite editor. If you use Eclipse, you can double click the editor tab to maximize it, collapsing all other views. You can also customize the colors (if you prefer white text on dark background). It's not quite the same, but not bad.

This is going to end up a long list!

I use Textpad as my text editor when not using Visual Studio - http://www.textpad.com - and it has a fullscreen mode.

HI,

I want to write a small Delphi IDE Expert for D2007-D2009 (aka.

Title: VS2008, Add New Item, &ldquo;Web Content Form&rdquo; option is missing
Description: 
    
    
                    
Today I realized that I no longer have a ”Web Content Form” option (where you select a MasterPage) when I add new items to my ASP.NET web application. I know how to manually add a MasterPage to a web form, it’s just such a pain – and I really don’t understand why Web Content Forms suddenly are missing.

Visual Studio Team System 2008, SP1, VB.NET, ASP.NET 3.5

I recently installed and uninstalled VisualSVN. My best guess is that screwed up my poor VS somehow.

How do I get Web Content Forms back??
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Did some digging and I think the Templates live here:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\

and the template for the content page is this:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\ItemTemplates\CSharp\Web\1033\ContentPage.zip

I am unsure about how you would get a new copy of that file if it is missing for you without reinstalling VS

Try resetting all of your settings.

This will bring up the settings import wizard.  Choose reset all settings and select the Profile your are comfortable with (your post said vb.net so probably the VB profile).  See if that fixes the issue.

Title: Way to see if a method of an abstract class is not overridden by one of the extending classes
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a abstract class , let's say AbstractClass and multiple other classes (700+) extending that abstract class. AbstractClass has a method, let's say baseMethod() which is not an abstract method. Many classes(500+) override that method and have their own implementation. Now with eclipse I can easily see the ones that override that method by doing Ctrl+Shift+G, but is there a way other than manually, to see the classes that don't override that method baseMethod() ( the remaining 200 ) but is a class extending AbstractClass.
