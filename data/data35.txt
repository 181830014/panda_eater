I'm testing something and the output windows is being flooded with exceptions.
How can I filter an exception type that is shown in the output window.

Note:
Avoiding exceptions is not possible in this case.

I do not believe this is possible.  I think you can suppress all exceptions if a certain option is ticked but there is no way to filter the ones that are displayed.

Hiding an exception type is not possible as I know.
But to filter out all exception messages, right click output window and uncheck "Exception Messages".

Description: 
    
    
                    
I have just switched over to using PyCharm as my primary Python editor, and am curious to know how I can configure it so that every time I save a file, that the unit-test corresponding to the modified file will be run? (after poking around the documentation, I have not found a clear explanation of how to do this)

When you run a unittest you get a new unittest window. In this window there's a button where you can toggle auto-testing on and off, see below. You can set the auto-test delay as well (look for the gear-icon in the same window.

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Here is the way that I decided to accomplish my objective.

I use file watchers (PyCharm-&gt;Preferences-&gt;File Watchers) to monitor the python source files for modifications. Source files are located in a directory called src. For my purposes, each unit test is located in a directory that is parallel to the src directory called test_src, in which each file src/[file_name].py will have an associated test file called test_src/test_[file_name].py. Unit tests will by run by py.test. 

To accomplish this, I use the following setup in the File Watchers dialog:

File type: "Python Files"
Scope: "Only watch files in src directory"
Program: /usr/local/bin/py.test
Arguments: $ProjectFileDir$/test_src/test_$FileName$
Working directory: $ProjectFileDir$


I also unchecked "Immediate file synchronization" as I only want to run the unit tests when the file is saved.

Note that the "Scope" is used for specifying which files will be monitored.

Just found the solution. 

I tried to launch Android Studio from the Start menu, which provoked that issue. So I tried to launch from its main directory and it worked. The shortcut target path was wrong.

Shortcut target path Before: 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-studio\bin\studio64.exe


Real executable path: 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-studio\studio.exe


The studio.exe and studio64.exe inside bin folder doesn't work, but the one in android-studio seems to work perfectly. Just change the shortcut's target to that path and you're ready to launch it properly from the Start Menu.

Right now it does not. It only suggests, more or less, identifiers and modules

import numpy &lt;---  numpy is not suggested as I type it.

numpy.a &lt;--- And here, nothing that begins with 'a' is suggested.

Sublime's autocomplete is intended to match within the current file.

If you want to have code completion based on syntactic features of the language, you have many options, but I would suggest some combination of the following:


Install the CodeIntel package (package control instructions here)
Use snippets

Install Python snippets through package control (I like sublime-unittest).
Instructions for creating your own snippets.

Title: Embedded code development (especially for PIC with C18) in Visual Studio
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Visual Studio for writing desktop applications, and I find it very user friendly and easy to use.

If possible, I also want to write embedded code in Visual Studio. For example, is it possible to generate .hex files for PIC18Fxxx series with C18 or any other similar C-based language?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Unfortunately, there is no official support for PIC by Visual Studio. And, I didn't ever hear that someone has made this in an "unofficial" way. There have always been rumors and speculations about such a feature, but never get a chance to be realized. So, the answer is "no", there is no way of compiling .hex file with the standard Visual Studio IDE.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I do a lot of development with embedded systems, including PIC,  and for the most I use Visual Studio, mainly because I like VIsual Assist for C work.

What I do is multi target....  so  I compile the code for the PC and use unit testing tools to test the code  http://code.google.com/p/seatest/   

This means putting stubs in place for all the PIC related hardware

Then you can either trigger off build tools via the TOols menu, or you swap to a native IDE ( like MPLAB) for debugging on the device
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Visual Studio (specifically Visual C++) can be used as a code editor for any code for any target, but as complete IDE it falls short.

MPLAB has the ability to output a makefile for the project.  You can then use this in Visual Studio by creating a "Makefile Project", and entering the build command.  The makefile MPLAB generates is compatible with GNU make rather than MS nmake, you will have to install that too.  To make full use of Visual Studio's code navigation and intellisense features, you must add all the project headers and sources to your Visual Studio project - these do not affect the build, but they will be parsed for source browsing, auto-completion etc.  Any command-line or compiler pre-defined macros your project uses should also be added to the build settings, and the path to any compiler and additional library header folders should also be added to the project includes.

This works well and allows you to edit and build your code, but is probably only worth doing for large projects.  The compiler output may need some massaging to place it in the format that VS understands so that for example clicking on an error message takes you to the appropriate file/line.  I have used the GNU sed utility to do that in the past.  You still have to launch MPLAB  to load and debug your code; if open Visual Studio will pick up any changes you make in MPLAB automatically (just remember not to make unsaved changes in both environments!).

The problem with this approach is that the is no way to sync teh MPLAB project with the VS file set and settings - you have to do that manually.

Another problem is that for some reason, the makefile that MPLAB generates does not include the post/pre biuld steps in a project setup.  You can modify the makefile by hand or create a batch file that does pre/make/post steps and call that instead of plain make in your project.
    
    
Title: C++ IDE that supports Scott Meyer&#39;s advice: Prefer non-member non-friend functions over members
Description: 
    
    
                    
Scott Meyer's argument that non-member functions increase encapsulation and allow for more elegant design (designwise) seems very valid to me.
See here: Article

Yet I have problems with this. (And seemingly others too, especially Library developers, who usually completely ignore this)

Code usually looks better and more logical when I use member functions. This may be an acquired taste though and just takes some getting used to looking at algorithms first and then on the objects. (shudder)

So maybe I have only one problem:

With member functions, me AND my IDE know what the class can do.

For me this is huge! I use nothing that doesn't support member function code completion for programming. In well designed libraries it completely replaces documentation for me.
And even if I would look at the api doc, looking through the member list just feels absolutely natural, logical and I can be sure that, well, this is the end. If the method is not in there, I can safely assume it doesn't exist and I can write my non-member non-friend.

I put up with this in the STL, because, well, it makes sense to see algorithms apart from basic components and because of the you get used to it factor.

I haven't seen an IDE that can tell me what non-member functions work on a particular class. 

And this actually is my question:
Is there an IDE (or IDE feature) out there that helps with this code convention?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I've come across this thing in the past.

My idea then was rather clumsy, but got the job done: namespaces. 

What I did was

namespace myclass
{
    class MyClass
    {
        ...
    };

    MyClass operator+(const MyClass&amp; lhs, const MyClass&amp; rhs){...}
}

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Meyers is certainly correct that using non-members increases encapsulation, by minimising the number of functions that could potentially access the private state. However, encapsulation is just one of many (often conflicting) aspects of code quality.

He does make a valid point that the library writer won't necessarily write functions for every possible usage of the class (since there may be usages that they don't think of). This means that you may well have to add non-member "helper" functions yourself, just as they would do if they followed Meyers's advice. So there's no way of knowing that the set of member and friend functions is indeed the only set of functions that act on the class.

As a technoluddite, the "IDE" that I favour (a text editor and a shell) has the following "feature" that's pretty good for finding the functions acting on a class:

find . -name '*.h' -o -name '*.cpp' | xargs grep MyClass


I can't comment on "real" IDEs.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I don't believe it is possible for an IDE to tell you all non-member functions that you can use with your class. Using templates, it is simply too difficult to make a list of all such functions. IMO, the best you can hope for is for an IDE to be able to tell you before compilation whether a call you're trying to make is valid. And even that requires some serious compilation-like process inside the IDE.

I understand how you use member functions as a replacement for documentation in classic classes. But the design Scott Meyer suggests isn't about classes that provide complex functionalities, just basic ones. Complex functionalities come from elsewhere, the original class may or may not know about it, it does not really matter. It's all part of the idea. But you are right. In that case, there is a renewed need for well-thought documentation.

Title: Delphi Package Build / Install debugging
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm using Delphi 2007 Pro. I have a runtime package that includes a number of compound components I'm developing, which are based on TFrames.  There is also a related design package which installs these components to the tool palette.  These TFrame descendents use a number of third-party components, for various reasons, and also inherit from one another, as a class hierarchy.  So far (and with the help of some great advice here), this approach is working very well for what I want to accomplish.

Recently I ran into a problem, however, compiling/building the runtime package. Initially, it had to do with some conflict centering on nxEventLog.pas, the details of which unfortunately I failed to record, but was basically something along the lines of "the definition for this method does not agree with the previous definition for it," like what you get when your implementation declaration doesn't agree with your class declaration.  This file is a NexusDB file (the application uses a NexusDB embedded server).

I tried various things, but never was successful in getting the conflict to go away.  The closest I came was upon compiling, having the IDE request adding TRUCKLOAD of completely unrelated units to the contains/uses clause.  More on this later, but if I proceeded with that, it still wouldn't work.  The nxEventLog file had not changed from its original state.

Unable to ferret out why this error was showing up -- it was showing up in Nexus files, not my actual package or units, and I had changed nothing in the Nexus code -- I finally went ahead and just completely uninstalled Nexus, and manually searched to try to make sure I had deleted all related dcu and bpl files, and then reinstalled it.  (I'm running Nexus 2.07)

Upon firing up the IDE, I got the following errors:


bds.exe - Entry Point Not Found

As a rule, these errors come from having incompatible, or, more commonly, multiple versions of the same BPL and/or DCP files on the path. Do a full search of your system for all the BPLs and DCPs, and make sure there is only one copy of each.

Answer 2: 

    
    
If you have several related packages, the build and installation order is extremely important. If package A depends on B and some unit in B changes, it sometimes goes really wrong. You can reinstall Delphi, but its better to reinstall the packages in order.

First remove all packages. (With inslall packages and remove all you can.)

Then check the registry. Sometimes some information is left which can cause problems later on. 

In the HKCU\Software\ [Borland|Codegear]\[Version]\Disabled Packages, there is a list of packages that are disabled. Have a look at these. And remove anything you need.
In the HKCU\Software\ [Borland|Codegear]\[Version]\Known Packages, there is a list of all known packages. Have a look at these and remove all suspicious packages.


For older versions this infomation can be found in:
    In the HKLM\Software\Borland[Version]\Known Packages

Try to restart Delphi for sanity and rebuild and install anything needed in the correct order.
    
    
Title: Is there a .Net attribute to prevent property evaluation within the debugger?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've seen several classes in the framework with this behavior (a refresh symbol in the watch window, and a warning). Is this controlled by an Attribute? If so, how can I emulate this in my library?

EDIT: Thanks for the info! To clarify, I am developing a framework with properties that must access data from a single thread. Unfortunately, I am getting some odd behavior when I am in the debugger because of watch windows, etc. I have experience with the Debugger Browsable attribute; however, I would prefer to display the properties after the main thread has accessed / set them. I have seen, especially in IEnumerables that the debugger will not evaluate without user input.  ...Is there any way to flag these properties as requiring "Implicit Evaluation", Or can I not have my cake and eat it too? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is not controlled by attributes.  It's an inherent feature of the debugger. 

The underlying reason for this feature is to prevent unwanted function evaluations by the user.  Func Evals are a dangerous operation in the debugger and can cause significant slow downs or corrupt program state.  The debugger takes great care to make sure that it doesn't inadvertently do extra func evals that may degrade your debugging experience.

In the case where there is an item in the watch/locals/auto window that may cause a func eval and the debugger does not believe a func eval should happen, the value will grey out and a refresh button will appear in the value column.  Clicking on that button is telling the debugger, "no really I want to evaluate that expression".  

There are many reasons why this will happen in the debugger.  The following 2 though are the most likely.

Implicit Property Evaluation Is Disabled

Tools -&gt; Debugger -&gt; Options -&gt; Enable Implicit Property Evaluation

If this value is unchecked, you are telling the debugger please don't auto-evaluate properties.  Properties under the hood are just function calls.  They are generally safer than normal function calls but not always.  

But you can still force properties to evaluate by typing them directly into the watch window.  If you type 2 in a row, the first value will become "stale".  This is because typing a second expression in the watch window will cause all other expressions to get re-evaluated.  Why?  Because the act of evaluating any expression could have altered the results of the others.  

Because implicit func eval is turned off the first property will not auto-evaluate and you must force it. 

Func Eval and Step

If you add an expression to the watch window which does a function evaluation and then do a step operation, the value will be "staled" in the watch window.  

This is done for many reasons, one of the most impactful reasons though is stepping performance.  It's very common for a user to type many expressions in the watch window, and it's definitely not rare to have a function evaluation.  One at a time these aren't very slow.  But imagine you're trying to step quickly through some code and you had 10 func evals in the watch window.  That can quickly add up and significantly degrade your stepping experience.  So func evals are not automatically re-evaluated.  
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
While this doesn't generate the refresh icon you are referring to, a very useful attribute is System.Diagnostics.DebuggerBrowsableAttribute, which allows you to hide fields from ever showing up in Watch windows.  This is useful when fields and duplicated by property accessors and they don't need to show up twice, or if a property performs some substantial operation (like what you're suggesting) and you need to suppress it always so that the debugger doesn't evaluate it.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
This isn't exactly what you are looking for, but if you apply the [DebuggerStepThrough] attribute to the getter/setter of the property it will prevent the debugger from breaking on the property unless explicitly setting a breakpoint on the line.  This could be useful if you want to wait and set the breakpoint after you know it's safe to evaluate.  You could also use [DebuggerHidden] if you want to hide it from debugging all together.
    
    
Title: Do you draw a distinction between text editors and IDEs?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've seen several responses to questions asking for IDEs where text editors were suggested and vice-versa. That makes me think that people treat them as the same thing, where I draw clear distinctions.


How do you define "text editor" and "IDE"?
Do you see a difference between the two tools?


Note that I accepted an answer which I think best addressed the concepts of "text editor" and "IDE". However, it's just my personal opinion of what best addresses the question and I will continue to check in on this question from time to time to see if there's a better answer and I will accept that one.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I use both and I suggest you do too. Sometimes an IDE can make development faster - like code completion and refactoring support. Fast find of files and symbols, functions, classes in project not to mention project management features. Sometimes they'll manage the build for you. Maybe it has a built in debugger (a good built in debugger is worth gold). How about code snippets and file templates. Sometimes an IDE will help you build GUI interfaces and data stores. I've seen ones that help you build regexps and run SQL queries.

These (IMO) are all sugar. I also use a plain text editor (although I really appreciate code syntax coloring nowadays) and roll most of that other stuff myself. Some of the newer text editors are creeping into IDE territory (e.g. TextMate) since they are extensible enough to allow for most of the above paragraphs niceties.

In 90% of the cases I use what I am given or what the majority of the teams uses (I am a contractor). This reduces the build conflicts that can arise if you decide to go it on your own. By learning to use IDE's, text editors and everything in between you will stay flexible and able to cope with whatever is thrown at you.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I do, but it's more in the way you use them than a difference in the software itself. Some software is used as an IDE by some, but a mere text editor by others. Some software can only be a text editor, some is difficult to use as only a text editor, and some can be easily used as both.

I would say that such stalwarts as Vi(m) and Emacs are used by some as text editors and some as IDEs. Things like eclipse, visual studio, etc only really make sense as IDEs and things like notepad can hardly be anything but a text editor.

I would say if you stay in your text editor to do other things - compile, debug, etc - then you're using it more like an IDE. Quite where I'd draw the line, I'm not sure.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
The confusion arises from the fact that a text editor is a core component of every IDE. But, an IDE has much more than just a text editor; it also has interfaces to compilers, debuggers, profilers, reference material, and more.

Many text editors have plugins or other flexible extension mechanisms, often including the ability to "wrap" external tools like those I mentioned above. The key difference, IMHO, is the "I" in IDE - integrated. An IDE is (again, IMHO) something that's purposefully designed to support a specific set of tools, one of which is a text editor.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
The obvious difference is the "I" from the IDE.  IDE's are an integrated platform that allows not only editing, but debugging, file management for your project, and usually cool features like syntax highlighting and code completion. oh yeah, and integration of tools and compilers, as well as source control. 
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
To me, a text editor is light weight tool used to edit text based documents. There is no mark up or formatting of the text other than defining the "system" font for the editor. Useful tools can still be part of a text editor, like a folder tree, syntax highlighting, even cmd line execution of compilers. In the end though, all it does it allow you edit the text in a document. It will not display it to you in a different way. ie: it will not show you a grid when viewing an XML document

An IDE is much more robust and is generally specific to a language or framework. 

you know, before i started writing this answer, i had a clear line between a text editor and an IDE. But now, i'm thinking they are one in the same. I mean really and IDE like VS is just a glorified text editor. And a text editor like Textpad is an IDE with a much smaller budget for development of features.

I guess the real answer is, an IDE is backed by a large company or group expanding it's features in many different directions. But a text editor is built by a small group of people, with just enough features to get by.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
If you look at Kate, the text editor and Kdevelop, the IDE the main difference is that Kdevelop supports project management (CVS/Subversion) and build scripts, whereas Kate does not.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Personally where I think the 'line' is drawn between IDE's and Text Editors is knowledge of the end program, rather than just knowledge of it's source code.

As examples:


Can it compile your code into a binary? It's an IDE
Does it have an integrated debugger? It's an IDE


In order to have an integrated debugger it needs to know about either the binary compiled program, or in the case of scripting languages, the in-memory interpretation of the program as it runs.



Note: Things like intellisense don't rely on your code being compiled into anything, so I wouldn't say that intellisense implies IDE

Note 2: Many text editors like textmate have plugin systems which can be extended to build your project. This does not make them an IDE, as they are simply shelling out to a plugin, they don't have any knowledge about the building itself.

What is this icon?

Some codes are "hidden" because of this icon, when I click it, the IDE pops up the code snippet that's supposed to be there before, since codes disappeared, I can't reference it from other files either.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you are using a version control system (such as Git) in the project you are working on with the IDE, you will see these marks on the files (See sample images below).

File content


Grey triangles: deleted content
Blue rectangles: changed content
Green rectangles: added new content




These are seen when the changes are not yet committed. Once all the changes are committed the marks are gone.

If you click on those marks you will see the content that was there before the change took place.

Files

The same principle is applied for files (see below images)


Green: new file
Blue: modified file
Grey: deleted file


While working you see the files like this (deleted ones are omitted):



And, by the time you're committing changes you will see them like this (you see all files changed):

Title: Matplotlib does not update plot when used in an IDE (PyCharm)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am new to python and just installed pyCharm and tried to run a test example given to the following question: How to update a plot in matplotlib?


This example updates the plot to animate a moving sine signal. Instead of replotting, it updates the data of the plot object.
It works in command line but the figure does not show up when run in PyCharm. Adding plt.show(block=True) at the end of the script brings up the figure but this time it wont update.

Any ideas?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
The updating in the linked question is based on the assumption that the plot is embedded in a tkinter application, which is not the case here.

For an updating plot as a standalone window, you need to have turned interactive mode being on, i.e. plt.ion(). In PyCharm this should be on by default. 

To show the figure in interactive mode, you need to draw it, plt.draw(). In order to let it stay responsive you need to add a pause, plt.pause(0.02). If you want to keep it open after the loop has finished, you would need to turn interactive mode off and show the figure.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 6*np.pi, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.ion()

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
line1, = ax.plot(x, y, 'r-') 
plt.draw()

for phase in np.linspace(0, 10*np.pi, 500):
    line1.set_ydata(np.sin(x + phase))
    plt.draw()
    plt.pause(0.02)

plt.ioff()
plt.show()

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
As noted by ImportanceOfBeingErnest in a separate question, on some systems, it is vital to add these two lines to the beginning of the code from the OP's example:

import matplotlib
matplotlib.use("TkAgg")


This may render the calls to plt.ion and plt.ioff unnecessary; the code now works without them on my system.

I'm starting to use Xamarin Studio, and migrating from VS to it, but when I try to run a console application (the unique one loaded at the moment), fails and throws an exception in Console.Clear() (Supposing I can't do that in an integrated debugger), then i thought that one way to solve it was by compiling it and running it, like Visual Studio does, and Debug the application outside the IDE, but I can't figure out how. Could someone tell me how to solve this problem? Thanks.

EDIT: For any reason, it runs in the embedded window when selecting Release, but it can't read input, so it gets stuck.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You need to set the project option to have it run your console app in an external console:
Visual Studio For Mac:
Project Options / Run / Configurations / Default / Run on external console
Xamarin Studio:
Project Options / Run / General / Run on external console


    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can fix this by running your program in a separate console window.  It’s easy to do, although you need to follow the steps closely.  

The first step is to bring up the project’s options window.  You do this by finding your ‘Solution’ panel (normally on the left side of the Visual Studio window), and within that panel you much right-click on the project (this is pointed to by the “1” arrow in the below picture).  Once that context menu appears you need to click on “Options”, which may be very close to the bottom)



Once the Project Options window appears, you should click on Run  Configurations  Default (next to the ‘1’ arrow, below), and then check off Run On External Console (next to the ‘2’ arrow, below)

 

Once that’s done you’ll need to click the ‘Ok’ button.

Everything should work fine at this point, but it’s always good to double-check: try running a program that asks you to type something and verify that it’s working correctly.

The documentation has not changed between the two versions.


  Creating a Registry Script File
  
  
  Create a new text document (you can use any text editor) and copy the following text into it:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Embarcadero\BDS\17.0\ModernTheme]
"FontName"="Segoe UI"
"FontSize"=dword:0000000a
"MainToolBarColor"="clGradientActiveCaption"

  
  Note: See the table of customizable values for details about the specified values.
  Save the document with the .reg extension.
  Execute the registry script file that you created. A warning about changing the registry may appear. You must accept it in order to apply the changes.
  
  Note: You may need Administrator permissions to be able to execute registry script files. If the IDE is open when you set or change registry values, you must restart the IDE for the values to take effect.
  


The default values for the font appearance are as shown above, and it seems you are just reassigning them.
    
    
Title: Is it more difficult to parse the syntactic structure of C++ than other languages?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have observed that almost in all IDEs code completion for Java and C# is better than that for C++. For example, in Netbeans, Java auto-completion is far superior to C++ auto-completion, while in Visual Studio, C# auto-completion is way better that Visual C++.

There are tons of IDEs out there offering very good Java auto-completion, but the same is not true for C++, even though it is the older language.

Is it more difficult to parse C++? If so, why?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Parsing C++ is more difficult, because the grammar is very stateful.  Knowing whether A * b; is a pointer declaration or multiplication depends on whether the identifier A in the current scope refers to a type or variable.

But it's not just parsing.  Autocompletion requires semantic analysis, overload resolution, template expansion, selection of template specializations, evaluation of constexpr functions since they can appear in template argument lists...

Basically to determine the type of an arbitrary C++ expression and list the members of that type, you need all of a non-optimizing compiler except the machine code generation.

Most of the above steps don't apply to languages that don't have template specialization.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The C++ FQA has a wealth of information about this (although it is written in a style that could be described as "very informal").

Here is some of what it has to say about the factors involved:


  is AA BB(CC); an object definition or a function declaration? It turns out that the answer depends heavily on the code before the statement - the "context". This shows (on an intuitive level) that the C++ grammar is quite context-sensitive.
  
  ...
  
  So let's locate the definition of CC and move on, right?
  
  ...
  
  there's no way to tell in which files CC is defined, or which files must be parsed in order to "understand" its definition


And all of that's before we even begin to consider the turing-complete template system which can automatically generate new code at compile time.

Another advantage that Java and C# have over C++ in this area is reflection.  Once you've compiled a Java class, you can load it into a JVM (and you know what file it's in because Java specifies these things) and use the standard interface to inquire as to its methods and so forth.  C++ does not provide that capability.

I still haven't found a truly satisfactory answer to this question, and am now considering rolling my own.

You have to add designide to your requires clause. When you install this design package a new menu item Test should appear under Delphi's Help menu. Clicking it should display all loaded classes in the Messages window.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Unfortunately, the code implementing the RegisterClass mechanism is hidden in Classes implementation section.

If you need this for getting the list of components installed in the IDE, you can write a design package, install it into the IDE and use IOTAPackageServices in ToolsAPI unit. This will give you the list of installed packages and their components.

Note: You'll have to add designide.dcp to your 'requires' clause to be able to use Delphi's internal units like ToolsAPI.

A bit more work but a more generic way would be to enumerate all loaded modules. You can call GetPackageInfo (SysUtils) on a package module to enumerate contained unit names and required packages. However this will not give you a list of classes contained in the package.

You could enumerate the package's list of exported functions (e.g. with TJclPeImage in the JCL) and search for those named like this:


  @&lt;unit_name&gt;@&lt;class_name&gt;@


for example: '@System@TObject@'.

By calling GetProcAddress with the function name you get the TClass reference. From there you can walk the hierarchy using ClassParent. This way you can enumerate all classes in all packages loaded in a process running a Delphi executable compiled with runtime packages (Delphi IDE, too).
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Have you tried Delphi's own class browser? 

The browser gets loaded with shortcut CTRL-SHIFT-B. I believe you can access its options by right clicking in the browser. Here you have the option to show only the classes in your project or all known classes.  

I haven't checked but I expect every descendant from TComponent, including installed components to be visible below the TComponent node. Use CTRL-F to search for a particular class.



Edit: according to this Delphi Wiki page, CTRL+SHIFT+B is only available in Delphi5. I don't have Delphi 2007 to check for this but if you can not find a class browser in your version, I'd suspect there isn't any.
    
    
Title: Scala IDE for data science applications (like RStudio / Spyder / Rodeo)
Description: 
    
    
                    
With the rise of Spark, Scala has gained a tremendous momentum as programming language of choice for data science applications.

To increase the efficiency when working on data science applications, specialized IDEs have been released for 


R (e.g. RStudio) and 
Python (e.g. Spyder or Rodeo, see Is there something like RStudio for Python?). 


Is there something similar for Scala?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any dedicated Data Science IDEs for Scala at this time. I think these would be your best options:

IntelliJ Worksheets:


This is basically a text editor with an output window which gets updated as often as you want. Eclipse has something similar, I just prefer IntelliJ. 

Pros:


Backed by IntelliJ's fantastic code completion, error checking, and sbt/maven integration.
You can prototype within the same project setup as your actual development system (if you have one).


Cons:


I am not aware of any caching/selective evaluation so the entire worksheet is evaluated each time you want an answer, something you may not want if you have some operations which take a long time to complete.
No workspace variables window or plot integration.


Jupyter Notebooks


The Jupyter Notebook is a generalization of the iPython notebook which now supports dozens of interpreted languages (new kernels are being added all of the time).

Pros:


Scala and Spark Scala Kernels are fairly easy to install, both have the ability to add maven/sbt dependencies and JARs.
The cells in the notebook can be run individually (allowing you to train a model once and use it many times, for example).
The cells support markdown (with LaTeX!) which can be rendered on its own (a github example), allowing you to use your notebooks as a report/demonstration.
Notebooks are backed by a Notebook Server so you could easily use a more powerful computer as your notebook server and then interact with the notebook from another location.
Some kernels have autocompletion.
Looks like there is some plot integration (example) but it is not totally polished.


Cons:


Not all kernels are perfect, some have bugs or limited functionality.
No workspace variables window.
You really need to be careful about the ordering of your cells, failure to do so can cause a lot of confusion.




For most of the data-sciency stuff I do I use Jupyter but it is far from perfect. In order for Scala to really take over as a Data Science language it really needs more data science libraries (scikit-learn is sooo far ahead here) and it needs a solid plotting library (there are a few options but none I have seen both use idiomatic Scala and are able to run without a server). I think as soon as it has those two elements it will become more popular and hopefully someone will make a nice RStudio-esque IDE.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Your best shot (nothing like rstudio but this would be your best shot for scala) is apache zeppelin


    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I would recommend you to look at Scala IDE for Eclipse. But i think, it really depends on your personal choice in which you are comfortable writing the code. For testing code by code, i would still use jupyter notebook
    
    
Title: Eclipse + GWT -&gt; Out of memory in development mode
Description: 
    
    
                    
If I run my GWT application in eclipse in development mode and click around in the browser for some time, I always get an "out of memory" error in eclipse. My computer has 16 GB Ram, and there is never used more than 8GB.

I tried several config parameters. The VM-arguments in my Run configuration contain these parameters: "-Xms8192m -Xmx8192m"

Even in the eclipse.ini I tested several config parameters and now it looks like this:

--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
8192M
-showsplash
org.eclipse.platform
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
8192m
--launcher.defaultAction
openFile
--launcher.appendVmargs
-vmargs
-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.6
-Xms8192m
-Xmx8192m


But I still get the error. Is there any way to prevent this?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If the browser application is throwing the OutOfMemoryError, then you don't need to change the Eclipse settings (eclipse.ini), that's only for Eclipse itself (more memory, usually faster workbench).

To increase an app's memory (any Java app launched from Eclipse), go to the Run/Debug configurations... in the Run menu and set the VM arguments on the Arguments tab of the app's run config:

-Xms128M -Xmx1024M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
put this in vm arguments in your run configurations:
-Xmx2048M -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    

  If I run my GWT application in eclipse in development mode and click around in the browser for some time, I always get an "out of memory" error in eclipse. 


Not exactly sure what the problem is but I do see some issues with your current arguments.


You have 2 launcher args that are the same.  You don't need the 2nd entry of:

--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
8192M

I really doubt that you want 8g of PermSize. Something like 512m is probably much better. You can use jconsole to see how much memory is in the perm space bucket.  In the below image taken from jconsole's memory tab, the bar highlighted at the bottom right shows the "Perm Gen" space.  Right now it is using 26,906kb (or around 27mb).  That's where code goes and it often has to be increased if you have many JSP pages which get compiled as well.



If you run your application with the following params you should be able to connect with jconsole to see how it's doing:

-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false


I suspect that you are going to see that you are using far, far less in the "Perm Gen" space.  The -Xmx8192m (or -Xmx8g) is all you need typically.  It will give 8gb of memory to the heap in general which is typically short lived objects.  It also scales the various different memory partitions accordingly.


For more information about various heap spaces see the Java hotspot documentation.
    
    
Title: Not able to create Android application project in Eclipse. Error Message - Enter an application name (shown in launcher)
Description: 
    
    
                    
I want to create a fresh Android application project in Eclipse. But when I try to create a project it every time gives me the message on the first screen of creation.

Enter an application name (shown in launcher)



When I remove the theme also



I have already entered a name for that application.

I am using:


Android api level 10
Eclipse Version: Indigo Service Release 2,Build id: 20120216-1857
Operating System : Linux Fedora 17


There are projects which I am developing on the same machine.

I have several times restarted eclipse and my developing machine. What is happening?

This my sdk image for api level 17



Update from the solutions I got that my ADT plugin was not updated for Android sdk tools version 22. So now I have updated it but I have another error. See:


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This issue has been often occurred by Many People. you can see HERE

Solution given by them is to 


  Update ADT plugin and then SDK tools and after when you will try  to
   create a new project, the error will not occur


Hope this will Help.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I think you don`t have any API installed to compile. First install an API version in SDK Manager and later try again to create a new project.

UPDATE:

If you update SDK Android, probably you must update ADT.

For the last error update eclipse.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
In Eclipse, go to Window -&gt; Android SDK Manager. Select one or more SDK Platforms to install.
You have to install the sdk platforms before creating the Android application project.
See if this helps.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Go to Android SDK Manager

tools -&gt; android sdk buid tools (Select last rev. and install the pack.)


thats worked for me.
    
    
Title: What is the fastest way to create a cross-platform IDE for a new programming language?
Description: 
    
    
                    
The title already says most of what I'm after, but let me state some of the requirements explicitly:


The language is not widely used, so writing a new language tokenizer etc is assumed to probably be required.
Cross-platform, means at least Linux, Mac OS and Windows
Minimal features: Syntax highlighting and Code-completion (aka "IntelliSense")
Preferrable features: Interactive debugging
Assumption: The developer is not an expert in any one programming language (although mediocre in a few, and eager to learn new techniques), so the focus on an environment / tools that quickly gets a developer up to speed, and is productive enough to reach the goal as fast as possible.

    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Xtext would be the perfect fit for these requirements. All you need to do is to define your grammar and you have your parser, linker, editor, etc. Of course all of this can be customized to your needs.

If your language compiles down to Java, you also get expressions and debugging out of the box.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Lazarus + SynEdit + SynCompletion (cross platform + syntax highlighting + autocompletion), interactive debugging is way to difficult I guess.
    
    
Title: How do I detect if the specific Delphi IDE is running?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm working on a component installer (only for Delphi XE2) and I would like to detect if the Delphi XE2 IDE is running. How would you detect it?

P.S. I know about the TAppBuilder window class name, but I need to detect also the IDE version.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
These are the steps to determine if the Delphi XE2 is running 

1) First Read the location of the the bds.exe file from the App entry in the \Software\Embarcadero\BDS\9.0  registry key which can be located in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Root key.

2) Then using the CreateToolhelp32Snapshot function  you can  check if exist a exe with the same name running. 

3) Finally using the PID of the last processed entry you can resolve the full file path of the Exe (using the GetModuleFileNameEx function) and then compare the names again.

Title: A python IDE with Code Completion including parameter-object-type inference
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have tested a variety of Python IDEs for their code completion capabilities. Does one exist that can do code completion in the following case:

def foo(x):
    print x.read()  // remove this line, and type in "print x."

def main():
    n = open("c:\\python27\\test.py");
    foo(n)


The IDE has to figure out that foo is invoked somewhere in the current module with a parameter which was return value from a call to open() which it would have to assume is a call to file.open, and thus, returns a file object.  Thus, x. followed by Ctrl+Space would invoke code completion and show that x, as a file object, can support any file object method, including read().

I have found that PyScripter, for example, can do this:

    n = open("c:\\python27\\test.py");
    n. // hit &lt;ctrl+space&gt; after n.


The above code completion scenario works because PyScripter does some special code completion logic to determine that n is a file object, but there doesn't appear to be a way to infer object types or available methods, from static analysis, that will deduce the types of parameters.

Secondly, if nothing like this is available in Python 2.x, in Python 3.x, now that there are static type hints, does any IDE support them?

   def foo(x:'file'):
        print x.read()  // remove this line, and type in "print x." and hit ctrl+space

The only one I think can do (almost) that is PyCharm 

But you must give it some hints:





If you're on Python 3, the IDE will check function annotations like that:

It's not a free IDE but, IMHO has the best code completion available.

In theory, anything is possible.

In practice, I'm not sure that collaborative programming ... where lots of people are hacking on the same files in real time ... is going to be productive.  

Programs are qualitatively different to text / markup documents.  When you two people are simultaneously editing a program, semantically conflicting edits can break the "work" in a far more fundamental way than conflicting edits on a document.  I don't see this being an effective way to write programs.

I mainly use jEdit for Perl programming. 


The PerlSideKick plugin, allows you to navigate huge Perl modules (mainly just a plugin for the SideKick plugin). 
But there's not much to give you that easy Shift+click navigation you get from Eclipse. jEdit is 100% programmable through Beanshell macros (and JavaScript and Python and JRuby...). So, you can do some of this yourself. So there would be work involved.

For example, it been close enough for me to create "Selection macros" that will allow certain actions on the package or name either highlighted or at the caret. For example, open up the module indicated by the package name. 
The Navigator plugin will at least remember where you were last across files.
You might be able to do cross-module navigation through one of the tags plugins 


So this won't get you all the way you'd want to go, but it will get you some of the way, and for $0. 


It has the most configurable source highlighting this side of writing Emacs-LISP.
It does FTP and remote editing cleaner than most editors I've used. 
You can build up a library of Beanshell (shorthand Java) scripts that really help you get what you want done. 


Just remember that this recommendation comes with caveats. I have found EPIC quite sub-standard for my use. 
    
    
Title: Ruby on Rails use an IDE or stick with a good text editor
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am an experienced programmer and an enthusiastic new adopter of Ruby on Rails.  I'm mostly using a mac, unix, and textMate, to get the job done.  I've written some small apps on my own and am excited by the potential to write something more complex.

Should I commit time and resources to using (learning) an IDE for RoR?  Please respond if you are someone who has used a configuration similar to mine and an IDE for RoR.

This is not a question about which IDE is the best, or which platform is preferred for RoR.

I'm more concerned with the cost/benefit of committing to any IDE that is built over a broad set of changing and evolving tools.

In addition, the detailed understanding of file structure and directory layout that just using a text editor fosters seems like a good skill to continue to grow as I broaden my use of the features in rails.

And... HTML, CSS, and ruby, are all well assessed with text editors that have the most basic formatting features.

On the plus side, I find IDEs that offer hand holding (templates, autocomplete text, etc.) for generating unit testing (TDD) with RSpec are appealing as this is an area in which I have limited experience.

My big worry is that I'll commit to an IDE, write an application, and then get stuck when ruby, rails, or some other key component I am using updates in a way that the IDE folks never anticipated.  Using an IDE and periodically editing files or resources outside the particular IDE paradigm has burned me in the past.  Previous gotchas have also included language features that an IDE did not account for well, thereby limiting development flexibility.

Most rubyists use a plain editor. What you need is the ability to jump to specific files easily, syntax highlighting, and really thats about it. Ruby is fairly succinct, and our class hierarchies are fairly flat, so you dont usually end up needing a lot of what an IDE offers.

Personally, I use vim with a bunch of plugins, and find myself more productive then I ever was in my Visual Studio years. I picked up a license for RubyMine awhile back during a sale, it is a fantastic IDE, and would probably use it if I couldnt use an editor for some reason.

If you want a recommendation, I would say vim with three plugins - Rails.vim (make vim more aware of rails and its structure), Command-T (great for jumping around between files quickly), and NERDTree - a graphical tree based file browser. 

Like I said early, those capabilities are the most important thing for whatever you choose, so even if you dont go vim, make sure the editor you choose can do those things. CommandT especially, being able to fuzzy-find files at a keystroke will save you endless hours of clicking through gui file browsers over the course of your career.

If you are using Textmate, no need to change. That has everything you need. Just make sure to get the proper ruby/rails bundles and you should be good to go.

Answer 3: 

    
    
Ruby is not a statically typed language so much of the benefit you gain from an IDE auto-completion isn't available. A few Ruby IDEs try to be intelligent about this (RubyMine, NetBeans, etc)  and do a fair job but their unbearably slow.

You'll find that once you've committed to the shortcuts that TextMate provides, you won't miss your IDE.

As far as hand-holding goes, check out Railscasts and Rails Guides. I think you'll find that spending time on those two sites will fill in 80-90% of the "conventions" you'll need to get started.

I've been using NetBeans for C++ development on Linux for the last month or two and love it.  I'm working on an large code base 1+million lines of code.  As long as your project references appropriately, I've found that NetBeans will provide "intellisense" information with hardly any issues.  Now, it's not perfect, and is definitely not as good as Java, but I've not found a better alternative.  NetBeans debugger, which is a front-end to gdb, works well also.  Much easier, and in my experience more stable than DDD.  I've not tried Mono projects using NetBeans so I can't speak to that.

This is of course completely unacceptable for a modern UI application. It also feels kind of sluggish.

Title: Show line number in script editor

Is there any way in a standard R environment how to show cursor position (at least line number) in script editor in R? I've tried to look at options but no success. 

I am using R for Windows (XP, 7, ..).

According to Ben Bolkers' comments, it is not possible in current version of R (until someone hacks it).

Try R studio. It is perfect IDE for R development, I think that it has feature like this.

I think there comes a point where - if you're at all serious - you need to consider something more powerful than a text editor. Once you've come to that conclusion, the second thing you need to consider is whether you will be using the platform only for R or for other languages as well.

If you are coding only in R I think RStudio makes a lot of sense and you should certainly try it. For me it didn't quite 'fit' my way of working and in addition to R I use Perl and a bit of Python so I wanted something that could handle multiple languages. I eventually decided on and now use Emacs with ESS. This is not as obviously attractive and modern as RStudio but it is powerful, flexible and runs on just about any machine.

Vincent Goulet's package of Emacs and ESS for Windows is a good way to get started. Originally I liked KomodoIDE but R is not explicitly supported by ActiveState and I couldn't get it to work with R using third-party utilities so in the end I went with ESS. ESS has been a good choice for me.
    
    
Title: How to do these 2 things in Sublime Text 2?

I recently switched editors from Netbeans IDE to Sublime Text 2. In Netbeans when coding PHP if I had a syntax error it would have an error icon at the start of that line.

Sublime Text 2 doesn't seem to do this out of the box. What plugin do I have to install to get this feature?

In Netbeans you can set up code templates. You will basically write for example something like this:

&lt;script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


and call the template jquery. Then everytime you need to use jquery on a page you just tyoe jquery and hit tab and the script tag will be inserted in that spot.

How to do this type of code template/shortcut in Sublime?

Php Syntax Check

The SublimeLinter plugin supports automatic php syntax checking:

Template

For javascript sources you can use the cdnjs plugin:

More generally, you can create your own templates. Here's one to accomplish what you'd like. Save this in the User's folder of your packages directory (go to Preferences -/pprecode/code/pre/div
Title: Can the JEDI Code Library, Delphi IDE menu item (JCL Options&hellip;), be moved?

Is there a way to move the Delphi IDE menu item Tools-/ppimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hsjYA.png" alt="enter image description here"/p/div
Answer 1: 

    
    
In JclOtaActions.pas, in TJclOTAActionExpert.RegisterCommands it registers the menu item:

ToolsMenuItem.Insert(0, FConfigurationMenuItem);


I think if you change it to:

ToolsMenuItem.Add(FConfigurationMenuItem);


Then it will at the bottom.

Hope this points you in the right direction...

When debugging programs in Xcode 3, I often used the Memory Browser in a seperate window to view the contents of a buffer change while I step through the lines of code.

As I now started using Xcode 4, I wonder how to open a Memory Browser. I can't find anything like that in the UI. Can anybody provide help?

You may make VS GUI faster by disabling animation.
Uncheck "Animate environment tools" checkbox in tools - options - environment - general.
This may help...

After a windows crash my IntelliSense context menu (when clicked over a member/class/declaration) became very slow (~10s to open it). Solution was to close my VS2012, and delete solution cache files (solutionname.suo). 

Keep in mind that .suo files are hidden.

After reloading the solution all came back to normal!

The problem is possibly a timeout trying to connect to a Visual Studio Team Foundation Server.  To disable this in VS 2012:
