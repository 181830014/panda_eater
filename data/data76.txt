Title: How do I make IntelliJ IDEA 8.1.x ignore an item in .gitignore
Description: 
    
    
                    
I enjoy Git support in Intellij IDEA 8.1.3.  I've been doing some Grails Development on Linux with it.

IDEA seems to be ignoring other files from .gitignore like /tests/reports, etc. but is not ignoring stacktrace.log.  In other words changes to stacktrace.log show up in the 'changes' window 

The contents of my .gitignore file is:

*.iws
.DS_Store
/out/**

# web application files that are overwritten by "grails upgrade"
#  cf. GRAILS_HOME/scripts/Upgrade.groovy, target( upgrade )
/web-app/WEB-INF

# IDE support files that are overwritten by "grails upgrade"
#  cf. GRAILS_HOME/scripts/CreateApp.groovy, target( createIDESupportFiles )
# to be specific, you could replace "/*" below with your project name,
#  e.g. "foobar.launch" (no slash)
.classpath
.project
.settings
/*.launch
/*.tmproj

# logs
stacktrace.log
/test/reports

# project release file
*.war

/classes


Am I missing something obvious?
How do I make IDEA 8.1.3 ignore all items from .gitignore?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I added the .gitignore while stacktrace.log was still in the repository.
When I updated the .gitignore, I expected IDEA to ignore stacktrace.log.  

On the command-line when I ran git status I wouldn't see anything for stacktrace.log, but it was showing up as changed in the IDEA Changes window/tab.  After I deleted the stacktrace.log and refreshed in IDEA, it no longer showed in the changes window/tab.

Not that big of a deal really.

Is there any way to write Shoes application using IDE (NetBeans for example)?
I hadn't found this solution and I don't like running Shoes app, selecting files, run. 

I'm sure code for packing Shoes and IDE code will be different (I hope in require directives only), but I'm intresting in possibility.

Title: Visual Studio Debug Visualizer for all types
Description: 
    
    
                    
When developing a Visual Studio (2005) Debug Visualizer, you have to specify the target type you want to visualize (i.e. a DataSet Visualizer would specify its target at TypeOf(DataSet)). However, what if you want your Visualizer to be able to visualize any object type? Specifying the target to TypeOf(Object) doesn't seem to work.

Edit: this is for purely managed code.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can't, which is a shame.  The target type must be typeof(T) for some T other than "object".
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
You can't just visualize every object. There are certain requirements regarding serialization (for example). I never created a complex visualizer myself (just one for a custom mailobject), but that was the premise in all articles went to that direction.

Edit:

Mole 2010 is a great Visualizer that display generically many things.
    
    
Title: Visual Studio IDE layout tips
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've never found an "ideal" layout for coding in Visual Studio. I have a three-monitor setup, but it seems that the solution explorer/properties/output/errors/whatever panes are always getting in the way or hogging screen space. It's a bit open-ended, sure, but do you have an "ideal" layout with the myriad of floating/dockable/anchored setups for specific windows? For instance, I like to split vertical code panes between two screens, and typically the solution explorer is anchored to the right of the right-most code pane, but that chews up screen real estate that I'd rather have for the code. I was thinking of floating those sorts of things off to another screen.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Apparently VS 2010 will do a LOT more for multi monitor setups. ScottGu went over this at DevConnections 2008, and a few more times, usually wherever he goes.

I got the impression that the MDI or tabbed codefiles might be able to be detached from the IDE, and float/draggable onto another monitor.

As it stands today in VS 2008, Solution Explorer, Immediate Window, etc are detachable and be able to float onto another monitor, separate from the main IDE.
    
    
Title: Error &ldquo;Cannot change Visible in OnShow or OnHide&rdquo; in Delphi IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a very strange problem with the Delphi 2006 IDE.

If the IDE is minimized, and the PC is locked. I return to the pc, unlock it and maximize the IDE, I sometimes get the error "Cannot change Visible in OnShow or OnHide". 

If this happens, I have to kill the IDE with the taskmanager.

Is there anybody out there who has the same problem? And if possible a solution?

I suspect that some third party components are involved, but my coworkers never experience this error.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes I have noticed the same problem when using Terminal Servers. I use GExperts. If you can reproduce the problem you should report it on http://qc.codegear.com/
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Is this connected to a specific form / forms that you have open at the moment?

If not, then it's probably not a 3rd party component that causes problems, but an expert you have added to the Delphi. Try disabling all experts. If that solves the problem, add them back one by one.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Other way with no need to kill IDE in Taskmanager is to display Taskbar settings and turn off "show above other windows". Use this setting, click OK on IDE err. msg and then set it back. With some practice it could be usefull by time...

Btw: colleague's IDE layout setting is "classic undocked" and he never had this problem.

But something like bugfix is still missing :/

Description: 
    
    
                    
Running VS2003/05 under Vista makes the former screw up the display at least 50% of the time - you start debugging, VS kicks in and you see the windows/docking panes screwed up, not refreshing, etc...

I've recently started working with Aptana and Eclipse Monkey. What I want to do now is to create a script that saves a file then uploads it to a FTP.

Problem is that Eclipse Monkey is VERY poorly documented and Google returned only unrelated results.

I've made it upload the file, but I need the script to save the file before uploading.

sync.uploadCurrentEditor(); 


Do you know any resource for Eclipse Monkey with methods,etc ?

Check this out, it has the solution for your problem:

http://forums.aptana.com/viewtopic.php?t=5216

Edit; to be more specific;
You need to add the following line into the meta-data piece at the top, so the script knows the reference 'editors':

* DOM: http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dash/update/org.eclipse.eclipsemonkey.lang.javascript


After you've done that, you need to add the following line right before the sync. stuff;

editors.activeEditor.save();


That's it :)
    
    
Title: Using multiple web projects with different languages in Visual Studio
Description: 
    
    
                    
I need to combine a VB web project and a C# web project and have them run alongside each other in the same web root.  For instance, I need to be able to navigate to localhost:1234/vbProjPage.aspx and then redirect to localhost:1234/cSharpProjPage.aspx.  Is this possible from within Visual Studio 2008?

I know you have the ability to create a web site and throw everything into the root, but it would be best in this scenario to keep each project separate from each other.

UPDATE: To answer Wes' question, it is possible but not desirable to change paths like that (/vb/vbPage.aspx &amp; /cs/csPage.aspx)

UPDATE: Travis suggested using sub-web projects. This link explains how to do it  but the solution involves putting a project inside of a project, that is exactly what I am trying to avoid. I need the projects physically separated.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can do this using sub-web projects. This has been available in Visual Studio since 2005 and works with the Web Application Project style of web site. ScottGu has a great blog entry describing the process. You may face some interesting challenges getting pages to commingle in the same folder, but the sub-web project structure should still lend you some ideas.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I don't think you'll be able to have two seperate projects but intermixing them within one project isn't a problem. You could always organize the files into folder to keep things seperate if you felt the need.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Just out of curiosity, would changing your url paths be out of the question?  Instead of 1234/vbpage and 1234/cspage  how about something like 1234/vb/page and 1234/cs/page ?  I know you said same web root, but I'm just curious :)
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
you could use URL re-writting with a filter to look for "cs" or "vb" at the begining of each file and direct it to the appropriate directory.
    
    
Title: Using array parameters in the Eclipse HibernateTools plugin
Description: 
    
    
                    
How can I bind an array parameter in the HQL editor of the HibernateTools plugin?
The query parameter type list does not include arrays or collections.

For example:
     Select * from Foo f where f.a in (:listOfValues).
How can I bind an array to that listOfValues?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You probably cannot. Hibernate replaces the objects it gets out of the database with it's own objects (kind of proxies). I would strongly assume Hibernate cannot do that with an array. So if you want to bind the array-data put it into a List on access by Hibernate.

As an example one could do:

select * from Foo f where f.a in f.list

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I am sure you have already got the answer for this but for anyone else viewing this.  it appears that the HQL editor for hibernate tools does not support querying collections.  you whould have to not use the parameter and hard code it while testing in the Hibernate Tools HQL editor 

Select * from Foo f where f.a in (123,1234)


The change the query back to what boutta posted when you put it back in your code.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
This is how you pass a list to a HQL query.  I am not familiar with HQL editor... we are from the Nhibernate world.

select * from Foo f where f.a in (:foolist)

query.SetParameterList("foolist", list)

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    

In the hibernate perspective, you could see on the left side you can see left panel to enter query parameter, when you enter the :variable in the field and run the query you will get the result

Title: How Private is the Code your write using Visual Studio Code?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Since my previous attempt, to ask this question was closed for not being "focused" enough. Please focus your attention on only this:

How private is the code you write in Visual Studio code? Specifically, does any outside resource see the code you've written in Visual Studio code?

For example, Visual Studio has a lot of features that aid you in writing code. Are all those features locally self-sufficient, or does Visual Studio Code upload your code to cloud resources in order to facilitate some of those features?

If Visual Studio Code uploads your code to do processing, I'd consider that a violation of my privacy. I do not use Visual Studio code yet and this is a legitimate concern of mine before starting to use it.

Title: How to remove unused blocks of code from a source code file? [duplicate]
Description: 
    
    
                    
Original Question

What I'd like is not a standard C pre-processor, but a variation on it which would accept from somewhere - probably the command line via -DNAME1 and -UNAME2 options - a specification of which macros are defined, and would then eliminate dead code.

It may be easier to understand what I'm after with some examples:

#ifdef NAME1
#define ALBUQUERQUE "ambidextrous"
#else
#define PHANTASMAGORIA "ghostly"
#endif


If the command were run with '-DNAME1', the output would be:

#define ALBUQUERQUE "ambidextrous"


If the command were run with '-UNAME1', the output would be:

#define PHANTASMAGORIA "ghostly"


If the command were run with neither option, the output would be the same as the input.

This is a simple case - I'd be hoping that the code could handle more complex cases too.

To illustrate with a real-world but still simple example:

#ifdef USE_VOID
#ifdef PLATFORM1
#define VOID void
#else
#undef VOID
typedef void    VOID;
#endif /* PLATFORM1 */
typedef void *  VOIDPTR;
#else
typedef mint     VOID;
typedef char *  VOIDPTR;
#endif /* USE_VOID */


I'd like to run the command with -DUSE_VOID -UPLATFORM1 and get the output:

#undef VOID
typedef void    VOID;
typedef void *  VOIDPTR;


Another example:

#ifndef DOUBLEPAD
#if (defined NT) || (defined OLDUNIX)
#define DOUBLEPAD 8
#else
#define DOUBLEPAD 0
#endif /* NT */
#endif /* !DOUBLEPAD */


Ideally, I'd like to run with -UOLDUNIX and get the output:

#ifndef DOUBLEPAD
#if (defined NT)
#define DOUBLEPAD 8
#else
#define DOUBLEPAD 0
#endif /* NT */
#endif /* !DOUBLEPAD */


This may be pushing my luck!

Motivation: large, ancient code base with lots of conditional code.  Many of the conditions no longer apply - the OLDUNIX platform, for example, is no longer made and no longer supported, so there is no need to have references to it in the code.  Other conditions are always true.  For example, features are added with conditional compilation so that a single version of the code can be used for both older versions of the software where the feature is not available and newer versions where it is available (more or less).  Eventually, the old versions without the feature are no longer supported - everything uses the feature - so the condition on whether the feature is present or not should be removed, and the 'when feature is absent' code should be removed too.  I'd like to have a tool to do the job automatically because it will be faster and more reliable than doing it manually (which is rather critical when the code base includes 21,500 source files).

(A really clever version of the tool might read #include'd files to determine whether the control macros - those specified by -D or -U on the command line - are defined in those files.  I'm not sure whether that's truly helpful except as a backup diagnostic.  Whatever else it does, though, the pseudo-pre-processor must not expand macros or include files verbatim.  The output must be source similar to, but usually simpler than, the input code.)

Status Report (one year later)

After a year of use, I am very happy with 'sunifdef' recommended by the selected answer.  It hasn't made a mistake yet, and I don't expect it to.  The only quibble I have with it is stylistic.  Given an input such as:

#if (defined(A) &amp;&amp; defined(B)) || defined(C) || (defined(D) &amp;&amp; defined(E))


and run with '-UC' (C is never defined), the output is:

#if defined(A) &amp;&amp; defined(B) || defined(D) &amp;&amp; defined(E)


This is technically correct because '&amp;&amp;' binds tighter than '||', but it is an open invitation to confusion.  I would much prefer it to include parentheses around the sets of '&amp;&amp;' conditions, as in the original:

#if (defined(A) &amp;&amp; defined(B)) || (defined(D) &amp;&amp; defined(E))


However, given the obscurity of some of the code I have to work with, for that to be the biggest nit-pick is a strong compliment; it is valuable tool to me.



The New Kid on the Block

Having checked the URL for inclusion in the information above, I see that (as predicted) there is an new program called Coan that is the successor to 'sunifdef'.  It is available on SourceForge and has been since January 2010.  I'll be checking it out...further reports later this year, or maybe next year, or sometime, or never.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
I know absolutely nothing about C, but it sounds like you are looking for something like unifdef. Note that it hasn't been updated since 2000, but there is a successor called &quot;Son of unifdef&quot; (sunifdef).
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Also you can try this tool http://coan2.sourceforge.net/

something like this will remove ifdef blocks:

coan source -UYOUR_FLAG  --filter c,h --recurse YourSourceTree
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
I used unifdef years ago for just the sort of problem you describe, and it worked fine.  Even if it hasn't been updated since 2000, the syntax of preprocessor ifdefs hasn't changed materially since then, so I expect it will still do what you want.  I suppose there might be some compile problems, although the packages appear recent.

I've never used sunifdef, so I can't comment on it directly.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Around 2004 I wrote a tool that did exactly what you are looking for.  I never got around to distributing the tool, but the code can be found here: 

http://casey.dnsalias.org/exifdef-0.2.zip (that's a dsl link)

It's about 1.7k lines and implements enough of the C grammar to parse preprocessor statements, comments, and strings using bison and flex.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
If you need something similar to a preprocessor, the flexible solution is Wave (from boost). It's a library designed to build C-preprocessor-like tools (including such things as C++03 and C++0x preprocessors). As it's a library, you can hook into its input and output code.

Apologies as I am new to python and vscode. I am transitioning from using Pycharm to VsCode and noted that autocomplete in VsCode is not seemingly as useful as it is in Pycharm. In pycharm, once a function is defined within your project, Pycharm's autocomplete will display all the arguments that function takes. Is that possible in VsCode? Secondly, in PyCharm, even unknown/unimportable modules (such as those defined in an API) will appear as potential completions if that completion has been used somewhere else in the project. Are there "project" level settings in VsCode and is this learning behavior possible through intellisense? thanks!

Description: 
    
    
                    
Up until recently I could select the startup project (equivalent to right-clicking on the project in the solution explorer and choosing "Set as Startup Project") from the Standard toolbar with the "Select Startup Item" drop-down.  Now it's gone, yet the item is still checked under "Add or Remove Buttons".  

The closest reference I could find is this, but the solution doesn't match my situation because I have more than one project and this is happening no matter which solution is loaded.

Please help me figure out what is going on.

I had a similar issue where the start menu item (called &quot;Debug Target&quot;) was completely gone. Toggling the menu item on and off did not resolve the issue. I selected &quot;Reset Toolbar&quot; at the bottom of the menu and that resolved the problem for me. May require some manual set up after if your menu is heavily customized. But if you use the Standard layout it shouldn't be an issue.

    
    
Title: IDE specific SSL Handshake exception
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am getting an SSL Handshake exception when trying to run a code in JDeveloper. However, the exact same code is working fine in Netbeans IDE.

The error is;


  Caused by: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target


I know the error comes most likely when the proper certificate is not present in the truststore. This is not the case here, as I can see the certificate being added as a trusted certificate after enabling the javax.net.debug=ssl logs.
Also, this cannot be a simple case of certificate not being available as the exact same code is working fine on Netbeans with the same truststore and java version.

The code is as follows;

package client;

import javax.ws.rs.client.Client;
import javax.ws.rs.client.ClientBuilder;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.Base64;
import javax.ws.rs.client.Entity;

public class Class1 {
    public Class1() {
        super();
    }
    private static final String resourceUrl = "My/url";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Response headers = null;
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("java.version"));
        System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore","C:\\path\\to\\jks");
        System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword","passphrase");
        System.setProperty("javax.net.debug","ssl");

        try {
            Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
            String auth = "username:password";
            byte[] authBytes = auth.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
            String encodedAuth = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(authBytes);
            String input = "JSON_input_payload";

            headers = client
                  .target(resourceUrl)
                  .request()
                  .header("Authorization", "Basic " + encodedAuth)                   
                  .post(Entity.json(input));
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Response = " + headers);
    }
}



Any ideas?
Perhaps I need to check some IDE specific configuration files? Couldn't figure out what to look for in Jdev config files though, hence posting the question here.

Netbeans version is 8.2

JDev versions I checked this on are 12.2.1.3.0 and 12.2.1.4.0

OS is Windows 10.

The java.version is the same in bothe IDE's, i.e, 1.8.0_151. I also tried running them in the version 1.8.0_221, but got the same results.
    

        
Title: Is it possible to install and enable workspace extensions in vscode with the .vscode folder?
Description: 
    
    
                    
What I want to achieve:


I want my projects to be self-contained in a manner that will allow collaborators to start working on them with all the proper linting and language features etc.. (I know this is a bit harsh in the sense that i am "forcing" an IDE in it, but for the sake of the problem it is helpful.)
I want my projects to be self-contained so that i have full config control over which extensions work and which don't when i approach working on them. I don't want to be depenedant on my own machine with my own vscode user config. I don't want to be dependent on extension I have installed in the past. And i also don't want different extension to be mixed up. I want everything disabled on the global user space and only enabled in controlled manned via some in project setting file.


What I think I basically need:

A VSCode extension manager that can work locally in the dir. Sort of like an npm for vscode.

So i would be able to structure extension "dependencies" and run an install and locally enable the extension to work on the specific workspace.

extension.package

{
  "extensions": {
    "eslint": "6.4^"
    "babel": "15.2^"
  }
}


Then there would be the regular configuration files for these extension available already with the git - and if not perhaps they can be auto-generated with some default settings.

and all the developer would need to do is run some bash code command.



Does something like this exist? Is such a functionality available to achieve?

The only thing that I have found so far that is at least a bit of help is to have recommended extensions for a workspace :S
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_workspace-recommended-extensions


  You can create a recommended list of extensions for a workspace with the Extensions: Configure Recommended Extensions (Workspace) command.
  [...]
  
  An example extensions.json could be:

   {
     "recommendations": [
       "ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin",
       "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
       "msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome"
     ]

Title: Installing PyTorch on PyCharmin dont work anymore
Description: 
    
    
                    
I cant install PyTorch in PyCharm anymore on one of my computers. PyCharm shows me some weird error messages and i was not able to solve this problem.

Im running Python 3.7 with pip 19.0.3.

Everytime i try to use commands like:

pip3 install torch==1.3.0+cpu torchvision==0.4.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html


it ends up with following error message:


  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement
  torch==1.3.0+cpu (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2) No
  matching distribution found for torch==1.3.0+cpu


If i try with this command: 

pip3 install torch 


this error shows up:


  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tools.nnwrap'



I searched for a solution on Google all the time but did not find a solution.
I have reinstalled PyCharm to check out if it was only a bug. The problem is still there.
I reinstalled pip but nothing.


Can you help me?
