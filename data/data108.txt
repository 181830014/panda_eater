Title: VSCode: How to autocomplete only in JSDoc defined properties or classes?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using a framework, that generates automatically properties for classes and even classes can be generated by a define function.

The problem in Visual Studio Code is, that the autocompletion is not working if properties or whole classes are only defined by jsdoc. Or am I wrong? In Webstorm this works.

Example:

/**
 * @description
 * A Person
 *
 * @class
 */
function Person(name) {
    /**
     * @description
     * Name of the person
     * @property {String}
     */
    this.name = name;

    /**
     * @description
     * Another Name of the person
     * @property {String}
     */
    this.anotherName = name;

    /**
     * @description
     * Another Name of the person
     * @property {String}
     * @name Person#AndEvenMoreNames
     */
}

var oPerson = new Person("Peter");
oPerson.


Webstorm now enables autocompletion for all 3 properties, whereas Visual Studio Code only shows autocompletion for name and anotherName.

With classes defined only in JS it is the same...

Is my JSDoc wrong or the settings in VSCode?

~/Desktop/hello&gt; java-introcs Barnsley 10000


but in my idea,it uses cmd.exe so ls should be replaced dir i know
but when i type javac-introcs Barnsley.java
it tells me 

'java-introcs' is not an internal or external command, nor is it a runnable program
Or a batch file.

Answer 1: 

    
    
The output you observed means that you haven't completed the installation of some class-specific programs. The installer for this is mentioned in Section 0 of the link you provided. The most likely cause is that there were some environmental variables that were not modified correctly to add the java-introcs executable or alias to %PATH%. However, you are probably able to replicate the intent of java-introcs, as described below.

To figure out how to make the given Barnsley file compile and run, you'll need to add the dependency StdDraw.class to the classpath when running the file. To do this, you can use the java and javac option -classpath or -cp. You can read more detailed documentation on how to do this here.
    
    
Title: How to only send self-allocated framebuffer to OpenMV IDE?
Description: 
    
    
                    
For a motion detection algorithm on the OpenMV platform, I allocate a second framebuffer, which is being updated every frame.

Now the algorithm works, but I would like to show the result framebuffer in the OpenMV IDE. As shown in this thread, it is working with following line of code:

print(extra_fb.compressed_for_ide(), end="")


Everything works as expected, but the problem I am facing now, is, that the extra_fb framebuffer is shown, and then the internal framebuffer is shown in the IDE. So it always switches from one to the other, which results in a flickering image.

How can I suppress the IDE from displaying the internal framebuffer?

I could not find something about that in the official documentation.

You need to add the mysql driver jar in the classpath before you run the program.

There are various ways to do so.


javac -cp "JAR_PATH" ClassName.java
java -cp "JAR_PATH" ClassName
Add the jar file in C:\Program Files\Java\\jre\lib\ext
set classpath=PATH_TO_JAR;

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm currenty cleaning up my first big R project and at a point, where I have a lot of functions implemented but I am not sure, which function got called and used by me in an other script and which function got never used. So now I want to get all calls of this function in my project. Is this possible? 
I'm using RStudio and a lot of other IDEs I've used got a feature like this, so I was wondering if this is also implemented in RStudio.
I searched the web and stack overflow, but got no answer, so I assume that this is not possible but I wanted to ask, just in case it IS possible but I didn't found the right answer.

Title: Xcode : How to use cmd + x to either cut a line or cut the selected text
Description: 
    
    
                    
Pressing cmd + x without selecting text in other IDEs, cuts the complete line. Same goes for cmd + c which copies, instead of cutting. Otherwise, if some text is selected, only that region is cut.

How do I do this in Xcode?

I added the following in the IDETextKeyBindingSet.plist to add cutting line and copying line functionality:

&lt;key&gt;My Custom Commands&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Cut Current Line&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;selectLine:, cut:&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Copy Current Line&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;selectLine:, copy:&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;


But obviously binding these to cmd + x (or c) doesn't allow cutting/copying selected region. I understand I can set it to some other keybinding. But, as a force of habit, cmd + x (or c) suits better.

Is there any way to do this? Maybe an extension?

Title: PyCharm (Python 3.x) modify a class without re-running the script
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am using PyCharm Pro 2018 and just made the switch to it recently (from Spyder).

The first part of my script involves loading a lot of data and takes about 1-2 minutes. On completion or error of the script I get a python console with all the current variables where I can investigate.

Now if I would like to change a method/function and run it again WITHOUT completely restarting the script, how can I do that?

Here some pseudocode:

class FetchData():
    ...

class ParseData():
    ...
    def subroutine1(self, ...):
        ...

data = FetchData(...) # takes a long time
parser = ParseData(data,...)
parser.subroutine1(...)


After running this code and getting an error in subroutine1, I get a console and can look at "data" and "parser" (as well as any other variables). Is it possible to modify subroutine1 and manually re-run that method in the console "parser.subroutine1(...)" with the changed method and "data" still intact?

If not, or in general, what would be the best practice to code on subroutine1 without having to constantly reload "data = FetchData(...)"?

Thanks a lot!
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
There are 2 ways I have gone about this:

1.) Use a Jupyter Notebook. One of the biggest features/strengths of Notebooks is exactly this ability; to encapsulate parts of your code from each other and if you get an error in later cells/blocks of code, it will not make you start from scratch.

2.) Pickle your data's results and refer to that instead. Python's builtin pickle module has the ability to create "pickle" files which can hold almost any piece of data you have created in your long-running subroutine. So split your code into 2 files, the long-running/data creating one will only create the data and pickle it; run it only when you need to update the data inside the pickle file. The 2nd/subsequent routines you want to run on your data are in a python file that opens/reads the pickle file (which is a very fast action) and then works on the previously stored data inside it.

Just got a "The C programming language, 2nd edition" and I'm struggling to make a solution using Visual Studio 2017 that could hold all exercises I do in one project. I don't want to create a new project for every single exercise in book.
How would I go around creating a solution with either multiple main() or calling upon different .c in main?

Say that first exercise is to create a program printing a conversion table from Fahrenheit to Celsius and next exercise involves using getchar().
Is that manageable in Visual Studio or should I pick another IDE.
    

        
Title: Debug/Run from Visual Studio 2017 very slow after one build
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm working with simple c/c++ console projects in Visual Studio 2017.

After a build, if I run/debug it from within the IDE (Ctrl+F5 or F5), there's always a strange wait of tens of seconds before it actually runs (e.g. if I printf on the first line of my main(), it won't show until after the long "wait")

If there's no build after this first run, and I Ctrl+F5 or F5 again, it runs fast and normal. If then I change some source code and rebuild it, the strange wait appears again.

This slows down the dev iterations so much, and definitely feels wrong. Just wonder if any guru here can point me to a solution/workaround?

Thanks in advance！

Title: How to build a property grid in Angular 2+
Description: 
    
    
                    
I am building an IDE type application in Angular 6 specific to my domain where I need to allow the user to edit properties of C# objects. Think of the Visual Studio property grid for a Windows Forms or Web Forms project where you can click on a button on the form and in the property grid you can change the properties of the button (e.g. color,size,text,etc).

I had the idea of sending a json string to the client that includes the properties of the object with their current values. Something like this:

{
"id":1,
"name":"Volume",
"type":"VolumeCalculator",
"properties":
[
  {
    "name":"NumberOfLevels",
    "type":"int",
    "value":2
  },
  {
    "name":"Period",
    "type":"object",
    "properties":
    [
      {
        "name":"From",
        "type":"DateTime",
        "properties":
        [
          {
            "name":"FromDate",
            "type":"Date",
            "value":"01/01/2018"
          },
          {
            "name":"FromTime",
            "type":"Time",
            "value":"12:00:00"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name":"Until",
        "type":"DateTime",
        "value":"02/01/2018 12:00:00"
      }         
    ]
  },
  {
    "name":"TreeType",
    "type":"enum",
    "value":2,
    "options":["Path Graph","Star Like"]
  }
]
}


With this json string I have all the information I need to build a grid. Different data types will present different editors. A DateTime type would allow the user to click a calendar icon to bring up a calendar and choose a value. An Enum type would present a drop down where the user would pick from the provided values.

Where I am struggling is I am relatively new to Angular 6 development. I have built some simpler applications so I am familiar with beginner level Angular concepts. I think this problem requires a bit more advanced concepts that I am just unfamiliar with so am looking for pointers. Perhaps this should be a directive? Perhaps it is just a component itself and no directive is necessary.

I am not asking for a complete solution (however, if someone wants to provide one I won't complain), just some direction from the Angular experts.

I am even interested in just buying a library that already provides the functionality, but so far I have been unable to find one that supports Angular 6. If anyone knows of one, I am happy to review it to see if it will work for me.
    

        
Title: How to configure PhpStorm to go through IIS url rewrite when debugging a file rather than loading the file directly
Description: 
    
    
                    
My apologies if this is not possible or if I'm asking the wrong question. I'm a little at a loss for even what to search for here.

I have my website configured so that pages are stored outside the root directory. To do this, all traffic is redirected through a controller.php page using url rewrite in IIS.

So the process looks like this: A user goes to www.mywebsite/account/page.php. No matter where the user went, IIS url rewrite redirects the user to wwwroot/controller.php. Controller.php then grabs the ORIGINAL_URI from an environment variable and then builds the page by including the actual page file from includes/pages/[account/page.php] outside the web root. The path is always the same within the includes/pages/ folder as it would be in wwwroot. If it can't find a matching file there, it instead serves a 404 page.

I have debugging working fine with the chrome plugin by refreshing the page, but I was hoping there was a way to click the debug button within PhpStorm or click one of the browser buttons within PhpStorm and have it smart enough to load the page.

Is there a way to have PhpStorm look at the path of the current file I'm editing (includes/pages/account/page.php) and have it start in wwwroot/account/page.php and go through the url rewrite? Or perhaps is there a way to have it start in wwwroot/controller.php no matter what page I am debugging and pass it the path of the page (possibly in an environment variable)?
    

        
Title: Delphi IDE Expert - intercept &ldquo;View Source&rdquo; or DPR-file loading
Description: 
    
    
                    
Trying to tune AutoOpenUnit IDE Expert (implementing I-OTA-IDE-Notifier and implementing FileNotification event) for my Delphi XE2 I stumbled upon a problem...

I need to scan every source file opened by Code Editor (or by IDE itself).

I made a test project: console app (DPR) which uses two units - Unit1.pas and Unit2.pas

I delete the project DSK file or save the project having no files opened in the Code Editor, or only the DPK file alone.

Now, the .DPR file itself is almost never passed do the notifier event.
The only case when it happened - is when I do "Open Project" and specify it.

However when I do File/Reopen - it is DRPOJ-file signalled as opened, but not the DPR-file.
When I restart the IDE with the project pre-opened, it again 'opens' the DPROJ file, 'skipping' the DPR-file.

There go notifications like Active Project changed.
There even go "file opening" notifications for project DSK file and for default empty Project Group file. But not for the project source file.

Here I can come with a crude hack, to extract project name from the DPROJ-file and to "notify" myself. Though is it the fact, that IDE would not fire some "normal" event for it???

Yet worse. If I have the project opened (but the project DPR file closed), and then I do the View Source action - then while Code Editor opens the new tab for the project still there is no ANY event coming to the expert.

Is there a way to surely get notified by the IDE when the new tab with the project root file is being opened in the Code Editor?

UPD. I found iOTAEditorNotifier, now trying to read CnWizards how they manage to utilize it, as there seems to be no registering calls for that interface in IDE OTA...
