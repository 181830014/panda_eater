Does IntelliJ IDEA support highlights errors of JSP files in the project window like Netbeans or Eclipse?

If it does, how to enable it?

Title: Delphi project asks to save without making changes
Description: 
    
    
                    
Every time I open the project group without making any changes, the save button is enabled and when I close the projects, IDE always asks to save one of the projects.

Of the three projects of the group, with only one of them, and always with the same thing happens.

And it happens every time I log in .groupproj or .dpr in question, however much I have not made any changs.

By checking the project files, after clicking "yes" to save the "changes", the files remain identical, except for the .identcache, which has small changes each time the project is opened.

This is disrupting me in a process that I need to run periodically, so I would like to resolve.

recently I have been trying to run the Netbeans IDE on Mac OS X El Capitan on a 13 in MacBook Pro (2015). However, while the program launches with no visible error output, whenever I attempt to create a new project or access a project, no directory structure shows up on the left, and no window is opened. 

Here is the output from java --version in the terminal, in case this helps.

Title: Delphi IDE - Insert text on every selected line (as with vim&#39;s block select mode)?
Description: 
    
    
                    
In Delphi's IDE (RAD Studio) one can do column/block select like in vim with Alt+Shift+Arrows. This is useful to delete things in a column oriented way, but when inserting text it only gets added to the cursor position, not to the cursor position on every selected line, as one would expect coming from vim. Is there any way to insert text on every selected line or at least to replace a selection with something?
    

        
Title: Type hinting in Javascript
Description: 
    
    
                    
In PHP, I remember it was possible to do this (this is using Symfony2):

use AppBundle\Entity\AccountUser;

/** @var AccountUser $user */
$user = $em-&gt;getRepository('AppBundle:AccountUser')

$user-&gt; ...hints...


And the IDE would recognise $user as an AccountUser object and pull information through for typehinting.

Is this possible in Javascript too? I'm thinking for dependencies from the node_modules folder more specifically:

const aws = require('aws-sdk');

/**
 * @type {Object} DocumentClient
 */
const db = new aws.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

db. ...hints...

Title: How to collapse only and only regions in entire solution? [duplicate]
Description: 
    
    
                    
There's a number of keyboard shortcuts and menu commands to automatically expand or collapse all foldables in the current document. Ctrl+M,
 Ctrl+L toggles all foldables recursively, from the top namespace down to the inner methods and comments. Basically everything that has a [+] icon in the left margin. Ctrl+M, Ctrl+O does it bit less, but it still touches methods and comments inside the class.

I'm looking for a function that specifically only regards #region foldables and nothing else. Not namespaces, classes, comments, or methods. I really only want to fold those areas that are explicitly marked as such with the #region keyword.

Is there any hidden shortcut or an extension for that?

I'd prefer a keyboard solution, for Visual Studio 2015 (RC for now).

In case somebody asks why: I want to get an overview of the file, but immediately see all the details when I decide to look inside one region.

Ctrl+M+O will collapse all.

Ctrl+M+L will expand all. (in VS 2013 - Toggle All outlining)

Ctrl+M+P will expand all and disable outlining.

Ctrl+M+M will collapse/expand the current section.

These options are also in the context menu under Outlining.

The Visual Studio extension Productivity Power Tools 2015 from Microsoft has a feature called Quick Launch Tasks that adds new commands to the Quick Launch menu. One of them is CollapseRegions and it does exactly that.

The opposite command is ExpandRegions and it expands all regions for quick browsing of the entire file. These commands can be used pretty quickly by pressing the CtrlQ hotkey and typing Coll resp. Exp, then pressing Enter (supposed you don't have other commands with the same prefix).

Looks like the closest thing is Ctrl+M, Ctrl+S

Which will collapse the current region you are in, while Ctrl+M, Ctrl+E will expand the current region you are in.

I know this is an old question, but here's an update for visual studio 2019:

The Quick Tasks solution from @ygoe's answer does not work for Visual Studio 2019, because that version changed the way the Quick Task bar searches. Plus it was never the preferred solution to the original question, since you needed to type a quick action instead of having a keyboard shortcut.

I found a different solution on the marketplace which does exactly the collapsing and expanding of all regions in the currently opened file with keyboard shortcuts: Collapse Region

From the extension page:


  Default key bindings are (Ctrl+R, Ctrl+Num+) and (Ctrl+R, Ctrl+Num-).

Title: Visual Studio 2017 JavaScript Comment Auto Formatting
Description: 
    
    
                    
When I create a comment in Visual Studio 2017 inside a JavaScript file (.js) the automatic formatting of comments is different than how they are formatted when I am using C#. While a small issue, it would save some time in the long run to solve and figure out if this is possible in Visual Studio

In a C# file, when I type: /* and press enter, another asterisk is automatically created as well as a space before the asterisk, so they all are on the same line, as well as a space after the asterisk which is where my cursor ultimately ends up. 

Example in C#:

/*
 * 


However, in JavaScript when I start a comment by typing /* and press enter the cursor simply moves to the next line. No spaces or asterisks are created. 

Example in JavaScript:

/*
[Nothing is automatically created on this line after pressing enter.]


We are in the process of updating our JavaScript core libraries to use YUIDoc and will be adding a good deal of comments such as:

/**
 * My JavaScript application
 * 
 * @module myapp
 */


Having intellisense add the extra space and asterisk on enter would be a big time saver. I've reviewed the various settings in the Tools
