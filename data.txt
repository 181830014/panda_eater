Title: Which @NotNull Java annotation should I use?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm looking to make my code more readable as well as use tooling like IDE code inspection and/or static code analysis (FindBugs and Sonar) to avoid NullPointerExceptions.  Many of the tools seem incompatible with each others' @NotNull/@NonNull/@Nonnull annotation and listing all of them in my code would be terrible to read.  Any suggestions of which one is the 'best'?  Here is the list of equivalent annotations I've found:


javax.validation.constraints.NotNull
Created for runtime validation, not static analysis.
documentation
edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.NonNull
Used by Findbugs static analysis and therefore Sonar (now Sonarqube)
documentation
javax.annotation.Nonnull
This might work with Findbugs too, but JSR-305 is inactive. (See also: What is the status of JSR 305?)
source
org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull
Used by IntelliJ IDEA IDE for static analysis.
documentation
lombok.NonNull
Used to control code generation in Project Lombok.
Placeholder annotation since there is no standard.
source, 
documentation
android.support.annotation.NonNull
Marker annotation available in Android, provided by support-annotations package
documentation
org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.NonNull
Used by Eclipse for static code analysis

Answer 1: 

    
    
Since JSR 305 (whose goal was to standardize @NonNull and @Nullable) has been dormant for several years, I'm afraid there is no good answer. All we can do is to find a pragmatic solution and mine is as follows:

Syntax

From a purely stylistic standpoint I would like to avoid any reference to IDE, framework or any toolkit except Java itself.

This rules out:


android.support.annotation
edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations
org.eclipse.jdt.annotation
org.jetbrains.annotations
org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual
lombok.NonNull


Which leaves us with either javax.validation.constraints or javax.annotation.
The former comes with JEE. If this is better than javax.annotation, which  might come eventually with JSE or never at all, is a matter of debate.
I personally prefer javax.annotation because I wouldn't like the JEE dependency.

This leaves us with

javax.annotation

which is also the shortest one.

There is only one syntax which would even be better: java.annotation.Nullable. As other packages graduated
from javax to java in the past, the javax.annotation would
be a step in the right direction.

Implementation

I was hoping that they all have basically the same trivial implementation,
but a detailed analysis showed that this is not true.

First for the similarities:

The @NonNull annotations all have the line 

public @interface NonNull {}


except for 


org.jetbrains.annotations which calls it @NotNull and has a trivial implementation
javax.annotation which has a longer implementation
javax.validation.constraints which also calls it @NotNull and has an implementation


The @Nullableannotations all have the line

public @interface Nullable {}


except for (again) the org.jetbrains.annotations with their trivial implementation.

For the differences:

A striking one is that


javax.annotation
javax.validation.constraints
org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual


all have runtime annotations (@Retention(RUNTIME)), while


android.support.annotation
edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations
org.eclipse.jdt.annotation
org.jetbrains.annotations


are only compile time (@Retention(CLASS)).

As described in this SO answer the impact of runtime annotations
is smaller than one might think, but they have the benefit
of enabling tools to do runtime checks in addition to the
compile time ones. 

Another important difference is where in the code the annotations can be used.
There are two different approaches. Some packages use JLS 9.6.4.1 style contexts. The following table gives an overview:



                                FIELD   METHOD  PARAMETER LOCAL_VARIABLE 
android.support.annotation      X       X       X   
edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations X       X       X         X
org.jetbrains.annotation        X       X       X         X
lombok                          X       X       X         X
javax.validation.constraints    X       X       X   


org.eclipse.jdt.annotation, javax.annotation and org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual use the contexts defined in 
JLS 4.11, which is in my opinion the right way to do it.

This leaves us with 


javax.annotation
org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual


in this round.

Code

To help you to compare further details yourself I list the code of every annotation below.
To make comparison easier I removed comments, imports and the @Documented annotation.
(they all had @Documented except for the classes from the Android package).
I reordered the lines and @Target fields and normalized the qualifications.

package android.support.annotation;
@Retention(CLASS)
@Target({FIELD, METHOD, PARAMETER})
public @interface NonNull {}




package edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations;
@Retention(CLASS)
@Target({FIELD, METHOD, PARAMETER, LOCAL_VARIABLE})
public @interface NonNull {}




package org.eclipse.jdt.annotation;
@Retention(CLASS)
@Target({ TYPE_USE })
public @interface NonNull {}




package org.jetbrains.annotations;
@Retention(CLASS)
@Target({FIELD, METHOD, PARAMETER, LOCAL_VARIABLE})
public @interface NotNull {String value() default "";}




package javax.annotation;
@TypeQualifier
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Nonnull {
    When when() default When.ALWAYS;
    static class Checker implements TypeQualifierValidator&lt;Nonnull&gt; {
        public When forConstantValue(Nonnull qualifierqualifierArgument,
                Object value) {
            if (value == null)
                return When.NEVER;
            return When.ALWAYS;
        }
    }
}




package org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual;
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({TYPE_USE, TYPE_PARAMETER})
@SubtypeOf(MonotonicNonNull.class)
@ImplicitFor(
    types = {
        TypeKind.PACKAGE,
        TypeKind.INT,
        TypeKind.BOOLEAN,
        TypeKind.CHAR,
        TypeKind.DOUBLE,
        TypeKind.FLOAT,
        TypeKind.LONG,
        TypeKind.SHORT,
        TypeKind.BYTE
    },
    literals = {LiteralKind.STRING}
)
@DefaultQualifierInHierarchy
@DefaultFor({TypeUseLocation.EXCEPTION_PARAMETER})
@DefaultInUncheckedCodeFor({TypeUseLocation.PARAMETER, TypeUseLocation.LOWER_BOUND})
public @interface NonNull {}




For completeness, here are the @Nullable implementations:

package android.support.annotation;
@Retention(CLASS)
@Target({METHOD, PARAMETER, FIELD})
public @interface Nullable {}




package edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations;
@Target({FIELD, METHOD, PARAMETER, LOCAL_VARIABLE})
@Retention(CLASS)
public @interface Nullable {}




package org.eclipse.jdt.annotation;
@Retention(CLASS)
@Target({ TYPE_USE })
public @interface Nullable {}




package org.jetbrains.annotations;
@Retention(CLASS)
@Target({FIELD, METHOD, PARAMETER, LOCAL_VARIABLE})
public @interface Nullable {String value() default "";}




package javax.annotation;
@TypeQualifierNickname
@Nonnull(when = When.UNKNOWN)
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Nullable {}




package org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual;
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({TYPE_USE, TYPE_PARAMETER})
@SubtypeOf({})
@ImplicitFor(
    literals = {LiteralKind.NULL},
    typeNames = {java.lang.Void.class}
)
@DefaultInUncheckedCodeFor({TypeUseLocation.RETURN, TypeUseLocation.UPPER_BOUND})
public @interface Nullable {}


The following two packages have no @Nullable, so I list them separately; Lombok has a pretty boring @NonNull.
In javax.validation.constraints the @NonNull is actually a @NotNull
and it has a longish implementation.

package lombok;
@Retention(CLASS)
@Target({FIELD, METHOD, PARAMETER, LOCAL_VARIABLE})
public @interface NonNull {}




package javax.validation.constraints;
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({ FIELD, METHOD, ANNOTATION_TYPE, CONSTRUCTOR, PARAMETER })
@Constraint(validatedBy = {})
public @interface NotNull {
    String message() default "{javax.validation.constraints.NotNull.message}";
    Class&lt;?&gt;[] groups() default { };
    Class&lt;? extends Payload&gt;[] payload() default {};
    @Target({ METHOD, FIELD, ANNOTATION_TYPE, CONSTRUCTOR, PARAMETER })
    @Retention(RUNTIME)
    @Documented
    @interface List {
        NotNull[] value();
    }
}




Support

From my experience, javax.annotation is at least supported by Eclipse and the Checker Framework out of the box.

Summary

My ideal annotation would be the java.annotation syntax with the Checker Framework implementation.

If you don't intend to use the Checker Framework the javax.annotation (JSR-305) is still your best bet for the time being.

If you are willing to buy into the Checker Framework just use
their org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual.

I very much like the Checker Framework, which is an implementation of type annotations (JSR-308) which is used to implement defect checkers like a nullness checker.  I haven't really tried any others to offer any comparison, but I've been happy with this implementation.

I'm not affiliated with the group that offers the software, but I am a fan.

Four things I like about this system:


It has a defect checkers for nullness (@Nullable), but also has ones for immutability and interning (and others).  I use the first one (nullness) and I'm trying to get into using the second one (immutability/IGJ).  I'm trying out the third one, but I'm not certain about using it long term yet.  I'm not convinced of the general usefulness of the other checkers yet, but its nice to know that the framework itself is a system for implementing a variety of additional annotations and checkers.
The default setting for nullness checking works well: Non-null except locals (NNEL).  Basically this means that by default the checker treats everyhing (instance variables, method parameters, generic types, etc) except local variables as if they have a @NonNull type by default.  Per the documentation:


  The NNEL default leads to the smallest number of explicit annotations in your code.


You can set a different default for a class or for a method if NNEL doesn't work for you.
This framework allows you to use with without creating a dependency on the framework by enclosing your annotations in a comment: e.g. /*@Nullable*/.  This is nice because you can annotate and check a library or shared code, but still be able to use that library/shared coded in another project that doesn't use the framework.  This is a nice feature.  I've grown accustom to using it, even though I tend to enable the Checker Framework on all my projects now. 
The framework has a way to annotate APIs you use that aren't already annotated for nullness by using stub files.

I use the IntelliJ one, because I'm mostly concerned with IntelliJ flagging things that might produce a NPE. I agree that it's frustrating not having a standard annotation in the JDK. There's talk of adding it, it might make it into Java 7. In which case there will be one more to choose from!
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
According to the Java 7 features list JSR-308 type annotations are deferred to Java 8.  JSR-305 annotations are not even mentioned.  

There is a bit of info on the state of JSR-305 in an appendix of the latest JSR-308 draft.  This includes the observation that JSR-305 annotations seem to be abandoned.  The JSR-305 page also shows it as "inactive".

In the mean time, the pragmatic answer is to use the annotation types that are supported by the most widely used tools ... and be prepared to change them if the situation changes.



In fact, JSR-308 does not define any annotation types/classes, and it looks like they think it is out of scope.  (And they are right, given the existence of JSR-305).

However, if JSR-308 really looks like making it into Java 8, it wouldn't surprise me if interest in JSR-305 revived.  AFAIK, the JSR-305 team hasn't formally abandoned their work.  They have just been quiet for 2+ years.

It is interesting that Bill Pugh (the tech lead for JSR-305) is one of the guy behind FindBugs.

For Android projects you should use android.support.annotation.NonNull and android.support.annotation.Nullable. These and other helpful Android-specific annotations are available in the Support Library.

From http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/support-annotations:


  The support library itself has also been annotated with these
  annotations, so as a user of the support library, Android Studio will
  already check your code and flag potential problems based on these
  annotations.

If anyone is just looking for the IntelliJ classes: you can get them from the maven repository with

&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.jetbrains&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;annotations&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;15.0&lt;/version&gt;

JSR305 and FindBugs are authored by the same person. Both are poorly maintained but are as standard as it gets and are supported by all major IDEs. The good news is that they work well as-is.

Here is how to apply @Nonnull to all classes, methods and fields by default.
See https://stackoverflow.com/a/13319541/14731 and https://stackoverflow.com/a/9256595/14731


Define @NotNullByDefault




import java.lang.annotation.Documented;
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import javax.annotation.Nonnull;
import javax.annotation.meta.TypeQualifierDefault;


    /**
     * This annotation can be applied to a package, class or method to indicate that the class fields,
     * method return types and parameters in that element are not null by default unless there is: &lt;ul&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;An explicit nullness annotation &lt;li&gt;The method overrides a method in a superclass (in which
     * case the annotation of the corresponding parameter in the superclass applies) &lt;li&gt; there is a
     * default parameter annotation applied to a more tightly nested element. &lt;/ul&gt;
     * &lt;p/&gt;
     * @see https://stackoverflow.com/a/9256595/14731
     */
    @Documented
    @Nonnull
    @TypeQualifierDefault(
    {
        ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE,
        ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR,
        ElementType.FIELD,
        ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE,
        ElementType.METHOD,
        ElementType.PACKAGE,
        ElementType.PARAMETER,
        ElementType.TYPE
    })
    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
    public @interface NotNullByDefault
    {
    }


2. Add the annotation to each package: package-info.java



@NotNullByDefault
package com.example.foo;


UPDATE: As of December 12th, 2012 JSR 305 is listed as "Dormant". According to the documentation:


  A JSR that was voted as "dormant" by the Executive Committee, or one that has reached the end of its natural lifespan.


It looks like JSR 308 is making it into JDK 8 and although the JSR does not define @NotNull, the accompanying Checkers Framework does. At the time of this writing, the Maven plugin is unusable due to this bug: https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/issues/183
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
Distinguish between static analysis and runtime analysis. Use static analysis for internal stuff, and runtime analysis for the public boundaries of your code.

For things that should not be null:


Runtime check: Use "if (x == null) ..." (zero dependency) or @javax.validation.NotNull (with bean validation) or @lombok.NonNull (plain and simple) or guavas Preconditions.checkNotNull(...)


Use Optional for method return types (only). Either Java8 or Guava.

Static check: Use an @NonNull annotation
Where it fits, use  @...NonnullByDefault annotations on class or package level. Create these annotations yourself (examples are easy to find).


Else, use @...CheckForNull on method returns to avoid NPEs



This should give the best result: warnings in the IDE, errors by Findbugs and checkerframework, meaningful runtime exceptions.

Do not expect static checks to be mature, their naming is not standardized and different libraries and IDEs treat them differently, ignore them. The JSR305 javax.annotations.* classes look like standard, but they are not, and they cause split packages with Java9+.

Some notes explanations:


Findbugs/spotbugs/jsr305 annotations with package javax.validation.* clash with other modules in Java9+, also possibly violate Oracle license
Spotbugs annotations still depends on jsr305/findbugs annotations at compiletime (at the time of writing https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/issues/421)
jetbrains @NotNull name conflicts with @javax.validation.NotNull.
jetbrains, eclipse or checkersframework annotations for static checking have the advantage over javax.annotations that they do not clash with other modules in Java9 and higher
@javax.annotations.Nullable does not mean to Findbugs/Spotbugs what you (or your IDE) think it means. Findbugs will ignore it (on members). Sad, but true (https://sourceforge.net/p/findbugs/bugs/1181)
For static checking outside an IDE, 2 free tools exist: Spotbugs(formerly Findbugs) and checkersframework.
The Eclipse library has @NonNullByDefault, jsr305 only has @ParametersAreNonnullByDefault. Those are mere convenience wrappers applying base annotations to everything in a package (or class), you can easily create your own. This can be used on package. This may conflict with generated code (e.g. lombok).
Using lombok as an exported dependency should be avoided for libraries that you share with other people, the less transitive dependencies, the better
Using Bean validation framework is powerful, but requires high overhead, so that's overkill just to avoid manual null checking.
Using Optional for fields and method parameters is controversial (you can find articles about it easily)
Android null annotations are part of the Android support library, they come with a whole lot of other classes, and don't play nicely with other annotations/tools


Before Java9, this is my recommendation:

// file: package-info.java
@javax.annotation.ParametersAreNonnullByDefault
package example;


// file: PublicApi
package example;

public interface PublicApi {

    Person createPerson(
        // NonNull by default due to package-info.java above
        String firstname,
        String lastname);
}

// file: PublicApiImpl
public class PublicApiImpl implements PublicApi {
    public Person createPerson(
            // In Impl, handle cases where library users still pass null
            @Nullable String firstname, // Users  might send null
            @Nullable String lastname // Users might send null
            ) {
        if (firstname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);
        if (lastname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);
        return doCreatePerson(fistname, lastname, nickname);
    }

    @NonNull // Spotbugs checks that method cannot return null
    private Person doCreatePerson(
             String firstname, // Spotbugs checks null cannot be passed, because package has ParametersAreNonnullByDefault
             String lastname,
             @Nullable String nickname // tell Spotbugs null is ok
             ) {
         return new Person(firstname, lastname, nickname);
    }

    @CheckForNull // Do not use @Nullable here, Spotbugs will ignore it, though IDEs respect it
    private Person getNickname(
         String firstname,
         String lastname) {
         return NICKNAMES.get(firstname + ':' + lastname);
    }
}


Note that there is no way to make Spotbugs raise a warning when a nullable method parameter is dereferenced (at the time of writing, version 3.1 of Spotbugs). Maybe checkerframework can do that.

Sadly these annotations do not distinguish between the cases of a public method of a library with arbitrary callsites, and non-public methods where each callsite can be known. So the double meaning of: "Indicate that null is undesired, but prepare for null being passed nevertheless" is not possible in a single declaration, hence the above example has different annotations for the interface and the implementation.

For cases where the split interface approach is not practical, the following approach is a compromise:

        public Person createPerson(
                @NonNull String firstname,
                @NonNull String lastname
                ) {
            // even though parameters annotated as NonNull, library clients might call with null.
            if (firstname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);
            if (lastname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);
            return doCreatePerson(fistname, lastname, nickname);
        }


This helps clients to not pass null (writing correct code), while returning useful errors if they do.

Eclipse has also its own annotations.

org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.NonNull


See at http://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_Core/Null_Analysis for details.
    
    
Answer 10: 

    
    
Just pointing out that the Java Validation API (javax.validation.constraints.*) doesn't come with a @Nullable annotation, which is very valuable in a static analysis context. It makes sense for runtime bean validation as this is the default for any non-primitive field in Java (i.e. nothing to validate/enforce). For the purposes stated that should weigh towards the alternatives.
    
    
Answer 11: 

    
    
Unfortunately, JSR 308 will not add more values than this project local Not Null suggestion here

Java 8 will not come with a single default annotation or its own Checker framework.
Similar to Find-bugs or JSR 305, this JSR is poorly maintained by a small bunch of mostly academic teams. 

No commercial power behind it, thus JSR 308 launches EDR 3 (Early Draft Review at JCP) NOW, while Java 8 is supposed to ship in less than 6 months:-O
Similar to 310 btw. but unlike 308 Oracle has taken charge of that now away from its founders to minimize harm it'll do to the Java Platform.

Every project, vendor and academic class like the ones behind the Checker Framework and JSR 308 will create its own proprietary checker annotation.

Making source code incompatible for years to come, until a few popular compromises could be found and maybe added to Java 9 or 10, or via frameworks like Apache Commons or Google Guava;-)

Android

This answer is Android specific. Android has support package called support-annotations. This provides dozens of Android specific annotations and also provides common ones like NonNull, Nullable etc.

To add support-annotations package, add the following dependency in your build.gradle:

compile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:23.1.1'


and then use:

import android.support.annotation.NonNull;

void foobar(@NonNull Foo bar) {}

While waiting for this to be sorted out upstream (Java 8?), you could also just define your own project-local @NotNull and @Nullable annotations. This can be useful also in case you're working with Java SE, where javax.validation.constraints isn't available by default.

import java.lang.annotation.*;

/**
 * Designates that a field, return value, argument, or variable is
 * guaranteed to be non-null.
 */
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE})
@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)
public @interface NotNull {}

/**
 * Designates that a field, return value, argument, or variable may be null.
 */
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE})
@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)
public @interface Nullable {}


This would admittedly largely be for decorative or future-proofing purposes, since the above obviously doesn't in and of itself add any support for the static analysis of these annotations.
    
    
Answer 14: 

    
    
If you're developing for android, you're somewhat tied to Eclipse (edit: at time of writing, not anymore), which has its own annotations.  It's included in Eclipse 3.8+ (Juno), but disabled by default.

You can enable it at Preferences 
Answer 15: 

    
    
If you are working on a big project, you may be better of creating your own @Nullable and/or @NotNull annotations.
For example:
@java.lang.annotation.Documented
@java.lang.annotation.Retention(java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.CLASS)
@java.lang.annotation.Target({java.lang.annotation.ElementType.FIELD,

public @interface Nullable

If you use the correct retention policy, then the annotations won't be available at runtime. From that point of view, it is just an internal thing.
Even though this is not a strict science, I think it makes most sense to use an internal class for it.

It is an internal thing. (no functional or technical impact)
With many many many usages.
IDE's like IntelliJ support custom @Nullable/@NotNull annotations.
Most frameworks prefer to use their own internal version as well.

There are already too many answers here, but (a) it's 2019, and there's still no "standard" Nullable and (b) no other answer references Kotlin.

The reference to Kotlin is important, because Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java and it has a core Null Safety feature. When calling Java libraries, it can take advantage of those annotations to let Kotlin tools know if a Java API can accept or return null.

As far as I know, the only Nullable packages compatible with Kotlin are org.jetbrains.annotations and android.support.annotation (now androidx.annotation). The latter is only compatible with Android so it can't be used in non-Android JVM/Java/Kotlin projects. However, the JetBrains package works everywhere.

So if you develop Java packages that should also work in Android and Kotlin (and be supported by Android Studio and IntelliJ), your best choice is probably the JetBrains package.

Maven:

&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.jetbrains&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;annotations-java5&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;15.0&lt;/version&gt;

There is another way to do this in Java 8.
I am doing 2 things to accomplish what I needed:

Making nullable fields explicit with types by wrapping nullable fields with java.util.Optional
Checking that all non nullable fields are not null at construction time with java.util.Objects.requireNonNull

Example:
Edit: Disregard this 1st example, I'm just leaving here as context of the comments conversation. Skip to recommended option after this (2nd code block).
    import static java.util.Objects.requireNonNull;

    public class Role {

      private final UUID guid;
      private final String domain;
      private final String name;
      private final Optional&lt;String&gt; description;

      public Role(UUID guid, String domain, String name, Optional&lt;String&gt; description) {
        this.guid = requireNonNull(guid);
        this.domain = requireNonNull(domain);
        this.name = requireNonNull(name);
        this.description = requireNonNull(description);
      }

So my question is, do we even need to annotate when using java 8?
Edit: I found out later that some consider a bad practice to use Optional in arguments, there is a good discussion with pros and cons here Why should Java 8&#39;s Optional not be used in arguments
Recommended option given that it is not best practice to use Optional in arguments, we need 2 constructors:
  //Non null description
  public Role(UUID guid, String domain, String name, String description) {
        this.guid = requireNonNull(guid);
        this.domain = requireNonNull(domain);
        this.name = requireNonNull(name);

        // description will never be null
        requireNonNull(description);

        // but wrapped with an Optional
        this.description = Optional.of(description);
      }

  // Null description is assigned to Optional.empty
  public Role(UUID guid, String domain, String name) {
        this.guid = requireNonNull(guid);
        this.domain = requireNonNull(domain);
        this.name = requireNonNull(name);
        this.description = Optional.empty();

Answer 18: 

    
    
If you are building your application using Spring Framework I would suggest using javax.validation.constraints.NotNull comming from Beans Validation  packaged in following dependency:

    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;javax.validation&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;validation-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;1.1.0.Final&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;


The main advantage of this annotation is that Spring provides support for both method parameters and class fields annotated with javax.validation.constraints.NotNull. All you need to do to enable support is:


supply the api jar for beans validation and jar with implementation of validator of jsr-303/jsr-349 annotations (which comes with Hibernate Validator 5.x dependency):

&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;javax.validation&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;validation-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.1.0.Final&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.hibernate&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;hibernate-validator&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;5.4.1.Final&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;

provide MethodValidationPostProcessor to spring's context

  @Configuration
  @ValidationConfig
  public class ValidationConfig implements MyService {

        @Bean
        public MethodValidationPostProcessor providePostProcessor() {
              return new MethodValidationPostProcessor()
        }
  }

finally you annotate your classes with Spring's org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated and validation will be automatically handled by Spring.


Example:

@Service
@Validated
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {

  @Override
  public Something doSomething(@NotNull String myParameter) {
        // No need to do something like assert myParameter != null  
  }
}


When you try calling method doSomething and pass null as the parameter value, spring (by means of HibernateValidator) will throw ConstraintViolationException. No need for manuall work here.

You can also validate return values.

Another important benefit of javax.validation.constraints.NotNull comming for Beans Validation Framework is that at the moment it is still developed and new features are planned for new version 2.0.

What about @Nullable? There is nothing like that in Beans Validation 1.1. Well, I could arguee that if you decide to use @NotNull than everything which is NOT annotated with @NonNull is effectively "nullable", so the @Nullable annotation is useless.

This seems to be packaged with all the versions of Java I've used within the last few years.

Answer 20: 

    
    
One of the nice things about IntelliJ is that you don't need to use their annotations. You can write your own, or you can use those of whatever other tool you like. You're not even limited to a single type. If you're using two libraries that use different @NotNull annotations, you can tell IntelliJ to use both of them. To do this, go to "Configure Inspections", click on the "Constant Conditions &amp; Exceptions" inspection, and hit the "Configure inspections" button. I use the Nullness Checker wherever I can, so I set up IntelliJ to use those annotations, but you can make it work with whatever other tool you want. (I have no opinion on the other tools because I've been using IntelliJ's inspections for years, and I love them.)
    
    
Answer 21: 

    
    
Another option is the annotations provided with ANTLR 4. Following Pull Request #434, the artifact containing the @NotNull and @Nullable annotations includes an annotation processor that produces compile-time errors and/or warnings in the event one of these attributes is misused (for example, if both are applied to the same item, or if @Nullable is applied to item with a primitive type). The annotation processor provides additional assurance during the software development process that the information conveyed by the application of these annotations is accurate, including in cases of method inheritance.

Spring 5 has @NonNullApi at the package level. This seems like a convenient choice for a project that already has Spring dependencies. All fields, parameters and return values default to @NonNull and @Nullable can be applied in the few places that differ.

Title: How do I &ldquo;Add Existing Item&rdquo; an entire directory structure in Visual Studio?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any C# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure.

I want to add them in that format to a different directory in an ASP.NET web application I am working on; while retaining the same structure. So, I copied the folder into the target location of my project and I tried to “add existing  item” only to lose the previous folder hierarchy.

Usually I have re-created the directories by hand, copied across on a one-to-one basis, and then added existing items. There are simply too many directories/items in this case.

So how do you add existing directories and files in Visual Studio 2008?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Drag the files / folders from Windows Explorer into the Solution Explorer. It will add them all. Note this doesn't work if Visual Studio is in Administrator Mode, because Windows Explorer is a User Mode process.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Enable "Show All Files" for the specific project (you might need to hit "Refresh" to see them)**.  

The folders/files that are not part of your project appear slightly "lighter" in the project tree.  

Right click the folders/files you want to add and click "Include In Project". It will recursively add folders/files to the project.

** These buttons are located on the mini Solution Explorer toolbar.

** Make sure you are NOT in debug mode.

do not do what the question asked for:

Include in project while preserving the directory structure.

At least not in my case (C++/CLI project Visual Studio 2013 on Windows&nbsp;7).

In Visual Studio, once you are back in the normal view (not Show All Files), the files you added are all listed at the top level of the project.

Yes, on disk they still reside where they were, but in Solution Explorer they are loose.

I did not find a way around it except recreating the directory structure in Solution Explorer and then doing Add Existing Items at the right location.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
I didn't immediately understand this based upon these descriptions but here is what I finally stumbled on:


Turn on "Show All Files" - there is an icon on the Solution Explorer toolbar
Using Windows Explorer (not solution explorer), move your files into the directory structure where you want them to reside
Click "Refresh" also on the Solution Explorer toolbar
The files that you've moved should be visible "ghosted" in the Solution Explorer tree structure where you've placed them
Right click on your ghosted files or folders and click "Include in Project". All the contents of a folder will be included

You can change your project XML to add existing subfolders and structures automatically into your project like "node_modules" from NPM:

   &lt;Item Include="$([System.IO.Directory]::GetFiles(&amp;quot;$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\node_modules&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;,SearchOption.AllDirectories))"&gt;&lt;/Item&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;


For the current MSBuild / Visual Studio versions:

Just put it in the nodes of the xml:

&lt;Project&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;


In this case just change $(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\node_modules to your folder name.

The cleanest way that I've found to do this is to create a new Class Library project in the target folder, and redirect all of its build output elsewhere.

It has been a while since this was originally posted, but here is an alternative answer.
If you only care to be able to look at the physical files from inside visual studio and do not necessarily require to see them in the solution explorer default view, then click on the switch view button and choose the folder view and any physical directory/directories that are under your solution root folder will appear here even if they do not appear in the solution explorer default view.

If however, you want to add a folder tree that isn't too large as a virtual solution directory/directories to match your existing tree structure, do that and and then &quot;add the existing&quot; physical files to the virtual directory/directories.  If the physical directory exists in your solution directory it will not copy the files - it will link directly to the physical files but they will appear as part of the solution virtual directories.

Another thing to check is if your project is using the specified (1.8.0_171 in this case) JDK.

The answer is CTRL + P (NOT CTRL + Q)

Someone else posted this answer on JetBrains forum:
The idea is a different IDE. Try to discover its features and try to make the best of it, rather than trying to emulate whatever you used before.
For the most part, Idea has very high usability (much better than Eclipse IMHO) and is streamlined for supporting code editing as best as possible (rather than relying on wizards too much for example).


Javadoc: Ctrl-Q 
A quick view of the implementation:  Ctrl-Shift-I
Show context:  Alt-Q
Show parameters (in a method call):  Ctrl-P
Show error description.  Ctrl-F1


... plus many more shortcuts to navigate in code and different idea views.

I think it rather nice that you can see just the specific bit of information you are interested in with a simple keystroke.
Have a look at the menus which will also show the possibly modified shortcuts for your keymap.

And, elsandros, in addition to what Stephen writes: Since you seem to be interested in IDEA's keyboard shortcuts, I highly recommend the "Key Promoter" plugin which helps you memorize the relevant shortcuts quickly.

Also very useful is the "Goto Action" feature, invoked by Ctrl-Shift-A. In the popup, you can enter a keyword (e.g. "Javadoc"), and the IDE tells you the available actions matching your search, along with keyboard shortcuts and the containing action groups (which often also give you a clue about how to navigate to the action using the menu).
    
    
Title: Eclipse/Java code completion not working
Description: 
    
    
                    
I've downloaded, unzipped and setup Eclipse 3.4.2 with some plugins (noteable, EPIC, Clearcase, QuantumDB, MisterQ). 

Now I find when I'm editing Java projects the code completion is not working.  If I type String. and press ctrl+space a popup shows "No Default Proposals" and the status bar at the bottom shows "No completions available".

Any ideas?

Try restoring the default options in 'Windows &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Editor &gt; Content Assist &gt; Advanced'

An example of the kind of data you see in this preference screen, however not necessarily what you currently have.



(From Vadim in this blog post " Content Assist Duplicates in Eclipse (Mylyn)":
if have duplicate Mylyn entries, uncheck the duplicate entries that do not contain "(Mylyn)" in their name)

The Eclipse help page defines the default list to restore:


  Select the proposal kinds contained in the 'default' content assist list:
  
  
  Other Java Proposals, 
  SWT Template Proposals, 
  Template Proposals, 
  Type Proposals

Check the lib of your project. It may be that you have include two such jar files in which same class is available or say one class in code can be refrenced in two jar files. In such case also eclipse stops assisting code as it is totally confused.

Better way to check this is go to the file where assist is not working and comment all imports there, than add imports one by one and check at each import if code-assist is working or not.You can easily find the class with duplicate refrences.

I experience problems on Eclipse Neon when editing a file which does not belong to the project directory. When I copy the same file to the project root directory, not even to the src directory, the completion starts working.

Just in case anyone got to a desperate point where nothing works... It happened to us that the content assist somehow shrunk so no suggestion was shown, just the "Press Ctrl+Space for non-Java..." could be seen.

I have a project named XXX. I want to rename this project to YYY.

Note that XXX is an extremely common term (for e.g. "data", or simply "project"), and thus a simple RegEx search-and-replace is not possible, out of risk of corrupting the project configuration files.

My current project directory contains the following items:


XXX
XXXTests
XXX.xcodeproj


and I want to rename them to:


YYY
YYYTests
YYY.xcodeproj


... respectively, with the necessary changes being reflected in my project file. 

How can I accomplish this without having to manually create and populate a new project?



Edit: It is absolutely ridiculous that this has become my most upvoted question.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Step 1 - Rename the project

Click on the project you want to rename in the &quot;Project navigator&quot; in the left panel of the Xcode window.
In the right panel, select the &quot;File inspector&quot;, and the name of your project should be found under &quot;Identity and Type&quot;. Change it to your new name.
When the dialog asks whether to rename or not rename the
project's content items, click &quot;Rename&quot;. Say yes to any warning about uncommitted changes.

Step 2 - Rename the scheme

At the top of the window, next to the &quot;Stop&quot; button, there is a scheme for your product under its old name; click on it, then choose &quot;Manage Schemes…&quot;.
Click on the old name in the scheme and it will become editable; change the name and click &quot;Close&quot;.

Step 3 - Rename the folder with your assets

Quit Xcode. Rename the master folder that contains all your project files.
In the correctly-named master folder, beside your newly-named .xcodeproj file, there is probably a wrongly-named OLD folder containing your source files. Rename the OLD folder to your new name (if you use Git, you could run git mv oldname newname so that Git recognizes this is a move, rather than deleting/adding new files).
Re-open the project in Xcode. If you see a warning &quot;The folder OLD does not exist&quot;, dismiss the warning. The source files in the renamed folder will be grayed out because the path has broken.
In the &quot;Project navigator&quot; in the left-hand panel, click on the top-level folder representing the OLD folder you renamed.
In the right-hand panel, under &quot;Identity and Type&quot;, change the &quot;Name&quot; field from the OLD name to the new name.
Just below that field is a &quot;Location&quot; menu. If the full path has not corrected itself, click on the nearby folder icon and choose the renamed folder.

Step 4 - Rename the Build plist data

Click on the project in the &quot;Project navigator&quot; on the left, and in the main panel select &quot;Build Settings&quot;.
Search for &quot;plist&quot; in the settings.
In the Packaging section, you will see Info.plist and Product Bundle Identifier.
If there is a name entered in Info.plist, update it.
Do the same for Product Bundle Identifier, unless it is utilizing the ${PRODUCT_NAME} variable. In that case, search for &quot;product&quot; in the settings and update Product Name. If Product Name is based on ${TARGET_NAME}, click on the actual target item in the TARGETS list on the left of the settings pane and edit it, and all related settings will update immediately.
Search the settings for &quot;prefix&quot; and ensure that Prefix Header's path is also updated to the new name.
If you use SwiftUI, search for &quot;Development Assets&quot; and update the path.

Step 5 - Repeat step 3 for tests (if you have them)
Step 6 - Repeat step 3 for core data if its name matches project name (if you have it)
Step 7 - Clean and rebuild your project

Close XCode.
Go to your /NewProjectFolder.


cd /Path/to/your/NewProjectFolder



Install the extra tools needed.


brew install rename ack



Rename the files and directories containing the source string. You’ll need to RUN THIS COMMAND TWICE, because directories will be renamed first, then files and directories inside those will be renamed on the next iteration.


find . -name 'oldName*' -print0 | xargs -0 rename --subst-all 'oldName' 'NewProject'



Check if all the files containing the source string are renamed. You should see empty output.


find . -name 'oldName*'



Replace all occurrences of the string in all files.


ack --literal --files-with-matches 'oldName' --print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '' 's/oldName/NewProject/g'



Check if all occurrences of the string in all files were replaced. You should see empty output.


ack --literal 'oldName'

I just switched from Eclipse to IntelliJ.   IntelliJ lacks one feature from Eclipse - when you put your mouse over a method, Eclipse shows javadoc info. I think the way to show it is to use a shortcut - command+J, but when I click it, I get something wrong as on the screen shot below. Please advise me on how I can quickly get javadoc information. I need to at least know what type a method returns.


    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Use View | Quick Documentation or the corresponding keyboard shortcut (by default: Ctrl+Q on Windows/Linux and Ctrl+J on macOS or F1 in the recent IDE versions). See the documentation for more information.

It's also possible to enable automatic JavaDoc popup on explicit (invoked by a shortcut) code completion in Settings | Editor | General | Code completion (Autopopup documentation):



Yet another way to see the quick doc is on mouse move:

Alternatively you can position your cursor on the item and show JavaDoc using 


  CTRL+Q


which is the default shortcut.

Edit: As Methical mentioned on Mac the shortcut is


  CTRL+j (^+j not ⌘+j)

For me, it wasn't just getting the javadoc window to open, but also getting the complete javadoc to present.  You may still get a sparse javadoc that is based solely on the method signature if you are importing libraries from a Maven repository and do not tell Idea to include the javadocs in the download.  Be sure to tick the "JavaDocs" option in the "Download Library From Maven Repository" dialog, which can be found under Project Structure -

The closest to Eclipse will be Ctrl+Button2 Click (Scroll click)

It's called Quick Doc in IntelliJ, I wish guys from JetBrains one day add quick doc like Eclipse with Ctrl+Mouse Move it's so much better.

In my case only with only mouse move is a bit annoying, so if you search in Preferences/Settings --/strong/pulliem/emem/em/liliem/emem/em/li/ul/div

Title: PHPDoc type hinting for array of objects?
Description: 
    
    
                    
So, in PHPDoc one can specify @var above the member variable declaration to hint at its type. Then an IDE, for ex. PHPEd, will know what type of object it's working with and will be able to provide a code insight for that variable.

&lt;?php
  class Test
  {
    /** @var SomeObj */
    private $someObjInstance;
  }
?&gt;


This works great until I need to do the same to an array of objects to be able to get a proper hint when I iterate through those objects later on.

So, is there a way to declare a PHPDoc tag to specify that the member variable is an array of SomeObjs? @var array is not enough, and @var array(SomeObj) doesn't seem to be valid, for example.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Use:

/* @var $objs Test[] */
foreach ($objs as $obj) {
    // Typehinting will occur after typing $obj-&gt;
}


when typehinting inline variables, and

class A {
    /** @var Test[] */
    private $items;
}


for class properties.

Previous answer from '09 when PHPDoc (and IDEs like Zend Studio and Netbeans) didn't have that option:

The best you can do is say,

foreach ($Objs as $Obj)
{
    /* @var $Obj Test */
    // You should be able to get hinting after the preceding line if you type $Obj-&gt;
}


I do that a lot in Zend Studio. Don't know about other editors, but it ought to work.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
In the PhpStorm IDE from JetBrains, you can use /** @var SomeObj[] */, e.g.:
/**
 * @return SomeObj[]
 */
function getSomeObjects() {...}

The phpdoc documentation recommends this method:

specified containing a single type, the Type definition informs the reader of the type of each array element. Only one Type is then expected as element for a given array.
Example: @return int[]

    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Netbeans hints:

You get code completion on $users[0]-&gt; and for $this-&gt; for an array of User classes. 

/**
 * @var User[]
 */
var $users = array();


You also can see the type of the array in a list of class members when you do completion of $this-&gt;...
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
To specify a variable is an array of objects: 

$needles = getAllNeedles();
/* @var $needles Needle[] */
$needles[1]-&gt;...                        //codehinting works


This works in Netbeans 7.2 (I'm using it)

Works also with:

$needles = getAllNeedles();
/* @var $needles Needle[] */
foreach ($needles as $needle) {
    $needle-&gt;...                        //codehinting works
}


Therefore use of declaration inside the foreach is not necessary.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
PSR-5: PHPDoc proposes a form of Generics-style notation.

Syntax

Type[]
Type&lt;Type&gt;
Type&lt;Type[, Type]...&gt;
Type&lt;Type[|Type]...&gt;


Values in a Collection MAY even be another array and even another Collection.

Type&lt;Type&lt;Type&gt;&gt;
Type&lt;Type&lt;Type[, Type]...&gt;&gt;
Type&lt;Type&lt;Type[|Type]...&gt;&gt;


Examples

&lt;?php

$x = [new Name()];
/* @var $x Name[] */

$y = new Collection([new Name()]);
/* @var $y Collection&lt;Name&gt; */

$a = new Collection(); 
$a[] = new Model_User(); 
$a-&gt;resetChanges(); 
$a[0]-&gt;name = "George"; 
$a-&gt;echoChanges();
/* @var $a Collection&lt;Model_User&gt; */


Note: If you are expecting an IDE to do code assist then it's another question about if the IDE supports PHPDoc Generic-style collections notation.

From my answer to this question.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
I prefer to read and write clean code - as outlined in "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin.
When following his credo you should not require the developer (as user of your API) to know the (internal) structure of your array. 

The API user may ask: Is that an array with one dimension only? Are the objects spread around on all levels of a multi dimensional array? How many nested loops (foreach, etc.) do i need to access all objects? What type of objects are "stored" in that array?

As you outlined you want to use that array (which contains objects) as a one dimensional array. 

As outlined by Nishi you can use:

/**
 * @return SomeObj[]
 */


for that. 

But again: be aware - this is not a standard docblock notation. This notation was introduced by some IDE producers. 

Okay, okay, as a developer you know that "[]" is tied to an array in PHP. But what do a "something[]" mean in normal PHP context? "[]" means: create new element within "something". The new element could be everything. But what you want to express is: array of objects with the same type and it´s exact type. As you can see, the IDE producer introduces a new context. A new context you had to learn. A new context other PHP developers had to learn (to understand your docblocks). Bad style (!).

Because your array do have one dimension you maybe want to call that "array of objects" a "list". Be aware that "list" has a very special meaning in other programming languages. It would be mutch better to call it "collection" for example.

Remember: you use a programming language that enables you all options of OOP.
Use a class instead of an array and make your class traversable like an array. E.g.:

class orderCollection implements ArrayIterator


Or if you want to store the internal objects on different levels within an multi dimensional array/object structure:

class orderCollection implements RecursiveArrayIterator


This solution replaces your array by an object of type "orderCollection", but do not enable code completion within your IDE so far. Okay. Next step:

Implement the methods that are introduced by the interface with docblocks - particular: 

/**
 * [...]
 * @return Order
 */
orderCollection::current()

/**
 * [...]
 * @return integer E.g. database identifier of the order
 */
orderCollection::key()

/**
 * [...]
 * @return Order
 */
orderCollection::offsetGet()


Do not forget to use type hinting for:

orderCollection::append(Order $order)
orderCollection::offsetSet(Order $order)


This solution stops introducing a lot of:

/** @var $key ... */
/** @var $value ... */


all over your code files (e.g. within loops), as Zahymaka confirmed with her/his answer. Your API user is not forced to introduce that docblocks, to have code completion. To have @return on only one place reduces the redundancy (@var) as mutch as possible. Sprinkle "docBlocks with @var" would make your code worst readable.

Finaly you are done. Looks hard to achive? Looks like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Not realy, since you are familiar with that interfaces and with clean code. Remember: your source code is written once / read many.

If code completion of your IDE do not work with this approach, switch to a better one (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, Netbeans) or file a feature request on the issue tracker of your IDE producer.

In Zend Studio, array[MyClass] or array[int] or even array[array[MyClass]] work great.
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
In NetBeans 7.0 (may be lower too) you could declare  the the return type "array with Text objects " just as @return Text and the code hinting will work:

Edit: updated the example with @Bob Fanger suggestion

/**
 * get all Tests
 *
 * @return Test|Array $tests
 */
public function getAllTexts(){
    return array(new Test(), new Test());
}


and just use it:

$tests =  $controller-&gt;getAllTests();
//$tests-&gt;         //codehinting works!
//$tests[0]-&gt;      //codehinting works!

foreach($tests as $text){
    //$test-&gt;      //codehinting works!
}


It is not perfect but it is better then just to leave it just "mixed", which brings no value.

CONS is you are allowed to tread the array as Text Object which will throw errors.
    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
As DanielaWaranie mentioned in her answer - there is a way to specify the type of $item when you iterating over $items in $collectionObject: Add @return MyEntitiesClassName to current() and rest of the Iterator and ArrayAccess-methods which return values.

Boom! No need in /** @var SomeObj[] $collectionObj */ over foreach, and works right with collection object, no need to return collection with specific method described as @return SomeObj[].

I suspect not all IDE support it but it works perfectly fine in PhpStorm, which makes me happier.

Example:

class MyCollection implements Countable, Iterator, ArrayAccess {

    /**
     * @return User
     */
    public function current() {
        return $this-&gt;items[$this-&gt;cursor];
    }

    //... implement rest of the required `interface` methods and your custom
}


What useful i was going to add posting this answer

In my case current() and rest of interface-methods are implemented in Abstract-collection class and I do not know what kind of entities will eventually be stored in collection.

So here is the trick: Do not specify return type in abstract class, instead use PhpDoc instuction @method in description of specific collection class.

Example:

class User {

    function printLogin() {
        echo $this-&gt;login;
    }

}

abstract class MyCollection implements Countable, Iterator, ArrayAccess {

    protected $items = [];

    public function current() {
        return $this-&gt;items[$this-&gt;cursor];
    }

    //... implement rest of the required `interface` methods and your custom
    //... abstract methods which will be shared among child-classes
}

/**
 * @method User current()
 * ...rest of methods (for ArrayAccess) if needed
 */
class UserCollection extends MyCollection {

    function add(User $user) {
        $this-&gt;items[] = $user;
    }

    // User collection specific methods...

}


Now, usage of classes:

$collection = new UserCollection();
$collection-&gt;add(new User(1));
$collection-&gt;add(new User(2));
$collection-&gt;add(new User(3));

foreach ($collection as $user) {
    // IDE should `recognize` method `printLogin()` here!
    $user-&gt;printLogin();
}


Once again: I suspect not all IDE support it, but PhpStorm does. Try yours, post in comment the results!
    
    
Answer 10: 

    
    
I know I'm late to the party, but I've been working on this problem recently.  I hope someone sees this because the accepted answer, although correct, is not the best way you can do this.  Not in PHPStorm at least, I haven't tested NetBeans though.

The best way involves extending the ArrayIterator class rather than using native array types.  This allows you to type hint at a class-level rather than at an instance-level, meaning you only have to PHPDoc once, not throughout your code (which is not only messy and violates DRY, but can also be problematic when it comes to refactoring - PHPStorm has a habit of missing PHPDoc when refactoring)

See code below:

class MyObj
{
    private $val;
    public function __construct($val) { $this-&gt;val = $val; }
    public function getter() { return $this-&gt;val; }
}

/**
 * @method MyObj current()
 */
class MyObjCollection extends ArrayIterator
{
    public function __construct(Array $array = [])
    {
        foreach($array as $object)
        {
            if(!is_a($object, MyObj::class))
            {
                throw new Exception('Invalid object passed to ' . __METHOD__ . ', expected type ' . MyObj::class);
            }
        }
        parent::__construct($array);
    }

    public function echoContents()
    {
        foreach($this as $key =&gt; $myObj)
        {
            echo $key . ': ' . $myObj-&gt;getter() . '&lt;br&gt;';
        }
    }
}

$myObjCollection = new MyObjCollection([
    new MyObj(1),
    new MyObj('foo'),
    new MyObj('blah'),
    new MyObj(23),
    new MyObj(array())
]);

$myObjCollection-&gt;echoContents();


The key here is the PHPDoc @method MyObj current() overriding the return type  inherited from ArrayIterator (which is mixed).  The inclusion of this PHPDoc means that when we iterate over the class properties using foreach($this as $myObj), we then get code completion when referring to the variable $myObj-&gt;...

To me, this is the neatest way to achieve this (at least until PHP introduces Typed Arrays, if they ever do), as we're declaring the iterator type in the iterable class, not on instances of the class scattered throughout the code.

I haven't shown here the complete solution for extending ArrayIterator, so if you use this technique, you may also want to:


Include other class-level PHPDoc as required, for methods such as offsetGet($index) and next()
Move the sanity check is_a($object, MyObj::class) from the constructor into a private method
Call this (now private) sanity check from method overrides such as offsetSet($index, $newval) and append($value)

    
    
Answer 11: 

    
    
The problem is that @var can just denote a single type - Not contain a complex formula. If you had a syntax for "array of Foo", why stop there and not add a syntax for "array of array, that contains 2 Foo's and three Bar's"? I understand that a list of elements is perhaps more generic than that, but it's a slippery slope.

Personally, I have some times used @var Foo[] to signify "an array of Foo's", but it's not supported by IDE's.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I have a directory structure

├── simulate.py
├── src

And I can access the network module with sys.path.insert().

Answer 1: 

    
    
Manually adding it as you have done is indeed one way of doing this, but there is a simpler method, and that is by simply telling pycharm that you want to add the src folder as a source root, and then adding the sources root to your python path.

This way, you don't have to hard code things into your interpreter's settings:


Add src as a source content root:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



Then make sure to add add sources to your PYTHONPATH:





Now imports will be resolved:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


This way, you can add whatever you want as a source root, and things will simply work. If you unmarked it as a source root however, you will get an error:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

My folder hierarcy is slightly different from the one in the question. Mine is like this

├── MyDirectory

Although all the answers are really helpful, there's one tiny piece of information that should be explained explicitly:


Essentially, a project with multiple hierarchical directories work as a package with some attributes.
To import custom local created Classes, we need to navigate to the directory containing .py file and create an __init__.py (empty) file there.


Why this helps is because this file is required to make Python treat the directory as containing packages. Cheers!

So I removed venv; from the list of directories to ignore and VOILA!!  I was FINALLY able to fix this problem.  Literally all of my import problems were fixed for the project.
BTW, I had installed each and every package using PyCharm, and not through a terminal. (Meaning, by going to Settings&gt;Interpreter...). I had invalidated cache, changed 'Source Root', restarted PyCharm, refreshed my interpreters paths, changed interpreters, deleted my venv...  I tried everything.  This finally worked. Obviously there are multiple problems going on here with different people, so this may not work for you, but it's definitely worth a shot if nothing else has worked, and easy to reverse if it doesn't.

The "Mark as Excluded" option isn't there anymore.

The current (Android Studio 0.8.x - 2.2.x) way to do this is via the Project Structure dialog. It can be accessed via "File -/ppimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/piX7s.png" alt="enter image description here"/pp/ppimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cUfVZ.png" alt="enter image description here"/pp/pp/p/div

Delete module's name from the include statement
Sync Project with Gradle Files
Optionally, delete it manually from the project folder

In Android studio v1.0.2

Method 1

Go to project structure, File -&gt; Project Structure..., as the following picture show, click - icon to remove the module.

Method 2

Edit the file settings.gradle and remove the entry you are going to delete. e.g. edit the file from include ':app', ':apple' to include ':app'.

That will work in most of the situation, however finally you have to delete the module from disk manually if you don't need it anymore.

The most reliable way I have found to do this it to go to project structure and remove it from dependencies and remove it from your setting.gradle file.

It will appear as if it is fully deleted at his point but it is not. If you try to re add the module it will say that it already exist in the project.

You can delete an Android Studio module as follows:


In the Project Tool Window click the module you want to delete.

Answer 1: 

    
    
CTRL-click works anywhere

CTRL-click that brings you to where clicked object is defined works everywhere - not only in Java classes and variables in Java code, but in Spring configuration (you can click on class name, or property, or bean name), in Hibernate (you can click on property name or class, or included resource), you can navigate within one click from Java class to where it is used as Spring or Hibernate bean; clicking on included JSP or JSTL tag also works, ctrl-click on JavaScript variable or function brings you to the place it is defined or shows a menu if there are more than one place, including other .js files and JS code in HTML or JSP files.

Autocomplete for many languagues

Hibernate

Autocomplete in HSQL expressions, in Hibernate configuration (including class, property and DB column names), in Spring configuration

&lt;property name="propName" ref="&lt;hit CTRL-SPACE&gt;"


and it will show you list of those beans which you can inject into that property. 

Java

Very smart autocomplete in Java code:

interface Person {
    String getName();
    String getAddress();
    int getAge();
}
//---
Person p;
String name = p.&lt;CTRL-SHIFT-SPACE&gt;


and it shows you ONLY getName(), getAddress() and toString() (only they are compatible by type) and getName() is first in the list because it has more relevant name. Latest version 8 which is still in EAP has even more smart autocomplete.

interface Country{
}
interface Address {
    String getStreetAddress();
    String getZipCode();
    Country getCountry();
}
interface Person {
    String getName();
    Address getAddress();
    int getAge();
}
//--- 
Person p;
Country c = p.&lt;CTRL-SHIFT-SPACE&gt;


and it will silently autocomplete it to

Country c = p.getAddress().getCountry();


Javascript

Smart autocomplete in JavaScript.

function Person(name,address) {
    this.getName = function() { return name };
    this.getAddress = function() { return address };
}

Person.prototype.hello = function() {
    return "I'm " + this.getName() + " from " + this.get&lt;CTRL-SPACE&gt;;
}


and it shows ONLY getName() and getAddress(), no matter how may get* methods you have in other JS objects in your project, and ctrl-click on this.getName() brings you to where this one is defined, even if there are some other getName() functions in your project.

HTML

Did I mention autocomplete and ctrl-clicking in paths to files, like &lt;script src="", &lt;img src="", etc?

Autocomplete in HTML tag attributes. Autocomplete in style attribute of HTML tags, both attribute names and values. Autocomplete in class attributes as well.
Type &lt;div class="&lt;CTRL-SPACE/ph3/h3p/pprecode/code/preh2/h2p/ph2/h2pem/emem/em/ph2/h2p/pp/ppem/emem/emem/emem/emem/em/ppcode/code/ph2/h2p/ppcode/code/pp/p/div

There is only one reason I use intellij and not eclipse: Usability 

Whether it is debugging, refactoring, auto-completion.. Intellij is much easier to use with consistent key bindings, options available where you look for them etc. Feature-wise, it will be tough for intellij to catch up with Eclipse, as the latter has much more plugins available that intellij, and is easily extensible.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Probably is not a matter of what can/can't be done, but how.

For instance both have editor surrounded with dock panels for project, classpath, output, structure etc. But in Idea when I start to type all these collapse automatically let me focus on the code it self; In eclipse all these panels keep open leaving my editor area  very reduced,  about 1/5 of the total viewable area. So I have to grab the mouse and click to  minimize in those panels. Doing this all day long is a very frustrating experience in eclipse.

The exact opposite thing happens with the view output window.  In Idea running a program brings the output window/panel  to see the output of the program even if it was perviously minimized.  In eclipse I have to grab my mouse again and look for the output tab and click it to view my program output, because the output window/panel is just another one, like all the rest of the windows, but in Idea it is treated in a special way: "If the user want to run his program, is very likely he wants to see the output of that program!"  It seems so natural when I write it, but eclipse fails in this basic user interface concept.

Probably there's a shortcut for this in eclipse ( autohide output window while editing and autoshow it when running the program ) , but as some other tens of features the shortcut must be hunted in forums, online help etc while in Idea is a little bit more "natural". 

This can be repeated for almost all the features both have, autocomplete, word wrap, quick documentation view, everything. I think the user experience is far more pleasant in Idea than in eclipse. Then the motto comes true "Develop with pleasure"

Eclipse handles faster larger projects ( +300 jars and +4000 classes )  and I think IntelliJ Idea 8 is working on this.

All this of course is subjective. How can we measure user experience? 
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Idea 8.0 has the lovely ctrl+shift+space x 2 that does the following autocomplete:

 City city = customer.&lt;ctrl-shift-space twice&gt;


resolves to 

 City city = customer.getAddress().getCity();


through any number of levels of getters/setters.

My favorite shortcut in IntelliJ that has no equivalent in Eclipse (that I've found) is called 'Go to symbol'.  CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-N lets you start typing and glob up classes, method names, variable names, etc, from the entire project.

I tried to switch to IntelliJ because of the new Android Studio. But I'm very disappointed now. I'm using Eclipse with the Code Recommanders Plugin. Here is a simple example why Eclipse is so awesome:

I want to create a new SimpleTimeZone. SimpleTimeZone has no Constructor with zero arguments.

Ctrl + Space in Eclipse



Ctrl + Space in IntelliJ



In IntelliJ I get no informations what kind of constructors SimpleTimeZone has.

After Enter in Eclipse



I get the previously selected constructor filled with predefined variable names. And I can see the type of every argument. With Code Recommanders Eclipse guesses the right constructor by the previously defined variable types in the current scope and fills the constructor with these vars.

After Enter in IntelliJ nothing happens. I get an empty constructor. I have to press Ctrl + P to see the expected arguments.


    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
If you have the cursor on a method then CTRL+SHIFT+I will popup the method implementation. If the method is an interface method, then you can use up- and down- arrows to cycle through the implementations:

Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; m = ...
m.contains|Key("Wibble");


Where | is (for example) where your cursor is.

One thing I use regularly is setting a breakpoint, but then controlling what it does. (At my last job, most everyone else used Eclipse... I remember being surprised that no one could find how to do this in Eclipse.)

For example, can have the breakpoint not actually stop, but just log a message to the console. Which means, I don't have to litter my code with "System.out.println(...)" and then recompile.
    
    
Answer 12: 

    
    
There are many things that idea solves in a much simpler way, or there's no equivalent:


Autocomplete actions: Doing ctrl+shift+a you can call any idea action from the keyboard without remembering its key combination... Think about gnome-do or launchy in windows, and you've got the idea! Also, this feature supports CamelCasing abbreviations ;)
Shelf: Lets you keep easily some pieces of code apart, and then review them through the diff viewer.
Local history: It's far better managed, and simpler.
SVN annotations and history: simpler to inspect, and also you can easily see the history only for such a part of a whole source file.
Autocomplete everywhere, such as the evaluate expression and breakpoint condition windows.
Maven integration... much, much simpler, and well integrated.
Refactors much closer to the hand, such as loops insertion, wrapping/casting, renaming, and add variables.
Find much powerful and well organized. Even in big projects
Much stable to work with several branches of a big project at the same time (as a former bugfixer of 1.5Gb by branch sources, and the need to working in them simultaneously, idea shown its rock-solid capabilities)
Cleaner and simpler interface...
And, simpler to use only with the keyboard, letting apart the need of using the mouse for lots of simple taks, saving you time and giving you more focus on the code... where it matters!


And now, being opensource... the Idea user base will grow exponentially.

Structural search and replace.

For example, search for something like:

  System.out.println($string$ + $expr$);


Where $string$ is a literal, and $expr$ is an expression of type my.package.and.Class, and then replace with:

  $expr$.inspect($string$);

My timing may be a little off in terms of this thread, but I just had to respond.

I am a huge eclipse fan -- using it since it's first appearance. A friend told me then (10+ years ago) that it would be a player. He was right.

However! I have just started using IntelliJ and if you haven't seen or used changelists -- you are missing out on programming heaven.

The ability to track my changed files (on my development branch ala clearcase) was something I was looking for in a plugin for eclipse. Intellij tracks all of your changes for a single commit, extremely easy. You can isolate changed files with custom lists. I use that for configuration files that must be unique locally, but are constantly flagged when I sync or compare against the repository -- listing them under a changelist, I can monitor them, but neatly tuck them away so I can focus on the real additions I am making.

Also, there's a Commit Log plugin that outputs a text of all changes for those SCCS that aren't integrated with your bug tracking software. Pasting the log into a ticket's work history captures the files, their version, date/time, and the branch/tags. It's cool as hell.

All of this could be supported via plugins (or future enhancements) in eclipse, I wager; yet, Intellij makes this a breeze. 

Finally, I am really excited about the mainstream love for this product -- the keystrokes, so it's painful, but fun.

Well, for me it's a thousand tiny things. Some of the macros, the GUI layout in general in Eclipse I find awful. I can't open multiple projects in different windows in Eclipse. I can open multiple projects, but then it's view based system swaps a bunch of things around on me when I switch files. IntelliJ's code inspections seem better. Its popup helpers to fix common issues is nice. Lots of simple usability things like the side bar where I can hover over a hot spot and it'll tell me every implementing subclass of a method or the method I'm implementing and from where. 

Whenever I've had to use, or watch someone use, Eclipse it seems like they can do most of the things I can do in IntelliJ, but it takes them longer and it's clunkier.

Introduce variable. (Ctrl+Alt+V on Windows, Cmd+Alt+V on OSX)

Lets say you call a method, service.listAllPersons()
Hit Ctrl+Alt+V and Enter, and variable for return value from method call is inserted:

List&lt;Person&gt; list = service.listAllPersons();


Saves you typing, and you don't have to check the return type of the method you are calling. Especially useful when using generics, e.g.

new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;()


[introduce variable]

Intellij has a far superior SVN plug-in than either Subversive or Subclipse and it works! The amount of time we've wasted merging source files using Eclipse doesn't bear thinking about. This isn't an issue with IntelliJ because the plugin helps you much more. 

Also the Subclipse plugin is unreliable - we regularly have instances where the plugin doesn't think there has been any code checked in to SVN by other developers, but there has - the CI server has processed them!

One very useful feature is the ability to partially build a Maven reactor project so that only the parts you need are included. 

To make this a little clearer, consider the case of a collection of WAR files with a lot of common resources (e.g. JavaScript, Spring config files etc) being shared between them using the overlay technique. If you are working on some web page (running in Jetty) and want to change some of the overlay code that is held in a separate module then you'd normally expect to have to stop Jetty, run the Maven build, start Jetty again and continue. This is the case with Eclipse and just about every other IDE I've worked with. Not so in IntelliJ. Using the project settings you can define which facet of which module you would like to be included in a background build. Consequently you end up with a process that appears seamless. You make a change to pretty much any code in the project and instantly it is available after you refresh the browser.

Very neat, and very fast.

Preamble to my answer: My use of Eclipse is limited. We needed a Java IDE to work on both Windows and Mac and the Mac port slowed down day by day. This was years ago and I'm sure it's OK now. But that is what got us to switch to IntelliJ and we've been happy with it.

Now for my answer: One big difference I haven't seen mentioned yet is that tech support is better with IntelliJ/Jet Brains. We send an e-mail to JetBrains and get a definitive answer back in less than an hour. Looking for answers to Eclipse problems results in the usual, "You stupid idiot" answers (usually a small number of the replies) along with the much larger number of insightful, helpful replies. But it takes some sorting through to get the real answer.

Something which I use in IntelliJ all the time is refactoring as I type.  I have re-written classes from a printout (originally written in eclipse) using both IDEs and I used about 40% less key strokes/mouse clicks to write the same classes in IntelliJ than eclipse.

I wouldn't want to use Eclipse until they support as much refactoring with incomplete pieces of code.

Answer 28: 

    
    
There is one thing that IntelliJ does much much better than Eclipse and that is empty your pockets! 

I do however prefer using it and one big advantage it has over Eclipce is the way it synchronises with the file system, for big projects and slow computers (yes in work environments the PC's are a lot slower than our ones at home) Eclipse seems to struggle where IntelliJ seems to be quicker albeit with a slower initial indexing time.

IntelliJ Community edition obviously makes using it free but you soon want those extra refactoring and nice little goodies not included in the CC edition.

In my opinion, its generally a better user experience but whether its worth the cost is a question for each developer to answer themselves. 

But lets be grateful we have up to three great IDEs for Java right now with NetBeans getting better all the time.

First of all I love intellij.  There are at least a hundred features it has that eclipse lack.  I'm talking magnitudes better in reliability and intelligence that no hyperbole can describe when it comes to refactoring, renaming, moving and others which have already been mentioned.

BUT, there is one thing that intellij does not allow which eclipse does.  It does not allow running multiple projects at once under the same vm.  

When you have separate projects for the front, middle, core, agents..etc, where they all have to interact with each other, you can not quickly modify and debug at the same time, afaik. The only way I current cope with this is to use ant scripts to deploy and update jars in dependent projects, or use maven. 

Eclipse allows multiple projects to be debugged under one ide vm instance. 
    
    
Title: How do I enable the column selection mode in Eclipse?
Description: 
    
    
                    
News wrote that Eclipse 3.5 finally supports column selection. 
Unfortunately I don't know HOW to enable it. I tried pressing the ALT-key like I am used to in Visual Studio and all other Microsoft products but that had no effect. 

How can I mark a vertical block in Eclipse? 
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
To activate the cursor and select the columns you want to select use: 


  Windows:
  Alt+Shift+A
  
  Mac: command + option + A
  
  Linux-based OS:
  Alt+Shift+A


To deactivate, press the keys again.

This information was taken from DJ's Java Blog.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
On Windows and Linux, it's AltShiftA, as RichieHindle pointed out.  On OSX it's OptionCommandA (⌘⌥A).  It's also worth noting that the two modes can have different font preferences, so if you've changed the default text font, it can be jarring to toggle block selection modes and see the font change.

Finally, the "search commands" (Ctrl3 or Command3) pop-up will find it for you if you type block.  This is useful if you use the feature just frequently enough to forget the hotkey.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
As RichieHindle pointed out the shortcut for column (block) selection is Alt+Shift+A. The problem I ran into is that the Android SDK on Eclipse uses 3 shortcuts that all start with Alt+Shift+A, so if you type that, you'll be given a choice of continuing with D, S, or R.

To solve this I redefined the column selection as Alt+Shift+A,A (Alt, Shift, A pressed together and then followed by a subsequent A). To do this go to Windows &gt; Preferences then type keys or navigate to General &gt; Keys. Under the Keys enter the filter text of block selection to quickly find the shortcut listing for toggle block selection. Here you can adjust the shortcut for column selection as you wish.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
First of all your mouse key must be focus in editor to enable Toggle Block Selection Mode



Click on toggleButton as shown in figure and it will enable Vertical selection. After selection toggle it again.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Additionally, you can change the keys view window -/p/div
Answer 6: 

    
    
You can enable and disable column editing mode via the keyboard shortcut ALT-SHIFT-A.  

Once enabled you can then use either the mouse to select a block of text, or the keyboard using SHIFT (like a normal keyboard select, except the selection will now be in a block).  

If you've changed your default font for text editing, entering column editing mode will probably change your screen font to the default column editing font (which is probably different to your changed font.  To change the font when in column editing mode, go to the menu and select Window -&gt; Preferences, then in the tree on the left hand side, pick General -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Colors and Fonts, and then pick Basic -&gt; Text Editor Block Selection Font on the right hand side tree.  You can then select the font to be consistent with your "not in column editing mode" font.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
A different approach:

The vrapper plugin emulates vim inside the Eclipse editor. One of its features is visual block mode which works fine inside Eclipse.

It is by default mapped to Ctrl-V which interferes with the paste command in Eclipse. You can either remap the visual block mode to a different shortcut, or remap the paste command to a different key. I chose the latter: remapped the paste command to Ctrl-Shift-V to match my terminal's behavior. 
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    

Press Alt + Shift + A
Observe that the screen zooms out
Make selection using the mouse
Press Alt + Shift + A to go back to the old mode.

Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm trying to use Android Studio, and the first time I boot it up, it takes like 45 MINUTES to compile... If I don't quit the application, it is okay - each subsequent compilation/running the app will take around 45 seconds.

I've tried to check some of my caches: there's a .gradle/caches folder in my home directory, and it's contains 123 MB.

There's also a .gradle folder in my project folder... one of the taskArtifacts was like 200 MB. I'm scared to just randomly nuke them both. What parts of the folders are safe to delete?

Is there a better explanation for why my Android Studio is taking forever to run the gradle assemble task upon first time loading the application?

Do I also have to clear the intellij cache too?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
As @Bradford20000 pointed out in the comments, there might be a gradle.properties file as well as global gradle scripts located under $HOME/.gradle. In such case special attention must be paid when deleting the content of this directory.

The .gradle/caches directory holds the Gradle build cache. So if you have any error about build cache, you can delete it.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Gradle cache locates at 


On Windows: %USER_HOME%\.gradle/caches/
On Mac/Unix: ~/.gradle/caches/


You can browse to these directory and manually delete it or run 

rm -rf $HOME/.gradle/caches/


on Unix system. Run this command will also force to download dependencies.

Update 2: Clear the Android build cache of current project 

Note: Android Studio's File | Invalidate Caches/Restart doesn't clear the Android build cache, so you'll have to clean it separately.

On Windows:

gradlew cleanBuildCache


On Mac or Linux:

Build cache:

stores certain outputs that the Android plugin generates when building your project (such as unpackaged AARs and pre-dexed remote dependencies). Your clean builds are much faster while using the cache because the build system can simply reuse those cached files during subsequent builds, instead of recreating them. Projects using Android plugin 2.3.0 and higher use the build cache by default. To learn more, read Improve Build Speed with Build Cache.

Note: The cleanBuildCache task is not available if you disable the build cache.

Take care with gradle daemon, you have to stop it before clear and re-run gradle.

Answer 5: 

    
    
The gradle daemon also creates a many large text files of every single build log. They are stored here:


  ~/.gradle/daemon/X.X/daemon-XXXX.out.log


"X.X" is the gradle version in use, like "4.4", and "XXXX" are just random numbers, like "1234".

The total size can grow to several hundred MB in just a few months. There is no way to disable the logging, and the files are not automatically deleted and they do not really need to be retained.

But you can create a small gradle task to automatically delete them, and free up lots of disk space:

Add this to your app/build.gradle:

android {

    buildTypes {
        ...
    }

    // Delete large build log files from ~/.gradle/daemon/X.X/daemon-XXX.out.log
    // Source: https://discuss.gradle.org/t/gradle-daemon-produces-a-lot-of-logs/9905
    def gradle = project.getGradle()
    new File("${gradle.getGradleUserHomeDir().getAbsolutePath()}/daemon/${gradle.getGradleVersion()}").listFiles().each {
        if (it.getName().endsWith('.out.log')) {
            // println("Deleting gradle log file: $it") // Optional debug output
            it.delete()

there seems to be incorrect info posted here. some people report on how to clear the Android builder cache (with task cleanBuildCache) but do not seem to realize that said cache is independent of Gradle's build cache, AFAIK.

my understanding is that Android's cache predates (and inspired) Gradle's, but i could be wrong. whether the Android builder will be/was updated to use Gradle's cache and retire its own, i do not know.

EDIT: the Android builder cache is obsolete and has been eliminated. the Android Gradle plugin now uses Gradle's build cache instead. to control this cache you must now interact with Gradle's generic cache infrastructure.

TIP: search for Gradle's cache help online without mentioning the keyword 'android' to get help for the currently relevant cache.

EDIT 2: due to tir38's question in a comment below, i am testing using an Android Gradle plugin v3.4.2 project. the gradle cache is enabled by org.gradle.caching=true in gradle.properties. i do a couple of clean build and the second time most tasks show FROM-CACHE as their status, showing that the cache is working.

surprisingly, i have a cleanBuildCache gradle task and a &lt;user-home&gt;/.android/build-cache/3.4.2/ directory, both hinting the existence of an Android builder cache.

i execute cleanBuildCache and the 3.4.2/ directory is gone. next i do another clean build:


nothing changed: most tasks show FROM-CACHE as their status and the build completed at cache-enabled speeds.
the 3.4.2/ directory is recreated.
the 3.4.2/ directory is empty (save for 2 hidden, zero length marker files).


conclusions:


caching of all normal Android builder tasks is handled by Gradle.
executing cleanBuildCache does not clear or affect the build cache in any way.
there is still an Android builder cache there. this could be vestigial code that the Android build team forgot to remove, or it could actually cache something strange that for whatever reason has not or cannot be ported to using the Gradle cache. (the 'cannot' option being highly improvable, IMHO.)


next, i disable the Gradle cache by removing org.gradle.caching=true from gradle.properties and i try a couple of clean build:


the builds are slow.
all tasks show their status as being executed and not cached or up to date.
the 3.4.2/ directory continues to be empty.


more conclusions:


there is no Android builder cache fallback for when the Gradle cache fails to hit.
the Android builder cache, at least for common tasks, has indeed been eliminated as i stated before.
the relevant android doc contains outdated info. in particular the cache is not enabled by default as stated there, and the Gradle cache has to be enabled manually.


EDIT 3: user tir38 confirmed that the Android builder cache is obsolete and has been eliminated with this find. tir38 also created this issue. thanks!

Title: Adding a guideline to the editor in Visual Studio
Description: 
    
    
                    
Introduction

I've always been searching for a way to make Visual Studio draw a line after a certain amount of characters.

Below is a guide to enable these so called guidelines for various versions of Visual Studio.

Visual Studio 2013

Install Paul Harrington's Editor Guidelines extension for VS 2013

Visual Studio 2010 and 2012


Install Paul Harrington's Editor Guidelines extension for VS 2010 or VS 2012.
Open the registry at:
VS 2010: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\Text Editor
VS 2012: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\11.0\Text Editor
and add a new string called Guides with the value RGB(100,100,100), 80. The 
first part specifies the color, while the other one (80) is the column the line will be displayed.
Or install the Guidelines UI extension (which is also a part of the Productivity Power Tools), which will add entries to the editor's context menu for adding/removing the entries without needing to edit the registry directly. The current disadvantage of this method is that you can't specify the column directly.


Visual Studio 2008 and Other Versions

If you are using Visual Studio 2008 open the registry at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Text Editor and add a new string called Guides with the value RGB(100,100,100), 80. The first part specifies the color, while the other one (80) is the column the line will be displayed. The vertical line will appear, when you restart Visual Studio.

This trick also works for various other version of Visual Studio, as long as you use the correct path:

2003: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\7.1\Text Editor
2005: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\Text Editor
2008: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Text Editor
2008 Express: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VCExpress\9.0\Text Editor


This also works in SQL Server 2005 and probably other versions.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This is originally from Sara's blog.

It also works with almost any version of Visual Studio, you just need to change the "8.0" in the registry key to the appropriate version number for your version of Visual Studio.

The guide line shows up in the Output window too. (Visual Studio 2010 corrects this, and the line only shows up in the code editor window.)

You can also have the guide in multiple columns by listing more than one number after the color specifier:

RGB(230,230,230), 4, 80


Puts a white line at column 4 and column 80. This should be the value of a string value Guides in "Text Editor" key (see bellow).

Be sure to pick a line color that will be visisble on your background. This color won't show up on the default background color in VS. This is the value for a light grey: RGB(221, 221, 221).

Here are the registry keys that I know of:

Visual Studio 2010: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\Text Editor

Visual Studio 2008: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\Text Editor

Visual Studio 2005: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\Text Editor

Visual Studio 2003: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\7.1\Text Editor

For those running Visual Studio 2010, you may want to install the following extensions rather than changing the registry yourself:


http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/0fbf2878-e678-4577-9fdb-9030389b338c
http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7f2a6727-2993-4c1d-8f58-ae24df14ea91


These are also part of the Productivity Power Tools, which includes many other very useful extensions.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Without the need to edit any registry keys, the Productivity Power Tools extension (available for all versions of visual studio) provides guideline functionality.

Once installed just right click while in the editor window and choose the add guide line option. Note that the guideline will always be placed on the column where your editing cursor is currently at, regardless of where you right click in the editor window.



To turn off go to options and find Productivity Power Tools and in that section turn off Column Guides. A reboot will be necessary.

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\Text Editor


Also, Paul wrote an extension that adds entries to the editor's context menu for adding/removing the entries without needing to edit the registry directly.  You can find it here: http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7f2a6727-2993-4c1d-8f58-ae24df14ea91

EDIT: many moon after this question was asked, yes, now apparently you can.

No, but it's based on Intellij IDEA.

The community version of that is free for download but it doesn't support most things requiring an external database or application server. The line for Java is pretty much that JavaSE code can happily use Community.

If you want that (or are using JavaEE) then you either need the Ultimate version, which isn't free, or the EAP of the next version which is usually good for a month until they release another.

Basically it works like this

Android Studio is just Android the Android Stuff from IDEA 13 Community... 

...which will be free, and is anything from IDEA 13 Ultimate... 

...that doesn't require a database or app server.

http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

IDEA 12 Community doesn't have the ability to import the gradilized project and it won't, so while you can do Android development in it now (I do), don't expect it to have the same features as Android Studio. There's a lot of good new Android stuff in it, that's going into 13.

I found a somewhat hacky, annoying and not-completely-sure-it-always-works solution to this. I wanted to share in case someone else finds it useful.

In Android Studio, you can right-click a class with a main method and select "Run .main()". This will create a new Run configuration for YourClass, although it won't quite work: it will be missing some classpath entries.

In order to fix the missing classpath entries, go into the Project Structure and manually add the output folder location for your module and any other module dependencies that you need, like so:

I instead opened both android studio and intellij at same time and placed one screen next to the other and simply drag and dropped my java files, xml layouts, drawables, and manifest into the project hiearchy of a new project started in IntelliJ.

Spent a day on finding the easiest way to do this. The purpose was to find the fastest way to achieve this goal. I couldn't make it as fast as running javac command from terminal or compiling from netbeans or sublime text 3. But still got a good speed with android studio. 

This looks ruff and tuff way but since we don't initiate projects on daily bases that is why I am okay to do this.

I downloaded IntelliJ IDEA community version and created a simply java project. I added a main class and tested a run. Then simply closed IntelliJ IDEA and opened Android Studio and opened the same project there. Then I had to simply attach JDK where IDE helped me by showing a list of available JDKs and I selected 1.8 and then it compiled well. I can now open any main file and press Control+Shift+R to run that main file.

Then I copied all my Java files into src folder by Mac OS Finder. And I am able to compile anything I want to. 

There is nothing related to Gradle or Android and compile speed is pretty good.

To run a java file in Android ensure your class has the main method. In Android Studio 3.5 just right click inside the file and select "Run 'Filename.main()'" or click on "Run" on the menu and select "Run Filename" from the resulting drop-down menu.

I know that Ctrl + N is to find classes and it is very useful. But what about methods?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Windows : ctrl + F12

MacOS : cmd + F12

Above commands will show the functions/methods in the current class. 

Press SHIFT TWO times if you want to search both class and method in the whole project.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
ctrl + F12 (cmd + F12 on macOS) will show all members of the current class in a popup window and let you pick up one. It works exactly like the ctrl + o shortcut in eclipse, much faster than ctrl + alt + shift + n
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Ctrl + Alt + Shift + N allows you to search for symbols, including methods.

The primary advantage of this more complicated keybinding is that is searches in all files, not just the current file as Ctrl + F12 does.

(And as always, for Mac you substitute Cmd for Ctrl for these keybindings.)

If you just want to look for methods:

On mac OS X 10.5+ binding, it is Alt + ⌘ + O

By Default XWin Key binding, it is Shift + Ctrl + Alt + N

You can also press double SHIFT then, you can search anything (not only method, but also class, files, and actions)
    
    
Answer 10: 

    
    
It is worth adding that if you want to search for a method of a class, you can use a . (dot) between the class and method name inside of either the search everywhere or search symbols dialog. This even works with IDEAs usual search benefits. For example, you can search for LDT.now and LocalDateTime::now will pop up as a result. (As long as you are searching All Files and not just Project Files).

Invalidate Caches and Restart did not work for me. I also updated all my Android Studio files with no success. 

The solution I found was importing the android folder by clicking "Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)" rather than clicking "Open an existing Android Studio Project" or dragging the folder onto the app icon.

Apparently the problem is caused because a module in the project has an *.iml file that does not contain external.system.id="GRADLE".

When you import the project (as opposed to opening it), the iml files are completely re-written, thus removing the error.

You may resolve by below process:


In Android Studio, go to left panel, switch from Android to Project pane

In the modules.xml file, you might see like below: 


  &lt;component name="..."&gt;
    &lt;modules&gt;
      &lt;module fileurl="file://$PROJECT_DIR$/[check...].iml" filepath="$PROJECT_DIR$/[check...].iml" group="myProject" /&gt;
      &lt;module fileurl="file://$PROJECT_DIR$/app/[check...]-app.iml" filepath="$PROJECT_DIR$/app/[check...]-app.iml" group="[check...]/app" /&gt;

And then, sync the gradle file

    
    
Answer 12: 

    
    
Close the Android Studio and Move ".idea" Folder and paste it outside Project root folder( For Back up if you need).

On Opening the project it"ll ask add module (app) to your project. You can ignore the same.

It set set default build variant to be "debug".
You can see build variant tab on left corner or hover on "Monitor" Symbol on left bottom

To RUN press CtrlB (answer by matiit)
But when CtrlB does not work, Sublime Text probably can't find the Python Interpreter. When trying to run your program, see the log and find the reference to Python in path.
[cmd:  [u'python', u'-u', u'C:\\scripts\\test.py']]
[path: ...;C:\Python27 32bit;...]

The point is that it tries to run python via command line, the cmd looks like:
python -u C:\scripts\test.py

If you can't run python from cmd, Sublime Text can't too.
(Try it yourself in cmd, type python in it and run it, python commandline should appear)
SOLUTION
You can either change the Sublime Text build formula or the System %PATH%.

To set your %PATH%:
*You will need to restart your editor to load new %PATH%

Run Command Line* and enter this command: *needs to be run as administrator
SETX /M PATH &quot;%PATH%;&lt;python_folder&gt;&quot;
for example: SETX /M PATH &quot;%PATH%;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts&quot;

OR manually: (preferable)
Add ;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts at the end of the string.




To set the interpreter's path without messing with System %PATH% see this answer by ppy.

One thing to note about the aforementioned build system: you can write (and use) custom .sublime-build files or even per project build_systems clause (in your project settings). This allows you to do useful things like a fancy test runner with ANSI colors output.

For even more "full IDE" features, you can use the excellent SublimePythonIDE package:


code completion (intel)
jump to definition &amp; object description
proper linting/pep8

Use a real python console alongside Sublime

Both Sublime's build system and SublimeREPL (the answers above) are limited in that you can't easily interact with the workspace variables after you run your file. 

If you want to run a script, then work in a REPL-like fashion (like you would in an IDE), then I recommend having Sublime open alongside an IPython console. Using AutoHotKey (Windows) or AutoKey (Linux), you can set this up such that a single shortcut will copy the filename (or just the selected code) and then paste this in the console to run the file.

In Notepad++ I have set "replace tab with 2 spaces".

When coding in Python I copy-pasted some code from the web and it appeared indented correctly. But running the code resulted in indentation errors, which I solved in the end by removing all "visible" spaces at line beginnings and inserting the same amount of spaces again.

Yes, it does. The way to enable this depends on your version of Notepad++. On newer versions you can use:

Menu View → Show Symbol → Show White Space and TAB

(Thanks to bers' comment and bkaid's answers below for these updated locations.)

Double check your text with the Hex Editor Plug-in. In your case there may have been some control characters which have crept into your text. Usually you'll look at the white-space, and it will say 32 32 32 32, or for Unicode 32 00 32 00 32 00 32 00. You may find the problem this way, providing there isn't masses of code.

Answer 4: 

    
    
For non-printing characters, you can do the following:


if you could identify the character, where cursor takes 2 arrow keys
to move, just select that character.  
do Ctrl-F  
now you can count or
replace or even mark all such characters

    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Yes, and unfortunately you cannot turn them off, or any other special characters. The options under \View\Show Symbols only turns on or off things like tabs, spaces, EOL, etc.  So if you want to read some obscure coding with text in it - you actually need to look elsewhere.  I also looked at changing the coding, ASCII is not listed, and that would not make the mess invisible anyway.
    
    
Title: Autocompletion in Vim
Description: 
    
    
                    
In a nutshell, I'm searching for a working autocompletion feature for the Vim editor. I've argued before that Vim completely replaces an IDE under Linux and while that's certainly true, it lacks one important feature: autocompletion.

I know about Ctrl+N, Exuberant Ctags integration, Taglist, cppcomplete and OmniCppComplete. Alas, none of these fits my description of “working autocompletion:”


Ctrl+N works nicely (only) if you've forgotton how to spell class, or while. Oh well.
Ctags gives you the rudiments but has a lot of drawbacks.
Taglist is just a Ctags wrapper and as such, inherits most of its drawbacks (although it works well for listing declarations).
cppcomplete simply doesn't work as promised, and I can't figure out what I did wrong, or if it's “working” correctly and the limitations are by design.
OmniCppComplete seems to have the same problems as cppcomplete, i.e. auto-completion doesn't work properly. Additionally, the tags file once again needs to be updated manually.


I'm aware of the fact that not even modern, full-blown IDEs offer good C++ code completion. That's why I've accepted Vim's lack in this area until now. But I think a fundamental level of code completion isn't too much to ask, and is in fact required for productive usage. So I'm searching for something that can accomplish at least the following things.


Syntax awareness. cppcomplete promises (but doesn't deliver for me), correct, scope-aware auto-completion of the following:

variableName.abc
variableName-&gt;abc
typeName::abc


And really, anything else is completely useless.
Configurability. I need to specify (easily) where the source files are, and hence where the script gets its auto-completion information from. In fact, I've got a Makefile in my directory which specifies the required include paths. Eclipse can interpret the information found therein, why not a Vim script as well?
Up-to-dateness. As soon as I change something in my file, I want the auto-completion to reflect this. I do not want to manually trigger ctags (or something comparable). Also, changes should be incremental, i.e. when I've changed just one file it's completely unacceptable for ctags to re-parse the whole directory tree (which may be huge).


Did I forget anything? Feel free to update.

I'm comfortable with quite a lot of configuration and/or tinkering but I don't want to program a solution from scratch, and I'm not good at debugging Vim scripts.

A final note, I'd really like something similar for Java and C# but I guess that's too much to hope for: ctags only parses code files and both Java and C# have huge, precompiled frameworks that would need to be indexed. Unfortunately, developing .NET without an IDE is even more of a PITA than C++.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
Try YouCompleteMe. It uses Clang through the libclang interface, offering semantic C/C++/Objective-C completion. It's much like clang_complete, but substantially faster and with fuzzy-matching.

In addition to the above, YCM also provides semantic completion for C#, Python, Go, TypeScript etc. It also provides non-semantic, identifier-based completion for languages for which it doesn't have semantic support.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
There’s also clang_complete which uses the clang compiler to provide code completion for C++ projects. There’s another question with troubleshooting hints for this plugin.

The plugin seems to work fairly well as long as the project compiles, but is prohibitively slow for large projects (since it attempts a full compilation to generate the tags list).

I've been moving from C# in my professional career to looking at Ruby and RoR in my personal life, and I've found linux to be slightly more appealing personally for development.  Particularly now that I've started using git, the implementation is cleaner on linux.

Currently I'm dual booting and getting closer to running Ubuntu full time.  I'm using gedit with various plugins for the development environment. And as of late 2010, I'm making the push to use Vim for development, even over Textmate on OS X.

A large amount of the Rails developers are using (gasp) Macs, which has actually got me thinking in that direction.

Although I haven't tried it, Ruby in Steel gives you a Ruby IDE inside the Visual Studio world, and IronRuby is the .NET flavor of Ruby, if you're interested.

As far as books are concerned, the Programming Ruby (also known as the Pickaxe) book from the Pragmatic Programmers is the de-facto for learning Ruby.  I bit the bullet and purchased that book and Agile Web Development with Rails; both books have been excellent.

Peepcode screencasts and PDF books have also been great for getting started; at $9 per screencast it's hard to go wrong.  I actually bought a 5-pack.

Also check out the following:


Official Rails Guides
Railscasts
railsapi.com or Ruby on Rails - APIdock
The Ruby Show
Rails for Zombies
Softies on Rails - Ruby on Rails for .NET Developers
Rails Podcast
Rails Best Practices


I've burned through the backlog of Rails and Rails Envy podcasts in the past month and they have provided wonderful insight into lots of topics, even regarding software development in general.

Beware, the rails world is a massively frustrating mess of outdated and inconsistent documentation and examples.  It is maybe one of the fastest moving and most faddish development communities there is.  By the time you learn something it will already have changed.  Even the books are not consistent in which version of rails they are talking about.  Documentation by blogging!  enough said.  

I currently do RoR on windows.  My advice is to avoid windows if you can.  Lots of things don't work and the rails community really really doesn't care about you.  The move to Git has really messed me up since it doesn't work very well on windows.  A lot of gems will fail because of this (Heroku looks like a cool tool - too bad for me it can't handle window's Git setup).  Capistrano is out.  It goes on and annoyingly on.

Plus, in the back of your mind, you always wonder when something doesn't work "Is it a rails/windows problem?"  I am not sure this is solved by using linux because linux brings its own hassles like constantly having to upgrade all those different dependencies, etc...If that's the kind of thing you enjoy it might be an okay choice for you.  Those days of enjoying system fiddling are behind me and I just want to get on with doing my work.  I am planning on installing ubuntu on a home machine just so i can get familiar with things like capistrano so maybe my opinion will change.

I'd highly suggest if you are going to do rails dev for any amount of time you seriously consider getting a Mac.  If you value your time and sanity it will pay for itself almost instantly.  Depending on how you value your time 10 hours of debugging windows/linux setup problems and you have spend as much as a Mac costs anyway.

Rails is a joy compared to what it replaces but it is a bit of a pain in that its proponents skip right past a lot of the boring but important stuff like documentation, compatibility issues and community building.  It is way more powerful than other frameworks like Django but I sometimes look over at the Django documentation and community and sigh like a guy with a wild sexy girlfriend looking at his friend's plain but sane and stable wife.  But then rails adds a feature and I go "Ohhh shiny!"

IMO the Rails Screencasts are better than the Peepcode screencasts.  RubyPlus also has screencasts, mind you, they are bit rough around the edges.  BuildingWebApps has a free online course that starts doing screencasts halfway through.

Path of least resistance:


Have a simple web project in mind.
Go to rubyonrails.org and look at their "Blog in 15 minutes" screencast to get excited.
Get a copy of O'Reilly Media's Learning Ruby
Get a Mac or Linux box.
(Fewer early Rails frustrations due to the fact that Rails is generally developed on these.)
Get a copy of Agile Web Development with Rails.
Get the version of Ruby and Rails described in that book.
Run through that book's first section to get a feel for what it's like.
Go to railscasts.com and view at the earliest videos for a closer look.
Buy The Rails Way by Obie Fernandez to get a deeper understanding of Rails and what it's doing.
Then upgrade to the newest production version of Rails, and view the latest railscasts.com videos.

Answer 12: 

    
    
Fantastic decision! It is extremely useful to get a grounding in Ruby before going to Rails so here is my take on the best path to Rails:


Learn to Program by Chris Pine - You can read this in an afternoon to get a feel for the Ruby language.
The Well Grounded Rubyist by David Black - Like the title says it will give you an excellent grounding in the language.
Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen - This book is sublime, it reads like a novel.
Ruby Best Practices by Gregory Brown - By this point you should be ready for the advanced level of this book.
Rails for Zombies - Fun tutorial you can complete in an afternoon.
Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl - Fantastic (and free) tutorial and I have heard his accompanying screencasts are amazing.
Agile Web Development with Rails by Sam Ruby - By the time you are finished this you are now a completely capable Rails person!


Aside from books the most important thing is to get feedback on what you are doing. To do this I recommend spending time in irc.freenode.net #ruby and #rubyonrails. It is also extremely helpful to post things you are working on or having trouble with here on stackoverflow as the comments, explanations and different way of thinking about things that people provide are invaluable.

You should also definitely check out the Ruby Rogues podcast, they provide invaluable information and the commentators are all extremely respected people in the Ruby community. And for your viewing and reading pleasure (in that order,) head over to Ryan Bates's Railscasts and  then Eifion Bedford's Asciicasts.

Finally, I recommend looking into different gems on github, reading the code and then contributing to them. You don't have to get overly ambitious and do massive recodes, especially at first. Just start with small things like editing and making the README files a little easier to read.

I don't use an IDE but at Railsconf I saw a demo of Rubymine from Jetbrains and it seemed pretty amazing.

0) LEARN RUBY FIRST.  This is very important.  One huge advantage of Rails is Ruby: a great language that is very powerful but also marvelously easy to misunderstand.  Run through a few Ruby tutorials online.  When coding challenges come up on Daily WTF, write them in Ruby.  You'll pick it up fast.

1) Go buy the book "Ruby for Rails"

2) Check out a Rails tutorial and subscribe to the Riding Rails blog.

3) Standup an app locally.  Don't use scaffolding.

4) When you install plugins into your app, go look at the code in that plugin (in your vendor directory) and learn it.  It is one of the best ways to learn Ruby and Rails internals.  When you don't understand how something works, post it here and 1,000 people will help you.

As for your other questions:

Yes, you will need a Linux environment to develop in.  You can develop Rails on Windows, but that doesn't mean it should be done.  Lots of gems aren't up to speed on Windows.

NetBeans works well as an IDE.  If you're on a Mac, you'll get street cred for using Textmate.

I'm surprised there has been so little mention of Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby. Why may not be around anymore but the guide is easy to find on the net (Google points here first) it's a very easy read and provided my introduction to Ruby.

After the guide, I'd recommend either one of the books the others have suggested, or following  the series of screencasts at Learning Rails which is how I picked up enough Ruby on Rails to be dangerous. Once you've completed the Learning Rails series. what you want to do with Rails will start to diverge from the general tutorials and that's where Railscasts becomes a wonderful tool. There's not much can be done with Rails that Railscasts hasn't touched on at some point.
    
    
Answer 16: 

    
    
My first suggestion would be to learn a little about symbols first. Rails isn't the smallest framework ever, and while there's definitely lots to learn, most of it will start to make sense if you have at least a little bit of understanding what makes it different ("special") from other languages. As pointed out, there's no exact analog in any of the major languages, but they're heavily used by Rails, in order to make things read straightforwardly and perform well, which is the reason I brought it up. My very first exposure to Rails was also my first time looking at Ruby (well before 2.0), and the first thing that caught my eye was the goofy :things they were passing around, and I asked, "WTF is that?" 

Also, check out RubyQuiz, and read other peoples' answers on that site.

I came from a Java background to Ruby to.  I found this tutorial helpful http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/to-ruby-from-java/. When it comes to learning rails I cannot say how much I use script\console.  It allows you to play with the code and learn how to do things that you are not sure about.

The only book I ever bought was Agile Web Development with Rails, Third Edition http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition.  It was quite useful and provided a good overview of the Rails framework.  In addition to that I regular watch Railscasts(http://railscasts.com), which is a great screen casting blog that covers all kinds of Rails topics.

I personally prefer using Linux (because git works better).  But, I have also used windows and besides git I do not think the OS choice will impact your programming.  

I use netbeans for my IDE and occasionally vim (with the rails plugin).  I like netbeans but, I find that it can still be a little flaky when it comes to the Rails support (not all the features work all the time).

I used to do Java and C# on Windoze.

I'd second these sources:

IDE: Try Apatana RadRails 3 Sneak Peek: http://www.radrails.org/3. Its the closest thing you'll get to Visual Studio. I play with it here and there but still love the lightness of Textmate.

OS: Mac OS gets the most if not all love from Ruby community. Anything else is treated like a bastard child.

Books:


The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide (the pickaxe book)
Agile Web Development with Rails


Screencasts:


Peepcode (pay) is a nice way to pick up concepts quickly
Railscasts (free) is a good weekly way to pick up new gems and concepts incrementally
Railscasts (pro) is also a good way to pick up concepts for a pretty low price.

A quick cookbook is Ruby on Rails: Up and Running you can get it from O'Rielly or search Google for a on-line version. They walk you though the conventions of Rails and use Instant Rails which is ok.

A better Rails book "Agile Web Development with Rails" This is the soups to nuts of Rails. It walks you though downloading and setting up Rails, Gems, everything.

If you want are a Java 'guy' and want a transition book O'Reilly has "Rails for Java Developers" http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780977616695/?CMP=AFC-ak_book&amp;ATT=Rails+for+Java+Developers

Oh I almost forgot.  Here are a few more Ruby screencast resources:

SD Ruby - the have a bunch of videos online - I found their Rest talks SD9 and SD10 to be among the best of the intros.  Other rest talks assume you know everything.  These ones are very introductory and to the point.

Obie Fernandez on InfoQ - Restful Rails.  I've also read his Rails Way book and found it informative but really long winded and meandering and the quality is a bit inconsistent.  I learned a lot from this book but felt it was a bit punishing to have to read through the repetition and irrelevant stuff to get to the good bits.  

Netbeans is a nice hand holding IDE that can teach you a lot of language tricks if you have the patience to wait for its tooltips (it is a painfully slow IDE even on a really fast machine) and you can use the IDE to graphically browse through the available generators and stuff like that.  Get the latest builds and you even have Rspec test running built in.

Bort is a prebuilt base app with a lot of the standard plugins already plugged in.  If you download it and play with it and figure out how it is setup you are about halfway to creating your own full featured apps.

I bought the book "Simply Rails 2" by Patrick Lenz.
This book is a great introduction to Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
As for my ruby installation and db, I used Cygwin.
It comes with PostgreSQL, ruby and svn.
I like PostgreSQL because I come from an Oracle
background so it feels more comfortable than MySQL.  

The other utility I found really useful was pgAdmin
for accessing the PostgreSQL databases.

The first thing I needed to do was to get gems installed.
I got the gems tar file from rubyforge
wget "http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/60718/rubygems-1.3.5.tgz"  

Once I had gems setup, I installed  

rails
ruby-postgres
postgres
rack  

I also needed an issue tracking system so I installed redmine.
wget "http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/60718/rubygems-1.3.5.tgz"  

I found that using a UNIX-like environment (Cygwin) was
preferable in my case because many of the tutorials were
taylored for OS X or Linux.  

The text editor I use is Textpad.  I'm looking for an alternative.
I think that vim with the rails plugin might work nicely.

I come from a non-programming background. I have learned PHP on my own and recently joined a firm that specializes in Ruby on Rails. They have a comprehensive Rails training program, which is flexible enough to accommodate whatever changes we want to implement. Though I am not a rails pro, I would like to share my experience with rails. I hope that it helps.

Here is the path I am following [combined with tools I am using]


Start with a simple ruby guide. It will help a lot, since entire rails framework revolves around classes and objects.
Environment and OS are not important. Though I am working on a Mac, I frequently work on Linux and Windows, and I do not face any problems.
Start with a good book which explains using a demo app. [I am using Agile Web Development with Rails - By The Pragmatic Bookshelf]. There are many other good books as well.
Once you are done with the application, you will have a good idea of the framework. 


Try to understand the SQL queries generated by Active Record module. 
Go through the Rails Guides. You will find the framework a lot easier.

Keep practicing.


Few imp points


It takes years to learn a language completely. So be patient and do not stop learning.
Go through rails api as when required. [While developing your first app]
Google the things which you do not understand. People have written great articles on almost all topics.
Use Stackoverflow :-) [Only when you are not able to find the solution on your own.]
Load railscasts on your phone or video player. Watch 'em while travelling or in your free time. They are of few minutes each. You will learn a great deal of things and also learn the best way of doing things.


Tools


Shell [in Mac and Ubuntu]
Editor [Textmate in Mac, Gedit in Ubuntu and Notepad++ in Windows]
Firefox with Firebug installed for testing.


Finally I have one thing to say "Keep trying". All the best.

The fastest way to learn anything, Ruby on Rails included, is pair programming.

Answer 26: 

    
    
My suggestion is just to start - pick a small project that you would generally use to learn an MVC-style language (i.e. something with a database, maybe some basic workflow), and then as you need to learn a concept, use one (or both!) of

Agile Web Development with Rails
or
The Rails Way

to learn about how it works, and then try it.

The problems with Agile Web Development are that it's outdated, and that the scenario runs on too long for you really to want to build it once; The Rails Way can be hard to follow as it bounces from reference to learning, but when it's good, it's better than Agile Web Development. 

But overall they're both good books, and they're both good for learning, but neither of them provide an "education" path that you'll want to follow. So I read a few chapters of the former (enough to get the basic concepts and learn how to bootstrap the first app - there are some online articles that help with this as well) and then just got started, and then every few days I read about something new or I use the books to understand something.

One more thing: both books are much more Rails books than they are Ruby books, and if you're going to write clean code, it's worth spending a day learning Ruby syntax as early as possible. Why's Guide to Ruby is a good one, there are others as well.

There is a site called Softies on Rails that is written by a couple of ex-.NET developers that may be of some use. They have a book called Rails for .NET Developers coming out in the next few months...

As for books, I started with The Ruby Way and Agile Web Development with Rails. It definately helps to build a background in Ruby as you start to make your way into Rails development.

Title: How to jump back to NERDTree from file in tab?
Description: 
    
    
                    
I usually:


Choose the needed file.
Open it in a tab(t character, by default).


But how I can jump back to NERDTree to open one more file in a tab?

Temporary solution I use now in my .vimrc file:

map &lt;F10&gt; :NERDTree /path/to/root/of/my/project


But it's not very useful to start navigation again and again from the root directory.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
If you use T instead of t there is no need to jump back because the new tab will be opened, but vim's focus will simply remain within NERDTree.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Ctrl-ww

This will move between open windows (so you could hop between the NERDTree window, the file you are editing and the help window, for example... just hold down Ctrl and press w twice).
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Ctrl+ww cycle though all windows

Ctrl+wh takes you left a window  

Ctrl+wj takes you down a window

Ctrl+wk takes you up a window

Ctrl+wl takes you right a window
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
NERDTree opens up in another window.  That split view you're seeing?  They're called windows in vim parlance.  All the window commands start with CTRL-W.  To move from adjacent windows that are left and right of one another, you can change focus to the window to the left of your current window with CTRL-w h, and move focus to the right with CTRL-w l.  Likewise, CTRL-w j and CTRL-w k will move you between horizontally split windows (i.e., one window is above the other).  There's a lot more you can do with windows as described here.

You can also use the :NERDTreeToggle command to make your tree open and close.  I usually bind that do t.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
You can focus on a split window using # ctrl-ww.

for example, pressing:

1 ctrl-ww


would focus on the first window, usually being NERDTree.
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
ctrl-ww Could be useful when you have limited tabs open. But could get annoying when you have too many tabs open. 

I type in :NERDTree again to get the focus back on NERDTree tab instantly wherever my cursor's focus is. Hope that helps
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Since it's not mentioned and it's really helpful:

ctrl-wp

which I memorize as go to the previously selected window.

It works as a there and back command. After having opened a new file from the tree in a new window press ctrl-wp to switch back to the NERDTree and use it again to return to your previous window.

PS: it is worth to mention that ctrl-wp is actually documented as go to the preview window (see: :help preview-window and :help ctrl-w). 

It is also the only keystroke which works to switch inside and explore the COC preview documentation window.
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
You can change the tabs by ctrl-pgup and ctrl-pgdown. On that tab you came from the NERDTree is still selected and you can open another tab.
    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
In more recent versions of NERDTree you can use the command :NERDTreeFocus, which will move focus to the NERDTree window.

I'm working on some legacy code that has a class that is 10,000+ lines of code and has 100s of methods. Is there a shortcut for any JetBrains IDE (since the shortcut would likely be shared across all of them) to collapse all the methods / functions so that only the method signatures are shown?

Title: Difference between WebStorm and PHPStorm
Description: 
    
    
                    
I'm choosing an IDE for web development and I would like to know what the differences between WebStorm and PHPStorm are.

I couldn't find any major points on JetBrains' website and even Google didn't help that much.

All I know now is that PHPStorm doesn't support JS like WebStorm, but is able to due to plugins. Is this the only difference?

You should train your search-fu twice as harder.

FROM: http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/


  NOTE: PhpStorm includes all the functionality of WebStorm (HTML/CSS Editor, JavaScript Editor) and adds full-fledged support for PHP and Databases/SQL.


Their forum also has quite few answers for such question.



Basically: PhpStorm = WebStorm + PHP + Database support

WebStorm comes with certain (mainly) JavaScript oriented plugins bundled by default while they need to be installed manually in PhpStorm (if necessary).

At the same time: plugins that require PHP support would not be able to install in WebStorm (for obvious reasons).

P.S.
Since WebStorm has different release cycle than PhpStorm, it can have new JS/CSS/HTML oriented features faster than PhpStorm (it's all about platform builds used). 

For example: latest stable PhpStorm is v7.1.4 while WebStorm is already on v8.x. But, PhpStorm v8 will be released in approximately 1 month (accordingly to their road map), which means that stable version of PhpStorm will include some of the features that will only be available in WebStorm v9 (quite few months from now, lets say 2-3-5) -- if using/comparing stable versions ONLY.

UPDATE (2016-12-13):
Since 2016.1 version PhpStorm and WebStorm use the same version/build numbers .. so there is no longer difference between the same versions: functionality present in WebStorm 2016.3 is the same as in PhpStorm 2016.3 (if the same plugins are installed, of course).




  Everything that I know atm. is that PHPStorm doesn't support JS part like Webstorm


That's not correct (your wording). Missing "extra" technology in PhpStorm (for example: node, angularjs) does not mean that basic JavaScript support has missing functionality. Any "extras" can be easily installed (or deactivated, if not required).



UPDATE (2016-12-13):
Here is the list of plugins that are bundled with WebStorm 2016.3 but require manual installation in PhpStorm 2016.3 (if you need them, of course):


Cucumber.js
Dart
EditorConfig
EJS
Handelbars/Mustache
Java Server Pages (JSP) Integration
Karma
LiveEdit
Meteor
PhoneGap/Cordova Plugin
Polymer &amp; Web Components
Pug (ex-Jade)
Spy-js
Stylus support
Yeoman

    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
Essentially, PHPStorm = WebStorm + PHP, SQL and more.

BUT (and this is a very important "but") because it is capable of parsing so much more, it quite often fails to parse Node.js dependencies, as they (probably) conflict with some other syntax it is capable of parsing.

The most notable example of that would be Mongoose model definition, where WebStorm easily recognizes mongoose.model method, whereas PHPStorm marks it as unresolved as soon as you connect Node.js plugin.

Surprisingly, it manages to resolve the method if you turn the plugin off, but leave the core modules connected, but then it cannot be used for debugging. And this happens to quite a few methods out there.

All this goes for PHPStorm 8.0.1, maybe in later releases this annoying bug would be fixed. 
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
There is actually a comparison of the two in the official WebStorm FAQ.  However, the version history of that page shows it was last updated December 13, so I'm not sure if it's maintained. 

This is an extract from the FAQs for reference:


  What is WebStorm &amp; PhpStorm?
  
  WebStorm &amp; PhpStorm are IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)
  built on top of JetBrains IntelliJ platform and narrowed for web
  development.
  
  Which IDE do I need?
  
  PhpStorm is designed to cover all needs of PHP developer including
  full JavaScript, CSS and HTML support. WebStorm is for hardcore
  JavaScript developers. It includes features PHP developer normally
  doesn’t need like Node.JS or JSUnit. However corresponding plugins can
  be installed into PhpStorm for free.
  
  How often new vesions (sic) are going to be released?
  
  Preliminarily, WebStorm and PhpStorm major updates will be available
  twice in a year. Minor (bugfix) updates are issued periodically as
  required.
  
  snip
  
  IntelliJ IDEA vs WebStorm features
  
  IntelliJ IDEA remains JetBrains' flagship product and IntelliJ IDEA
  provides full JavaScript support along with all other features of
  WebStorm via bundled or downloadable plugins. The only thing missing
  is the simplified project setup.

    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
I use IntelliJ Idea, PHPStorm, and WebStorm.  I thought WebStorm would be sufficient for PHP coding, but in reality it's great for editing but doesn't feel like it real-time-error-checks PHP as well as PHPStorm.  This is just an observation, coming from a regular user of a JetBrains products.  

If you're a student try taking advantage of the free license while attending school; it gives you a chance to explore different JetBrains IDE...  Did I mention CLion?  =]
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    

  PhpStorm supports all the features of WebStorm but some are not bundled so you might need to install the corresponding plugin for some framework via Settings 
Answer 6: 

    
    
In my own experience, even though theoretically many JetBrains products share the same functionalities, the new features that get introduced in some apps don't get immediately introduced in the others. In particular, IntelliJ IDEA has a new version once per year, while WebStorm and PHPStorm get 2 to 3 per year I think. Keep that in mind when choosing an IDE. :)
    
    
Title: Xcode 4 - build output directory
Description: 
    
    
                    
I have problems with setting up/locating my output files in Xcode4 (beta 5). They are placed somewhere in ~/Library/Developer/ugly_path/.... I can't even select "show in finder" on my products. It is the same for a simple C project, Foundation tool and even Cocoa bundle. A Debugging works fine.

Could you please point me out where and how to set up / build output directories? (I know it sounds dumb, I've been coding in Xcode3 for months, but I can't figure it out in Xcode4 beta).

Thanks a lot.
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
From the Xcode menu on top, click preferences, select the locations tab, look at the build location option.

You have 2 options:


Place build products in derived data location (recommended)
Place build products in locations specified by targets


Update:
On xcode 4.6.2 you need to click the advanced button on the right side below the derived data text field. Build Location select legacy.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
If you build from command line, you can set output directory in the following way:

xcodebuild -workspace 'WORKSPACE_NAME.xcworkspace' \
           -scheme 'SCHEME_NAME' \
           -configuration 'Release' \
           -sdk iphoneos7.0 CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR='OUTPUT_DIRECTORY'

In Xcode 5: Xcode menu strong/strong
Answer 4: 

    
    
If you have Xcode 4 Build Location setting set to "Place build products in derived data location (recommended), it should be located in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData. This directory will have your project in there as a directory, the project name will be appended with a bunch of generated letters so look carefully.
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
Keep derived data but use the DSTROOT to specify the destination. 

Use DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION to force deployment. 

Use the undocumented DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH to copy the dSYM over too. 

This allows you to use derived data location from xcodebuild and not have to do wacky stuff to find the app.

xcodebuild -sdk "iphoneos" -workspace Foo.xcworkspace -scheme Foo -configuration "Debug" DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION=YES DSTROOT=tmp DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH=tmp build

    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
You can always find the build directory by looking in the build log viewer, and copying the path there into a terminal window.

I use this to analyze my iOS .app bundles before they get installed to make sure no stray files are being included.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
For anyone who wants to find the build directory from a script but does not want to change it, run the following to get a list of all the build settings that point to a folder in DerivedData:

xcodebuild -showBuildSettings | grep DerivedData


If you run custom targets and schemes, please put them there as well:

xcodebuild -workspace "Foo.xcworkspace" -scheme "Bar" -sdk iphonesimulator -configuration Debug -showBuildSettings | grep DerivedData


Look at the output to locate the setting output that you want and then:

xcodebuild -showBuildSettings | grep SYMROOT | cut -d "=" -f 2 - | sed 's/^ *//'


The last part cuts the string at the equal sign and then trims the whitespace at the beginning.
    
    
Answer 8: 

    
    
If you use the new Xcode4 Workspaces, you can change the Derived Data Location under File -strong/strong/p/div
Answer 9: 

    
    
You can configure the output directory using the CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR environment variable.

[Update]
This is fixed in Android Studio 1.1
https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37015035


  In the next version of Android Studio, if no java 6 is found but 7 (or greater) is found then it will use that instead. We still recommend running studio with Java 6 due to improved font rendering, but there is no work around needed if, for example, only java 8 is found.  


[End Update]

From Android Studio 1.0 RC3 Notes


  As of RC 3, we have a better mechanism for customizing properties for the launchers on all three platforms. You should not edit any files in the IDE installation directory. Instead, you can customize the attributes by creating your own .properties or .vmoptions files in the following directories. (This has been possible on some platforms before, but it required you to copy and change the entire contents of the files. With the latest changes these properties are now additive instead such that you can set just the attributes you care about, and the rest will use the defaults from the IDE installation).


However there is no explanation about what options are.

After searching a little I found this
Adjusting VM Options for Android Studio on Mac
IntelliJ IDEA 14.0.0 Web Help/File IDEA.Properties

However no luck with that.

Fortunately I was able to resolve it on Yosemite using environment variables as said in the 1.0 RC3 Release Notes.


  You can also place use environment variables to point to specific override files elsewhere:
  STUDIO_VM_OPTIONS, which vmoptions file to use
  STUDIO_PROPERTIES, which property file to use
  STUDIO_JDK, which JDK to run studio with


This was a little tricky because Android Studio is not a command line application so I had to use a AppleScript command to set the environment variable when login. More info here

This is my launchctl command for the command line.  

launchctl setenv STUDIO_JDK /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk


And this my AppleScript (remember to save it as an Application)  

do shell script "launchctl setenv STUDIO_JDK /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk"


About launchctl, see here
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
Note that this last variable allows you to for example run Android Studio with Java 7 on OSX (which normally picks Java 6 from the version specified in Info.plist):

$ export STUDIO_JDK=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_67.jdk

$ open /Applications/Android\ Studio.app

Worked for me
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    


Change this key in the Info.plist 

I changed from

&lt;key&gt;JVMVersion&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;1.6*&lt;/string&gt;


to

&lt;key&gt;JVMVersion&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;1.8*&lt;/string&gt;


and it worked fine now..

As a novice user it took me a while to understand how to fix this in a correct way. After searching and understating many answers on SO I came out with the Following steps that you need to follow to fix the issue.

Please Note:

Although the simplest solution is to update the Info.plist of android studio . But it is not recommended and not the correct way to fix it .

Official statement- "Please note: Do not edit Info.plist to pick a different version. That will break not only the application signature, but also future patch updates to your installation."

First Solution : If you run your Android Studio from command line, you can add these two lines into your .bash_profile 

$ export STUDIO_JDK=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_67.jdk

$ open /Applications/Android\ Studio.app


From next time whenever you open your terminal your studio will start automatically.

Second Solution: If you want to run Android Studio from UI(by click on Icon) follow below steps:


Open script editor on mac(one can find it in spotlight)
Copy past the below line

do shell script "launchctl setenv STUDIO_JDK /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk"


Note :- Change the jdk version according to your version. To check which version you are using open terminal and run the following command 

java -version


3.Now save (⌘+s) as File format: Application. Finally open System Settings → Users &amp; Groups → Login Items and add your new application that you have just created.


Log-off and login again or you can run that application manually as well..


woolaaaa…Its done.

Install newest JDK (8u102 current)
Set envirionment variable STUDIO_JDK (java_home outputs the Java home dir and sed strips two folders to get the jdk dir)

launchctl setenv STUDIO_JDK `/usr/libexec/java_home -version 1.8 | sed 's/\/Contents\/Home//g'`

Launch Android Studio like you would normally


Set STUDIO_JDK on every reboot

The above steps only works for the current session. Here is how to create a plist file in /Library/LaunchDaemons that runs the above command on every boot:

sudo defaults write /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.studiojdk Label STUDIO_JDK
sudo defaults write /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.studiojdk ProgramArguments -array /bin/launchctl setenv STUDIO_JDK `/usr/libexec/java_home | sed 's/\/Contents\/Home//g'`
sudo defaults write /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.studiojdk RunAtLoad -bool TRUE

On Android Tools Project Site, there is a great explanation Mac OSX JDK Selection. It fixed my problem. In summary:


  Android Studio requires two different JDKs:
  
  
  The version of Java that the IDE itself runs with. 
  The version of the JDK that it uses to get the Java compiler from
  
  
  These two can be (and usually are) the same, but you can configure
  them individually. And on OSX in particular, they will often be
  different.


and for Yosemite (Mac OSX 10.10) Issues:


  First, please make sure that you have the latest version of Java 6
  installed; in some cases that has fixed the problems:
  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572
  
  If not, try running a recent version of Java 7 or Java 8 instead by
  setting STUDIO_JDK as described above. That is reported to have fixed
  the other problems (though you will get the font rendering shown for
  Java 8 above.)

Edit the android studio's Info.plist file in the package so that it uses 1.7 or whatever JVMVersion you have installed. Changing the JVMVersion to 1.6+ instead of 1.6* as hasternet answered above should work too.

  As of RC 3, we have a better mechanism for customizing properties for

You can implement the STUDIO_JDK solution using your user's launch agents. This involves creating one plist file in your LaunchAgents directory, located at ~/Library/LaunchAgents 

Create a new file, ~/Library/LaunchAgents/UNIQUE_KEY.plist, where UNIQUE_KEY is just an identifier. I use com.username.androidstudio.

Copy the following text into your new plist file and modify it according the instructions below.

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
   &lt;string&gt;UNIQUE_KEY&lt;/string&gt;
   &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
   &lt;array&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;sh&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;launchctl setenv STUDIO_JDK /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_71.jdk&lt;/string&gt;
   &lt;/array&gt;
   &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
   &lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;


You will need to make two modifications:


Change UNIQUE_KEY to match your filename (without the .plist extension).
Verify your JDK path is correct and change if necessary. I'm using 7u71 in this example.


This is the same underlying solution as Antonio Jose's answer. It sets the STUDIO_JDK environment variable based on the Android Studio version 1.0 RC3 release notes. This solution uses the LaunchAgents directory rather than AppleScript to set the environment variable. As such it is mostly a difference in how your order and organize your system and environment variables.

Do not edit the plist. These instructions worked for me the first time I installed Android Studio a few months ago as well as just today. (1/21/2015)

All you need to do is a few simple things, although they aren't really listed on Google's website.


First you need Java installed. this is not the JDK, it is seperate. You can get that from this link. If you don't have this it will probably throw an error saying something like "no JVM installed."
Second you need the Java JDK, I got JDK 7 from this link. Make sure to choose the Mac OS X link under the  Java SE Development Kit 7u75 heading. If you don't have this it will probably throw an error saying something like "no JDK installed."
If you haven't already installed Android Studio, do that. But I'm sure you've already done that by now.

For those who were having trouble creating a script that launched on startup, as an alternative you can add this .plist to your LaunchAgents folder. This may be a more appropriate way of adding environment variables to the system since Yosemite decided to do away with launchd.conf. This should also work across user accounts due to the nature of the LaunchAgents folder, but I haven't tested that.

To do this, create a .plist file with the following name and path:

/Library/LaunchAgents/setenv.STUDIO_JDK.plist


and the contents:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;setenv.STUDIO_JDK&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;array&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;sh&lt;/string&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;
                    launchctl setenv STUDIO_JDK /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk
                &lt;/string&gt;
            &lt;/array&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;true/&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;ServiceIPC&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;false/&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;LaunchOnlyOnce&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;true/&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;false/&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;


Then change file properties by running the following commands in Terminal:

sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchAgents/setenv.STUDIO_JDK.plist

sudo chown root /Library/LaunchAgents/setenv.STUDIO_JDK.plist

sudo chgrp wheel /Library/LaunchAgents/setenv.STUDIO_JDK.plist


Notes:

1) You may need to change 'jdk1.8.0_25.jdk' to match the version that you have on your computer.

2) I tried to use "jdk1.8.*.jdk" to try and account for varying Java * versions, but when I opened Android Studio I got the no JVM error even though if you run "echo $STUDIO_JDK" it returns the correct path. Perhaps someone has some insight as to how to fix that issue.

This workaround works most of the time. It uses eclipse's 'smart insert' features instead:


Control X to erase the selected block of text, and keep it for pasting.
Control+Shift Enter, to open a new line for editing above the one you are at.
You might want to adjust the tabbing position at this point. This is where tabbing will start, unless you are at the beginning of the line.
Control V to paste back the buffer.


Hope this helps until Shift+TAB is implemented in Eclipse.

UPDATE: it works on multi-newlines, if the multi-lines have the same level of indentation. It should just continue outdenting the other lines that haven't reached the beginning of the new line yet. Is there an option to change this I wonder?

When adding an activity to an existing Android project, I manually create a new class - is that the best / preferred way? How do others handle that?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You can use the "New Class" dialog, but that leaves other steps you need to do by hand (e.g. adding an entry to the manifest file). If you want those steps to be automated, you can create the activity via the manifest editor like this:


Double click on AndroidManifest.xml in the package explorer.
Click on the "Application" tab of the manifest editor
Click on "Add.." under the "Application Nodes" heading (bottom left of the screen)
Choose Activity from the list in the dialog that pops up (if you have the option, you want to create a new top-level element)
Click on the "Name*" link under the "Attributes for" header (bottom right of the window) to create a class for the new activity.


When you click Finish from the new class dialog, it'll take you to your new activity class so you can start coding.

Five steps might seem a lot, but I'm just trying to be extra detailed here so that it's clear. It's pretty quick when you actually do it.

Description: 
    
    
                    
Is there a way in Xcode to find all the places where a method or property has been been called?

In Eclipse, for example, you can right-click a method and select Find references. Is there anything similar in Xcode?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    

Select the method you're interested in, or position the text cursor within it.
Open the "Related Files" menu via the icon at the top-left of the Editor. (It's the button immediately to the left of the back button).
Go to the "Callers" submenu for a list of all methods that call the selected method, and click any of them to jump to that file and method.


In pictures...





A couple of notes:


You can do this for properties too.
Note that when you select a calling method from the Callers menu to jump to where your method was called, Xcode highlights only the first call. Each calling method will only show up in the 'Callers' list once, even if it contains many calls to your method. So if you're trying to make some change at every place in your application where a method is called, be careful not to miss some in places where a calling method contains two calls to the method you're interested in.

View the details of a commit, such as author name, email, date, committer name, email, date and comments.
View a previous copy of the file or compare it against the local
workspace version or a previous version.
View the changes to the active line in the editor (Git Blame).
Configure the information displayed in the list

Title: Using Emacs as an IDE
Description: 
    
    
                    
Currently my workflow with Emacs when I am coding in C or C++ involves three windows.  The largest on the right contains the file I am working with.  The left is split into two, the bottom being a shell which I use to type in compile or make commands, and the top is often some sort of documentation or README file that I want to consult while I am working.  Now I know there are some pretty expert Emacs users out there, and I am curious what other Emacs functionally is useful if the intention is to use it as a complete IDE.  Specifically, most IDEs usually fulfill these functions is some form or another:


Source code editor
Compiler
Debugging
Documentation Lookup
Version Control
OO features like class lookup and object inspector 


For a few of these, it's pretty obvious how Emacs can fit these functions, but what about the rest?  Also, if a specific language must be focused on, I'd say it should be C++. 

Edit: One user pointed out that I should have been more specific when I said 'what about the rest'.  Mostly I was curious about efficient version control, as well as documentation lookup.  For example, in SLIME it is fairly easy to do a quick hyperspec lookup on a Lisp function.  Is there a quick way to look up something in C++ STL documentation (if I forgot the exact syntax of hash_map, for example)?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
You'll have to be specific as to what you mean by "the rest".  Except for the object inspector (that I"m aware of), emacs does all the above quite easily:


editor (obvious)
compiler - just run M-x compile and enter your compile command.  From there on, you can just M-x compile and use the default.  Emacs will capture C/C++ compiler errors (works best with GCC) and help you navigate to lines with warnings or errors.
Debugging - similarly, when you want to debug, type M-x gdb and it will create a gdb buffer with special bindings
Documentation Lookup - emacs has excellent CScope bindings for code navigation.  For other documentation: Emacs also has a manpage reader, and for everything else, there's the web and books.
version control - there are lots of Emacs bindings for various VCS backends (CVS, SCCS, RCS, SVN, GIT all come to mind)


Edit: I realize my answer about documentation lookup really pertained to code navigation.  Here's some more to-the-point info:  


Looking up manpages, info manuals, and Elisp documentation from within emacs
Looking up Python documentation from within Emacs.  


Google searching will no doubt reveal further examples.

As the second link shows, looking up functions (and whatever) in other documentation can be done, even if not supported out of the box.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
I have to recommend Emacs Code Browser as a more "traditional" IDE style environment for emacs.

EDIT: I also now recommend Magit highly over the standard VCS interface in emacs.
    
    
Answer 3: 

    
    
Instead of running a make command in the shell window, have you tried M-x compile? It will run your make command, display errors, and in many cases make it very easy to jump to the line of code that caused the error if the output includes filenames and line numbers.

If you're a fan of IDEs, you might also want to look at emacs' speedbar package (M-x speedbar). And, if you haven't already,  learn about how to use tags tables to navigate your code.
    
    
Answer 4: 

    
    
There are corners of emacs that once discovered make you more productive in ways you never thought of. As others have mentioned, using tags is a fantastic and fast way to zoom around your source code and using M-/ (dabbrev-expand) often does exactly what you expect when completing a variable name. 

Using occur is useful to get a buffer with all occurences of a regular expression in a buffer. That's really handy when refactoring code and looking for fragments of code or uses of variables, or if you use TODO markers in your source files and you want to visit them all.

flush-lines, sort-numeric-fields, replace-regexp and rectangle functions can be really useful for taking a dump from some tool and converting it to useful data such as an elisp program or a comma delimited spreadsheet. 

I wrote a page about IDE like things you can do with emacs 

http://justinsboringpage.blogspot.com/2007/09/11-visual-studio-tricks-in-emacs.html

Learning elisp is a another great way to answer for yourself what else emacs can do beyond what a typical IDE can do. 

For example I've blogged about writing Perforce helper functions like blame (writing your own means you can make it behave exactly as you want)...

http://justinsboringpage.blogspot.com/2009/01/who-changed-line-your-working-on-last.html

I've also written code that dynamically creates comments for a function at point, that matches the coding standards I'm working with. 

None of my elisp code is particularly great, and most of it exists already in libraries, but it's really useful to be able to make emacs do custom stuff that just comes up during a working day. 
    
    
Answer 5: 

    
    
You can find detailed description of emacs &amp; version control integration on my site.  I'm also working on article about using Emacs as Development Environment for many languages - C/C++, Java, Perl, Lisp/Scheme, Erlang, etc...
    
    
Answer 6: 

    
    
For version control, there are several things that you can use, depending on what version control system you use. But some of the functionality is common to all of them.

vc.el is the built-in way to handle version control at a file level. It has backends for most version control systems. For instance, the Subversion backend comes with Emacs, and there are git backends and others available from other sources.

The most useful command is C-x v v (vc-next-action) that does the appropriate next action for the file you are visiting. This might mean updating from the repository or commiting your changes, vc.el also rebinds C-x C-q to check in and out files if you are using a system that needs it (like RCS).

Other very useful commands are C-x v l and C-x v = that show you the log and current diff for the file you are using.

But for real productivity, you should avoid using the single-file vc.el commands other than for simple things. There are several packages that can give you an overview of the status of your whole tree, and give you more power, and not to mention the ability to create coherent commits spanning several files.

Most of these are heavily influenced or based on the original pcl-cvs/pcvs for CVS. There are even two of them that comes with subversion, psvn.el and dsvn.el. There are packages for git etc.
    
    
Answer 7: 

    
    
Okay, everyone here is giving perfect hints to make emacs a great IDE. 

But anyone should keep in mind that, when you customize your emacs with a lot of extension (especially with the ones for type-checking on the fly, function definition lookups etc) your emacs will load very, very slow for an editor. 

To workaround this, I would highly recommend to use emacs in server mode. 

It is pretty simple to use, no need to customize your init file.
You just need to start emacs in daemon mode;

emacs --daemon


This will create an emacs server, then you can connect it either from terminal, or from gui. I'd also recommend to create some aliases to make it easy to call. 

alias ec="emacsclient -t"
alias ecc="emacsclient -c &amp;"
# some people also prefer this but no need to fight here;
alias vi="emacsclient -t"


This way, emacs will fire up even faster than gedit, promise.

The one possible problem here, if you are running emacs daemon from your casual user, you probably can't connect emacs server as root.  

So, if you need to open a file that has root access; use tramp instead. Just run your emacs client with your normal user and open files like this;

C-x C-f
/sudo:root@localhost/some/file/that/has/root/access/permissions
# on some linux distro it might be `/su:root@...` 


This made my life easier, I can open my heavy customized python IDE in miliseconds this way. You may also want to add emacs --daemon to your system startup, or create a desktop file for emacsclient. Thats up to you. 

More on emacs daemon and emacs client can be found at wiki;

Answer 8: 

    
    
I agree that you should learn about M-x compile (bind that and M-x next-error to a short key sequence).

Learn about the bindings for version control (e.g. vc-diff, vc-next-action, etc.)

Look into registers.  You not only can remember locations in buffers but whole window configurations (C-x r w -- window-configuration-to-register).
    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
A starting point (which may be non-obvious) for exploring the VC features of Emacs is M-x vc-next-action. 

It does the "next logical version control operation" on the current file, depending on the state of the file and the VC backend. So if the file is not under version control, it registers it, if the file has been changed, the changes are submitted etc. 

It takes a little getting used to, but I find it very useful.

There's a TFS.el for emacs integration into Microsoft TFS. It works with any TFS, including the TFS that runs Codeplex.com.  

Basic steps to setup:


Place tfs.el in your load-path.
In your .emacs file:  

(require 'tfs)
(setq tfs/tf-exe  "c:\\vs2008\\common7\\ide\\tf.exe")
(setq tfs/login "/login:domain\\userid,password")
      -or-
(setq tfs/login (getenv "TFSLOGIN"))  ;; if you have this set

also in your .emacs file, set local or global key bindings for tfs commands.  like so:

(global-set-key  "\C-xvo" 'tfs/checkout)
(global-set-key  "\C-xvi" 'tfs/checkin)
(global-set-key  "\C-xvp" 'tfs/properties)
(global-set-key  "\C-xvr" 'tfs/rename)
(global-set-key  "\C-xvg" 'tfs/get)
(global-set-key  "\C-xvh" 'tfs/history)
(global-set-key  "\C-xvu" 'tfs/undo)
(global-set-key  "\C-xvd" 'tfs/diff)
(global-set-key  "\C-xv-" 'tfs/delete)
(global-set-key  "\C-xv+" 'tfs/add)
(global-set-key  "\C-xvs" 'tfs/status)
(global-set-key  "\C-xva" 'tfs/annotate)
(global-set-key  "\C-xvw" 'tfs/workitem)

compile, next-error, and previous-error are all pretty important commands for C++ development in Emacs (works great on grep output too).  Etags, visit-tags-table, and find-tag are important as well.  completion.el is one of the great unsung hacks of the 20th century, and can speed up your C++ hacking by an order of magnitude.  Oh and let's not forget ediff.

You might also find tabbar useful. It emulates the only behavior I missed when moving from Eclipse to Emacs. Bound to "," and "." for moving to the previous and next tab bar, it relives you from switching the buffer by Ctrl-x b all the time.

Unfortunately, the mentioned web page does not provide the correct version to download. Most Ubuntu versions, however, deliver it in their emacs-goodies packages.

I use emacs on Windows.  the compile module is nice, but I wanted compile to be smarter about the compile command line it suggests.  It's possible to use "File Variables" to specify compile-command, but I wanted something a little smarter than that. So I wrote a little function to help out. It guesses the compile command to use, to prompt the user with, when running compile. 

The guess function looks for a vbproj or csproj or sln file, and if found, it suggests msbuild.  Then it looks at the buffer file name, and depending on that, suggests different things.  A .wxs file means it's a WIX project, and you likely want to build an MSI, so the guess logic suggests an nmake command for the MSI.  If it's a Javascript module, then the suggestion is to run jslint-for-wsh.js to lint the .js file.  As a fallback, it suggests nmake. 

The code I use looks like this:

(defun cheeso-guess-compile-command ()
  "set `compile-command' intelligently depending on the
current buffer, or the contents of the current directory."
  (interactive)
  (set (make-local-variable 'compile-command)
       (cond
        ((or (file-expand-wildcards "*.csproj" t)
             (file-expand-wildcards "*.vcproj" t)
             (file-expand-wildcards "*.vbproj" t)
             (file-expand-wildcards "*.shfbproj" t)
             (file-expand-wildcards "*.sln" t))
         "msbuild ")

        ;; sometimes, not sure why, the buffer-file-name is
        ;; not set.  Can use it only if set.
        (buffer-file-name
         (let ((filename (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name)))
           (cond

            ;; editing a .wxs (WIX Soluition) file
            ((string-equal (substring buffer-file-name -4) ".wxs")
             (concat "nmake "
                     ;; (substring buffer-file-name 0 -4) ;; includes full path
                     (file-name-sans-extension filename)
                     ".msi" ))

            ;; a javascript file - run jslint
            ((string-equal (substring buffer-file-name -3) ".js")
             (concat (getenv "windir")
                     "\\system32\\cscript.exe c:\\users\\cheeso\\bin\\jslint-for-wsh.js "
                     filename))

            ;; something else - do a typical .exe build
            (t
             (concat "nmake "
                     (file-name-sans-extension filename)
                     ".exe")))))
        (t
         "nmake "))))


(defun cheeso-invoke-compile-interactively ()
  "fn to wrap the `compile' function.  This simply
checks to see if `compile-command' has been previously set, and
if not, invokes `cheeso-guess-compile-command' to set the value.
Then it invokes the `compile' function, interactively."
  (interactive)
  (cond
   ((not (boundp 'cheeso-local-compile-command-has-been-set))
    (cheeso-guess-compile-command)
    (set (make-local-variable 'cheeso-local-compile-command-has-been-set) t)))
  ;; local compile command has now been set
  (call-interactively 'compile))

;; in lieu of binding to `compile', bind to my monkeypatched function
(global-set-key "\C-x\C-e"  'cheeso-invoke-compile-interactively)


I tried doing this as "before advice" for the compile function but couldn't get it to work satisfactorily. So I defined a new function and bound it to the same keystroke combination I have been using for compile. 




  EDIT there is now "smarter-compile.el" which takes this idea one step further.

I know this is a very old post. But this question is valid for emacs beginners.

IMO the best way to use emacs as an ide is to use a language server protocol with emacs. You can find all the information about language servers in the linked website. 

For a quick setup, i would urge you to go to this page eglot . IMO eglot does it's job pretty well. It integrates well with auto completions packages like company. Provides find reference, and more. 

Also for a debugger, you may need specific debuggers for specific languages. You can use gdb from within emacs. Just type M-x gdb . 

For compiling your code, it's best to use shell-commands. I am working on this project eproj. It's gonna take a while to complete it. But all it does is maps shell command to project type. And builds you project via shell. It does the same to execute command. I may need help completing this project. It's not ready for use, but if you know a bit of elisp you can go through the code. 

That aside, it's always best to use the emacs compile command.

For version control, I haven't yet seen any other package which can match the power of magit. It's specific to git. Also for git there is another package git-timemachine, which i find very useful.

Object lookup and class lookup is provided by language server protocol. 

A project tree can be used for ide like interface with treemacs.

There is also a project Interaction Library called projectile.

For auto completion, I find company-mode very useful. 

Truly emacs can be made to do anything.
    
    
Answer 15: 

    
    
On documentation lookup: that depends on your programming language(s).

C libraries and system calls are typically documented in man pages.  For that you can use M-x man.  Some things may be documented better in info pages; use M-x info.

For elisp itself, use C-h f.  For python, use &gt;&gt;&gt; help(&lt;function, class, module&gt;) in the interpreter.

I find that most other languages offer documentation in html form.  For that, try an embedded browser (I use w3m).  Set your BROWSER environment variable to a wrapper script around emacsclient  -e "(w3m-goto-url-new-session \"$@\")" (on *nix), in case something might open a browser and you want it opened inside emacs.

In the Unix or X windows style, I don't know that there is an integrated IDE that works for everything. 

For interacting with debuggers, just one component of an IDE, consider realgud. The other thing it has that I find useful are parsers for location messages, so that if you have a call stack trace and want to edit at a particular place in the callstack, this front-end interface will can do that. 

By far this program could use improvement. But then it could also use people working on it to improve it.

Title: Can Eclipse refresh resources automatically?
Description: 
    
    
                    
Eclipse (3.4.2 with PyDev) deals with out-of-sync resources (files that have been edited outside of the IDE) differently from other IDEs that I've used, where only resources with editors open are considered out-of-sync.  In Eclipse, any resource can go out of sync.

This means that when I perform a search after any file has changed outside of Eclipse, I get an error dialog telling me that files are out of sync, even if they have no open editors.  As far as I can tell, there is no global refresh command, so I'm forced to read the project names (I have several projects) in the error dialog, and do a right-click + refresh for each of them.

I've checked the Refresh Automatically setting in Settings &gt; General &gt; Workspace, but this has no effect.  Is there any way to get Eclipse to always just load non-active resources from disk?
    

        
Answer 1: 

    
    
This issue will be fixed in Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo).  While "Refresh Automatically" does eventually bring resources back into sync, the refresh hook only exists for Windows, so on Linux and Mac OS it has to poll the filesystem periodically.

From 3.7 there's a new preference Settings &gt; General &gt; Workspace &gt; Refresh On Access (aka Lightweight Refresh).  This preference causes Eclipse to automatically refresh resources when it discovers that they're 'out-of-sync'.  When opening, reading or searching files, it'll prevent out-of-sync errors from occurring.

Answer 2: 

    
    
I think if you click on the project node in the Project Explorer and press F5 or right click and select Refresh, all resources for that project will be refreshed. Also, if you CTRL+click on multiple projects, you should be able to refresh multiple projects at the same time.

A single click on a project, a CTRL+A to select everything, and an F5 should do exactly what you need - refresh everything.

I'll have to test this when I get the chance, but I believe this is how I overcame similar problems in the past.



I've noticed that this answer routinely is getting down voted. I'd like to point out that the question refers to a specific version of Eclipse: 3.4.2. There was actually no automatic method to refresh out-of-sync resources until version 3.7 Indigo of Eclipse, as mentioned in James Blackburn's answer. The method described in this answer is the only method to achieve this in version 3.4.2 (and any other version before 3.7 Indigo).

A global refresh is really missing in Eclipse. The above procedure with selecting all projects and then running refresh (e.g. F5) does not work if you have closed projects included in your selection. This means, if you have 1/2 of your many projects closed as I do, you find yourself manually Ctrl-clicking through your dozens of projects. This is quite painful. I wish Eclipse would simply ignore closed projects.
    
    
Answer 9: 

    
    
The global refresh actually exists in plain Eclipse without any plugins and without selecting every project in your workspace.

Basically you need to deselect everything in your project explorer and hit F5. To do that Ctrl+click the selected resource in the project explorer and hit F5.
    
    
Answer 10: 

    
    
Yes, Refresh on Access is long overdue ... those answers to this and similar enquires usually suggested enabling the global auto-refresh, which could take an age for large remote projects.

I managed to solve this by creating a new "external tool" run config that executes a blank batch file. In the run config, you can have it refresh the workspace when complete. Then I created a macro using Practically Macro that 1) executes the last external tool run config (refreshing the workspace), then 2) executes the last debug run config (running my app). If you uncheck "Allocate console" then the completed external tool entry won't show up in the debug window.

I'm working on some applications that, in debug mode, log to the console. I'd like to run and debug them from inside of Eclipse, and view the console for each one simultaneously. However, I have a single Console tab that shows a single Console output at a time.

Answer 1: 

    
    
Yes, 


located near your console tab should be a button "Open Console".
If you click this button one of your options should be "New Console View".




You'll now have 2 console views.


One of your other buttons near your console tab is "Display Selected Console". When you choose this option you can select from any of your running applications. 
Just select the tab, select which application you want it to watch, and repeat for the other tab.


You can then move your 2 console views to wherever you want independently of each other.

I'm using Eclipse Helios Release with build ID: 20100617-1415.
    
    
Answer 2: 

    
    
The best thing you can do is the following.

Window &gt; New Window. 


That will create another eclipse window like you currently have. Run the desired application, switch the console on the new window to display the desired console output with open console button on the console view. 

A bit clunky but the only way to get multiple consoles at the same time. If your new windows doesn't have console open use 

Window &gt; Show View &gt; Console
