Have a php project with php file inside.
The php file contents is:
<?php
function test(){
}
?>
 
1.Right click at a project name in PHP Explorer view.
2.Go to Properties in context menu -> Builders.
3.Untick "Script builder" check box.
4.Press OK.
5.In Confirmation dialog press "OK" too.

Repeat steps 1-2 for the same project.


Expected:
Script builder stays unticked.

Actual:
A new ticked checkbox is appeared in Builders page, named "Script builder"
The old one unticked "Script builder" (the same name!!!) still exists.
