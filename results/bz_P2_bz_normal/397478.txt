I can reproduce this in WTP 3.5M4, but not in 3.4.2. I haven't tried earlier milestones to see when this problem appeared.

Create a JPA project with an eclipselink-orm.xml and a java file. Open the eclipselink-orm.xml and right-click on the structure view, you'll see the 'Add Class' option when right-clicking EntityMappings. Now open the java file and right click on something in the JPA Structure view. Switch back to the eclipselink-orm.xml file and right-click on EntityMappings in the JPA Structure view. The 'Add Class' option is not longer there any more. 'Remove Class', 'Map As', 'Add Attribute to XML' no longer appear on the Entity or attributes. The JPA Diagram Editor 'Open Diagram' is the only command that appears.

Interestingly, if you use the quick access you will see that those particular commands are active and you can use them from there, they just aren't appearing in the right-click menu.
