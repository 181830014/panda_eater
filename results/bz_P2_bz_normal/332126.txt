Build Identifier: 2.0.1

As discussed shortly in the following forum thread: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&th=201201, the default option of FlushClearCache (DropInvalidate) does not invalidate the entire remote cache. 

This should be changed, so that stale data does not occur just because of the usage of flush & clear.

Reproducible: Always
