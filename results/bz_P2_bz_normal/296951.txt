I installed ATF according to the following instruction.

I tried debug for JavaScript like in "Debug on server" for Java.
(It means that I don't set BreakePoints on deployed files but on local files.)

I have seen the demo movie "JavaScript Debugger". 
So I knew followin process.

Right click a html file -> debug in Mozilla -> "Defiine a New Server"...

However, I couldn't find "Defiine a New Server".
Debuger (its target is a "Project file") started automatically.

I cannot debug for JavaScript like in "Debug on server" for Java.
