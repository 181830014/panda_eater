Several issues were encountered in getting JPA SRG tests running in OSGi.

- weaving does not seem to work when launching Equinox using -jar
- <exclude-unlisted-classes>false</exclude-unlisted-classes> does not work, jar is unable to be found, this requires the classes to be listed, which is very tedidious, a workaround is to list the jar in the persistence unit, which seems to work.
- several imports are missing from the manifest

> I assume there are several others as well, depending on what features are used.  Different OSGi environments, or ways of launching seem to require different imports...

- variable 1-1 uses wrong class loader to init classes
- no error was logged if osgi init failed
- multiple persistence units in manifest did not work as spaces were not trimmed
