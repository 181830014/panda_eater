ReportQueryResult implementation of put is flawed as each ReportQueryResult in a collection of results shares the same names Collection. When put is called on the first row the new property is added to the names Collection and added to the results collection however on attempting put on subsequent rows 
getNames().indexOf(name) returns the index of the name and the following code throws IndexOutOfBoundsException
Object oldValue = getResults().get(index) because there is no value at that index in this instance of ReportQueryResult.
