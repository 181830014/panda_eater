I have attempted to get the JPA spec to remove the sequences from the orm.xml schema. I still don't know if they have removed them from the 2.0 schema.  I am hoping that eclipselink can go ahead and remove them from the eclipselink-orm.xml schema since there is no reason for them.  It makes life difficult for someone who is writing the xml themselves (though it does keep us tool developers in business :)).  

I noticed that some of the new items in the eclipselink-orm.xml schema aren't even in the same order.  Though now that I look closer I think the only thing out of order is the embeddable type.  Not sure if you can fix that, I think the only way is to remove the sequences, otherwise it would break backwards compatibility
