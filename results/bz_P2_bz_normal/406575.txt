John Peberdy has forked JSDT to fix many bugs and to add support for NJSDoc. The code can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/nexj/webtools.jsdt.core/overview. There is also an update site which can be used to install the feature + fixes here: https://bitbucket.org/nexj/updatesite/raw/default.

John has put a lot of work into fixing bugs and adding this new feature, we should review the code to potentially merge it back into JSDT.
