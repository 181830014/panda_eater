a field annotated with @Lob is mapped to the original datatype for this javatype (e.g. String to varchar) instead of clob. The same thing for byte[] to
binary / blob. 
So one can not configure with @Lob if byte[] results in a blob or a meaningful type (binary) that can be used in QL (e.g. max, distinct, in, ...)
