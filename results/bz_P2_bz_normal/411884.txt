I often disable some project's repo or features in order to get a green build. Something I do often. While I always make a commit in git commit about it, I do not always open bugs or send emails ... there would be far too many ... and projects simply re-enable once the issue is fixed and they are ready to re-contribute. 

And, I normally check occasionally to see if anyone is "disabled" and if something does not look right, will try to re-enable, or send note to cross-project, etc. 

But, something broke down during the hectic final weeks of Kepler and one feature was disabled, and then never re-enabled, even though it (probably) could have been. My apologies to Riena project. 

One thing that might help avoid such oversights in future, is a "repo report" that lists b3aggrcon files that have disabled contributions, repositories, or features. The list should normally have none in it, when we are ready to release a milestone or release, but would not be that uncommon in the middle of a milestone or during "warmup" builds as teams have to re-build to fit in to the constraints of their dependencies.
