To reproduce:
* Simply put "&#0;" character in Mylyn xml file for a task. 
* Start Eclipse.
* Try to open the task in an editor.

"&#0;" is not a valid xml character so the failure is somehow justified but Mylyn allows to write it to xml file and that is a real issue. 

Mylyn should not allow to write null characters and one of the places where the protection could happen is TaskDataStateWriter.
