When executing a query which has had setMaxResults set on it, sql column names are
aliased and when the column name is embedded in quotes (e.g. @Column(name = "\"NAME\"")) the alias will contain also the quotes, causing the ORA-00923 error.

Exceuting the JPQL: SELECT entity FROM X1 entity results in

Internal Exception: java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: ORA-00923: FROM keyword not found where expected

Error Code: 923
