Calling new PersistenceProvider().createEntityManagerFactory("puName",somePropertiesWithWrongUserNameOrPassword).createEntityManager(); fails with a javax.persistence.PersistenceException --> org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.DatabaseException --> "java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver - 08001" if the given username or password is wrong. There is currently no way to retrieve the real reason for the failed database connection, e.g. to communicate this problem to the user who has just entered the username and/or password.
