It is difficult for site visitors to understand what COSMOS provides and where it is today.  Much of the information is not well organized or is just simply outdated.  As a starter, we should provide different content for the "What is COSMOS?" link found on the main COSMOS site.  We could include more links in that box for more advanced topics.

In order to build interest in the project, we need a clear and attractive presentation on our site.  IMO, this should be prioritized for the near term, based on frequent comments we heard at EclipseCon of this nature.
