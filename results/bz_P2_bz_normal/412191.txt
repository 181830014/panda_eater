Query query = EntitiManager.createQuery("SELECT c FROM ContactHO WHERE c.companyId = :companyId ORDER BY c.firstNameNorm, c.lastNameNorm ASC");

The EclipseLink debug looks fine:

CONTACTHO.COMPANYID => 5893435701058912613
$sort => DatabaseRecord(
CONTACTHO.LASTNAME => 1
CONTACTHO.FIRSTNAME => 1))]

but the the resulting sort order is mixed up:

Thu Jun 27 19:24:54.186 [conn21] runQuery called siba.CONTACTHO { $query: { COMPANYID: 5894184253551005013 }, $orderby: { LASTNAMENORM: 1, FIRSTNAMENORM: 1 } }

DataBaseRecord preserves ordering by using Vector's for fields and values, which MongoRecord does not care for, its just a HashMap and fields get "ordered" by their hashCode.

MongoRecord hasnt changed in latest 2.5.1 or 2.6 releases/snapshots, so probably this problem still exists in these versions as well.
