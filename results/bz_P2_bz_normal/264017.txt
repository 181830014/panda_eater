Currently upon changes to properties of a TaskRepository, a notification is fired to all IRepositoryListener. The listeners are only passed the new TaskRepository object instead and not informed of what property has changed (i.e. property, old value, new value). This is problematic and resulting in construction of new clients all too frequently (i.e. after each repository synchronization due to setting of the repository sync timestamp).
