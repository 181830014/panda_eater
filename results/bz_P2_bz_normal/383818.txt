From post http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/357791/
when creating a XMLEntityMappings to return from a MetadataSource there are a number of exceptions that occur when the lists are not initilized.  This occurs because these lists get initialized through orm.xml processing, and null checks were just never needed/added before.  

This needs to be changed to make XMLEntityMappings easier to use and define mappings directly.
