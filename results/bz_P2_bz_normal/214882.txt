Eclipse log

env:
jdk 1.6.0_02
Eclipse 3.3.1.1
Trac 0.10.4 (tracd standalone, tried with --auth and --basic-auth)
Using XML-RPC for the mylyn trac connector.

When opening a ticket with 1000+ comments Eclipse first hangs for ~15+ minutes and then crashes. I can open other tickets without problems.

stderr output:
The program 'Eclipse' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 377387 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
