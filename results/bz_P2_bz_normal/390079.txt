EclipseLink fails using sequences which return a value < allocationSize
This issue has been reported already in 2009 and it's still not fixed:

This situation is quite common: You have a new sequence which will return 1 as its initial value and use an incrementBy greater than 1.
EclipseLink is not able to deal with this situation although it could be fixed easily.
