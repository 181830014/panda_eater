Build a JPA project w/ orm.xml referencing a class that is in one of:
- another project
- a workspace or external jar
- a library (user, web, ear, etc.)

UI is populated correctly and validation returns no errors.

Remove external class from classpath, rebuild project, update and validate orm.xml.  The class is still validated as resolved and has proper old settings, though the class is no longer available.
