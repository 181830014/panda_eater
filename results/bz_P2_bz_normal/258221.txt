I can't bind NULL as a parameter when compared to an Integer field.

Exception [EclipseLink-4002] (Eclipse Persistence Services - 1.0.1 (Build 20080905)): org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.DatabaseException
Internal Exception: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: operator does not exist: integer = character varying
Error Code: 0
Call: SELECT date, monthly_period, weekly_period, collation, dow, price, adjusted_price, volume, market_cap, lt_collation, security_serial_id, matlab_date FROM raw_price WHERE (security_serial_id = ?) ORDER BY security_serial_id DESC, matlab_date DESC
        bind => [null]

The failure is right after my code

   rawPriceQuery.setParameter("secID", (Integer) null);

and the named Query involved is

        @NamedQuery(
            name = "RawPrice.selectForPrice",
            query =
                "SELECT r FROM RawPrice r WHERE r.rawPricePK.securitySerialId= :secID" +
                " ORDER BY r.rawPricePK.securitySerialId DESC, r.rawPricePK.matlabDate DESC"
        )

security_serial_id is an integer field.
  
TopLink does not complain and behaves as expected.
If I replace the (Integer)null with an integer constant, EclipseLink
does not complain and behaves as expected.
