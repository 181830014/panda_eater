On Windows 2K, Japanese OS, try to create GMF Text/note and enter japanese characters "&#20998;&#26512;&#12392;&#35373;&#35336;", it comes back square boxes.

If you override TextEditPart, NoteEditPart to use this font "\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30ed\u30b0", it works but default font which text/note uses doesn't work for japanese characters.

Problem only happens on Japanese OS Win2k. It works fine for Japanese OS WinXP, Win2003 etc.
