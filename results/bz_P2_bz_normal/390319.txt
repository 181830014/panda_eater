Actually the main intended way of tweaking of the generated diagram code is the using of the @generated NOT tags for custom code. 

Additionally there is a way of using GMF-Runtime providers extension points for replacing the big chunks of the generated functionality, but experience shows that it is too high level and allows to replace/tweak only big chunks of the generated functionality. 

While GMFT recognizes @generated NOT as a sometimes inevitable escape for toolsmith, we should consider using the DI-based way of the customization targeting complete separation between the generated and customized code, similar to how it is done in XText.
