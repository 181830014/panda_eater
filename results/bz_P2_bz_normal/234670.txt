Currently there is a problem with Platform visibility in new project creation.  The Combo doesn't do a good job of presenting the various options, and as a result, a given platform selection might be made when a more appropriate platform was available but not seen by the user.

The platform options should be presented in a single selection list, which would do a much better job at displaying the possible options.
