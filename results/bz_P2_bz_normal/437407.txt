We've observed an issue with connectors that implement Dates and DateTimes in UTC and convert those Dates back to local time for display. When dealing with Dates with no hour which are typically stored on the server in UTC, no conversion to local time is necessary or desired. DateAttributeEditor is applying a date formatter with the default timezone, therefore rolling the day back (or rolling it forward in some locales, I suppose).
