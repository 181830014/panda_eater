Using a superclass with InheritanceType.Joined, then a subclass with InheritanceType.SingleTable, then in the next subclass when you try to use an Embedded class, JPA puts all it's attributes into the first class (the one with the InheritanceType.Joined).



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Here an example of what i'm trying to say:

@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)
public class Person {
 // attributes and methods...
}

@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
public class User extends Person {
 // attributes and methods...
}

public class MainUser extends User {

    @Embedded
    Address adress;

}

@Embeddable
public class Adress {

  private String street;

  private int number;  

}


Instead of putting Adress attributes (street and number) in the User table that is SINGLE_TABLE, it puts on the Person table.
