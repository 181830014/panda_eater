Structure of XML and JSON entities are inconsistent.  When an entity has no relationships the generated XML does not include an empty element while an empty array is generated in JSON.  An entity with no relationships should not generate a "_relationships" attribute.

<employee>
   <addressId>0</addressId>
   <firstName>Shaun</firstName>
   <id>3</id>
   <lastName>Smith</lastName>
</employee>

{
  "addressId": 0,
  "firstName": "Shaun",
  "id": 3,
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "_relationships": []
}
