When joining via a condition using the JOIN-ON syntax the query parser gives an error:  "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Bad Query" if the first condition after the WHERE is from the joined class rather than the selected class.

Example 1:  This query works:

select distinct r
from JpaRole r
join JpaRoleAction xref on (r.id=xref.roleId)
where (  
    r.id > 0 
 and xref.actionId = 21673
 )

Example 2:  This query does not work:

select distinct r
from JpaRole r
join JpaRoleAction xref on (r.id=xref.roleId)
where (  
    xref.actionId = 21673
    and r.id > 0
 )


Example 3:  This query does not work:

select distinct r
from JpaRole r
join JpaRoleAction xref on (r.id=xref.roleId)
where (  
    xref.actionId = 21673
 )
