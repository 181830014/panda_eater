I have to entities "Employee" that have a set of projects. Projects are loaded lazily.

I atempt top copy the projects from one employee to another:

Employee hans = em.find(Employee.class, HANS_ID);
Employee fred = em.find(Employee.class, FRED_ID);
fred.setProjects(hans.getProjects());
em.getTransaction().commit();

Upon commit, eclipselink does not reflect the change on the database. I assume the change is ignored as hans.getProjects() was a pending collection before the change and is a pending pending collection after the change. But EclipseLink should detect that the owner of the pending collection has changed.

The issue is reproduced by test 

org.eclipse.persistence.testing.tests.wdf.jpa1.relation.TestBidirectionalManyToMany 

in the eclipselink.jpa.wdf.testsuite.
