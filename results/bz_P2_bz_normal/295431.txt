If i use inheritance i can map an attribut only in a super class.
Eg. SuperClass AClass 
         Attribute aAttribute
    Class B extends AClass
Mapping
	descriptor.getInheritancePolicy().setParentClass(AClass.class);

If i make a query to uow, QueryKeyExpression.valuesFromCollection is called and
for bug 2780817  the mapping is assigned to the mapping of the subclass.
But this mapping does not exists. 
A NullpointerException is the  effect 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make a class structure like described

2. Set the mapping only in the super class. Set in 
   subclass the setParantClass method with the superClass as parameter
   Make a third class which has Class B as Referenz =referenceb. 
    Class ThirdClass
       B referenceb;
3. Open a uow; Make a ReadAllQuery againts the third class and set 
   an Expression 
   Expression exp = eb.get("referenceb").equal(objectB);

   where obejctB is an Object of ClassB 
   Than the error occurs.
