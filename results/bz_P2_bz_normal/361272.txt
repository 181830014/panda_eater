In running clustering tests, I found that cache coordination failed to work is a logged out and back in to one of the sessions.

After debugging, I have no idea why, but it always occurred.  It seems one of the servers would no longer talk to the other 2.  Must have been something in the shutdown and the reconnect that somehow disconnected it from the other servers.
