Using Eclipselink Version 2.4.0.v20111118-r10419

Given this example EclipseLink gives the following incorrect warning:
@Entity
@Multitenant(value=MultitenantType.SINGLE_TABLE)
@TenantDiscriminatorColumn(name="TENANT_ID", primaryKey=true)
public class Foo {
    @Id
    private int id;
}

[EL Warning]: ejb_or_metadata: You have specified multiple ids for the entity class [model.Foo] without specifying an @IdClass. By doing this you may lose the ability to find by identity, distributed cache support etc. Note: You may however use entity manager find operations by passing a list of primary key fields. Else, you will have to use JPQL queries to read your entities. For other id options see @PrimaryKey.
