If  connector returns false on canCreateTaskFromKey, the task key field is disabled in the Task Search page.

However if one uses the "Search repository key or summary" action in the task list, that field gets auto-populated even though it's disabled, and in turn disabling the rest of the search page.
Usually hitting the clear button (or, in Leo's case, switching repositories) can resolve the state of disablement, but I think that it the field is disabled, it shouldn't even get the task key from the task list in the first place
