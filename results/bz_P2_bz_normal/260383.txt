By default we lookup the datasource in JNDI using a composite name, which does not work on several (tomcat, jboss, geronimo, was?, most?) environments.  We should instead default to looking up using string (assuming it works in everything, need to test wls, glassfish, oc4j, was).  If it does not work in everything, then the serverplatform should auto set the lookup type.

We should also make configuring the lookup type easier from jpa.
