test case:  caseTypeTest


"SELECT case e.firstName when 'Bob' then 1 when 'Jill' then 2 else 0 end + 1 FROM Employee e"; 

is converted into

SELECT (CASE t0.F_NAME WHEN 'Bob' THEN '1' WHEN 'Jill' THEN '2' ELSE '0' END + 1) FROM CMP3_EMPLOYEE t0, CMP3_SALARY t1 WHERE (t1.EMP_ID = t0.EMP_ID); 

where three of the four “Integer”s were converted into “String”, but the last one was not. So we ended up with and addition between String and Integer.
Quotations are added to the three “Integers” because the table definition of t0.F_NAME is VARCHAR.

Because Symfoware does not support implicit type conversion, so adding an integer to a string will be illegal.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.setup Symfoware database server 10.0
2.configure jdbc driver of Symfoware
3.run test-lrg in the jpa/eclipselink.jpa.test directory
