The CBI build for the Eclipse platform downloads software from places like oss.sonatype.org.

To comply with Eclipse Foundation IP policies and to ensure we can build the software far into the future as part of the long term support program, builds should pull from Foundation controlled sources like orbit, downloads.eclipse.org, maven.eclipse.org, and so forth.

This ticket tracks discussion and work for the Eclipse platform. Some of the work will be reusable for other projects.
