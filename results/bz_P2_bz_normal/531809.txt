I'd like to move the incubation mailing list link.

The incubation mailing list is really intended for committers and project leads. It's really not for community members that visit the page.

If anything, we should show a link to the project's dev list: "here's how you communicate with the project", but that information is already on the "Contact Us" page.

The link to the incubation mailing list already exists in the "Committer Tools" block, which is where I think it belongs.
