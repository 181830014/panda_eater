update-site
3.5
2.5
1.0.1/stable

Some of these look like project specific errors, but the point of this cross-project bug is that there is no common pattern. 

So, first of all, it looks pretty unprofessional, and hardly "coordinated". 

Second, there's an issue of if it _should_ be version specific or if there should just be one URL per project, and that one URL give access to any available updates? 

I'm not sure of the right answer, but wanted to open this bug for comment and suggestions so we can do better for Helios.
