Build Identifier: 2.3.0.v20110604-r9504

We're getting a ValidationError during deployment due to trying to use an empty string with an object type converter.

This is the entry in our orm.xml:

<object-type-converter name="tf-boolean-converter" object-type="java.lang.Boolean" data-type="java.lang.String">
    <conversion-value object-value="True" data-value="T" />
    <conversion-value object-value="False" data-value="F" />
    <conversion-value object-value="False" data-value="" />
</object-type-converter>

We get the following error:

Internal Exception: Exception [EclipseLink-7257] (Eclipse Persistence Services - 2.3.0.v20110604-r9504): org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.ValidationException
Exception Description: Unable to instantiate data value with type [class java.lang.String] and value [null] from the object type converter named [boolean-converter]


It could be that this is expected behavior but it would be nice if it at least converted to null for nullable types.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Include the object type converter in an entity mapping file. 
2. Tell persistence unit to use that mapping file
3. Attempt to deploy
