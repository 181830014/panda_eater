Steps To Reproduce:
1. Open the project's Build Path properties page.
2. Ensure the project's folder is selected as the Build Path root.
3. Click Add Folder.
4. Select a folder and click Finish.
This will result in a nesting conflict.

The nesting options from the Link Source dialog (Replace existing project source folder.. / Update exclusion filters.. / Ignore nesting conflicts..) should be added to the Add folder dialog. And the Update exclusion filters option should be selected by default.
