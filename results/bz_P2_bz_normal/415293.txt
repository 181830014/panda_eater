Not sure how to best describe this. But ever since I updated to the latest Gerrit 2.0.1, I feel that the user experience got quite a bit worse in regards to synchronization.
Examples are that very often(especially when network bandwith and/or ping are bad) I see:
* reviews are stuck in italic in the task list
* when I open a review that has an incoming, I end up with old data in the task editor and a second or two later a warning message in the task editor to refresh with new incomings
* fetching patchset information is slow / delayed which breaks / delays the workflow I had before significantly
* fetching fails when some background operation still happens (but there is no indication to the user that it will fail now or something else is going on).

Now I don't know what the reasons are, but I do know I did not have these problems with the previous released version (I think it was 1.something, unsure, but it didn't have the fancy images for votes). In general, that old version felt as if it was snappier and could be used more fluently. Almost as if it would cache more data offline.

I assume for all or some of the issues bugs already exists, but I figured the project members will have a better chance aligning those existing bugs with this report rather than me making assumptions.

In any case, if it's a decision on amount of data retrieved during querying vs. during opening a task editor, I'd always favor "retrieve as much as possible during querying (ideally partial taskData and getTaskData) so that there can be as close to full offline support as possible. Seeing a synchronized task with incomings in my task list should actually never need to contact the server when I open the task, this somewhat defeats the whole querying and task list thing in the first place.
