Debugging and launching should not allow or at least warn when an XSLT 2.0 stylesheet is being run against an XSLT 1.0 processor (i.e. Xalan).   Maybe the extension point needs to have a XSLT version attribute that indicates what the max version it supports.

I ran into an issue where I wasn't getting output I expected due to launching an XSLT 2.0 stylesheet in Xalan.
