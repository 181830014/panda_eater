This issue is filled as http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-16220

Attached is a test case that reproduces the issue. The root cause of the issue is ReportQuery.buildObjects has following code that ignores  RESULT_IGNORE returned from buildObject.  RESULT_IGNORE is defined as Boolean.TRUE and hence rows returning true are not returned to user.


        for (int index = 0; index < size; index++) {
            // GF_ISSUE_395
            Object result = buildObject((AbstractRecord)rows.get(index), rows);
            if (result != RESULT_IGNORED) {
                containerPolicy.addInto(result, reportResults, this.session);
            }
            //end GF_ISSUE
        }
