1. Select a directory name "foo"
2. Copy that directory into another project with a directory called "foo"
3. A requester is shown asking if you want to "skip", "skip all" or "cancel".
  
Try the same with a file.

It puts up a requester with an overwrite all option, which I'd like to see for
directories as well.
