Currently AJDT shows cross-cutting based on the aspect that defines the advice 
(which may be abstract) rather than the (concrete) aspect that implements it. 
This is misleading. The attached projects show 2 examples where this is 
problematic.

Example 1:

Project1 defines an abstract aspect which is extended and made concrete in 
Project2. The Editor view for project2.HelloWorld attributes cross-cutting to 
the abstract aspect but neither the Outline view for the abstract nor the 
concrete aspects shows any cross-cutting. The Visualiser views are empty.

Example 2:

Project3 defines an abstract aspect and 2 concrete sub-aspects. All views 
attribute the cross-cutting of project3.HelloWorld to the abstract aspect and 
misleadingly hide the duplicate advice in the 2 concrete sub-aspects.

In each example cross-cutting should be attributed to concrete aspects and all 
concrete aspects should appear in the Visualiser.
