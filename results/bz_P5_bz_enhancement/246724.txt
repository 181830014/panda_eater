The WorkLogPlugin from http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/WorkLogPlugin provides a Start/Stop work button above the attributes section.
It would be nice if this button could be added to the rich editor.

For the moment, I have to go to the web page to use the work log feature.

Further enhancement:

Integrate Activate/Deactivate task with the start/stop work feature.
