If I closed all the perspectives on the workbench, and installed a Hello World 
application that would add a menu item to the menu bar. The workbench is not 
updated with the new menu item until I opened a perspective.

Maybe a separate bug, at the end of the application install, the install will 
prompt for user to reset perspective even when all the perspectives were 
closed.
