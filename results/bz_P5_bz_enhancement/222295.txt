JPA inheritance doesn't have a way to specify if reading an intermidiate class should return subclasses or just the base class.  Eclipselink InheritancePolicy has a shouldReadSubclasses flag to turn off reading of subclasses and options to allow using joins or views for queries which are not currently supported in the EclipseLink-ORM.XML Schema.
