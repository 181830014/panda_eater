Diagram elements may not map directly to domain model elements, but rather be a 
derived value of some expression or query. For example, a hierarchical or flat 
view representation of a UML class as defined in "The UML Profile for Framework 
Architectures" requires information from an entire class hierarchy for 
representation on a diagram.
