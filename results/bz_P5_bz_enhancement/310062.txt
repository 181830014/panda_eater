Hi,

It would be very interesting to have a customization named "Expand all" allowing to expand all instances of meta class by default.

There is a scenario:
     - I want to expand all instances of my meta class "AA" by default.
     - So i create a new customization on my meta class "AA"

Best regards,

Nicolas Payneau
