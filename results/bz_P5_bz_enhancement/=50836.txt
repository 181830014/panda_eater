We have several bug reports that jdt deletes files when changing the class path.
The build path wizard should warn about this, but to do this correctly, we need
support from core.
The request is to get an API that tells me if and which files would be scrupped
after changing the build path.

Releated to that is to get information which files and folders get obsolete
after a class path change (e.g. old class files). Here we have the same problem
that we are very unprecice as analysing the classpath settings (output location
/ source folder combinations, source folder specific output locations) is difficult.
