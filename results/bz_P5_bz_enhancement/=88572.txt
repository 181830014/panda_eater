Currently "Refresh" action (F5 in package explorer and navigator views) show a
modal progress dialog untill refresh is complated. With a large workspace it
usually takes long time and all user operations are blocked during refresh.
Since "autorefresh" is not acceptable for a large workspace this issue is quite
critical.
