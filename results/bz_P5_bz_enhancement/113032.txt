If a signature specifies a known method with a wrong return type for the 
signature that's definitely worth an Xlint warning. E.g., this program compiles 
without a complaint then produces no output. Change the void to boolean for the 
signature in the call pointcut and it works. This should produce a compiler 
warning by default...

public aspect WarnOnWrongReturn {
    before(Thread hook) : call(void Runtime.removeShutdownHook(*)) && args
(hook) {
         System.out.println("removing");
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
	Thread thread = new Thread();
	Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(thread);
	Runtime.getRuntime().removeShutdownHook(thread);
    }
}
