I have several tast tags defined in my work space:
//TODO <-- has to be done before release!
//PERFORMANCE <-- if looking for performance improvement, come look here first
//REDESIGN <-- look for refactoring here first
etc.

I'd like the editor to help me complete these tags when I type them after the 
comment:
//T<ctrl+space> should propose me TODO
