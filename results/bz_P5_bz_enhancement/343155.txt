We have an existing Java benchmark (org.eclipse.gmt.modisco.java.discoverer.benchmark), but since it tries to measure both execution time and memory use, it regularly calls the GC before measuring instantaneous memory use, and so it ends up degrading performance severely.

So, we need a new Java discoverer benchmark that primarily measures execution time.
