Hi, I've been supplied with some Javadoc taglets, that define new tags such as
@post, @pre and others.  I was able to get Javadoc to use them by entering the
line  -taglet ipsdoc.Install -tagletpath "{path_to_my_workspace}/IPSTaglets/bin"
-link http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api
in Project -> Generate Javadoc -> next -> next -> VM Options, which gives the
results you can admire on
http://www.student.kuleuven.ac.be/~s0165897/umlImplementation%20docs/, and I put
the taglets themselves at http://www.student.kuleuven.ac.be/~s0165897/IPSTaglets/.
Now the problem is: if I have some comments like this:
    /**
     * Check whether this model element can have the given visibility as 
     * visibility [raw].
     * 
     * @param 	visibility
     * 			The visibility to check.
     * @return	False if the visibility is not effective.
     * 		| if ( visibility == null )
     * 		| then result == false
     * @return	True if the visibility is public.
     * 		| if ( visibility == Visibility.PUBLIC )
     * 		| then result == true
     */
and I do autoformat (C+S+F), I get something like this:
    /**
     * Check whether this model element can have the given visibility as
     * visibility [raw].
     * @param visibility The visibility to check.
     * @return False if the visibility is not effective. | if ( visibility ==
     * null ) | then result == false
     * @return True if the visibility is public. | if ( visibility ==
     * Visibility.PUBLIC ) | then result == true
     */
which is of course not what I want.  So what I expect is for Eclipse to
automatically apply the taglets and recognise the new tags.
Don't know whether this is possible though :-(
My workaround is to disable comment formatting altogether, but that's not
desirable either.

Cheers, H.
