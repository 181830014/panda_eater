Hi,

When creating a new Java Model Query in a query set, it could be usefull to have a selection window in the properties view to choose the Implementation Class Name, instead of copy pasting or typing it, which can lead to errors.

Or an alternative solution would be to add the same combo box as for the "Return Type".

Could that be possible ?

Regards

Nicolas
