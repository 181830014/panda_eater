When creating new tasks with a stack trace I'm able to search for duplicates in a task repository (using stack trace as so called detector). If found, a list of potential duplicates will be presented. What I'm missing here is a way to compare the stack trace from the new bug with the one selected from the Task Search list.

My suggestion is to add a context menu entry for the task search result list (but only when searching for a duplicates basing on the stack trace) which when clicked would open the compare editor/dialog. The compare editor could be extended with ability to ignore line numbers/package changes if needed.

This could help me to identify if the task found is a duplicated indeed.

I would be happy to help, actually I've been thinking about providing the patch itself. Just let me know if it sounds like a reasonable enhancement to you.
