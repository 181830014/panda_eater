I recently had a situation where I wanted to view a co-worker's code staging 
area and compare it with mine, so I created a linked folder to point to it. 
Everything worked fine until I almost started modifying his code by accident. 
I don't have control over the target's file permissions but I want control 
over my usage of the target. So I'm asking for an option that, when a linked 
resource or folder is created, I can tell Eclipse that this is read only even 
if the file permissions would normally allow writes. That way Eclipse can 
prevent accidental modifications to that resource or any files under that 
folder. Modifications would include editing, renaming, and deleting. Since 
this is an enhancement request, post 3.0 is fine if you want to 'Later' it.
