When an RCP application (or even the Eclipse IDE itself) is started for the 
first time, the window position is such that the app window extends past the 
screen's display area (if the app window's size is close to the size of the 
screen).  There seems to be no way to change the default starting location of 
the application window.

An implementation of IWorkbenchWindowConfigurer.setInitialPosition(...) would be 
great - it would allow an RCP application to set the default window position in 
the WorkbenchAdvisor.preWindowOpen(...) method, along with the default window 
size.
