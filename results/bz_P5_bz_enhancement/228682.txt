When in the database platform classes a gateway method returns true, e.g. supportsSequenceObjects, then other methods must be implemented. If they are not, the coder can get arbitrary exceptions, like NPE's, from anywhere in the code. 

It would be better to have the stub methods in org.eclipse.persistence.internal.databaseaccess.DatabasePlatform throw an "not implemented" exception, so the coder knows immediately what to do.
