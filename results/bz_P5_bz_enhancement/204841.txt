When query export file is dragged to the Task List view from local folder its query is automatically imported to the Task List. However if you drag that file from the link on the web page, it will create web task linked with the dragged link. I think it should also import query.

See for example http://wiki.eclipse.org/Bug_Day_September_2007#Projects
