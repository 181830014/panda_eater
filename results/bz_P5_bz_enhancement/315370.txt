Hi,

When I create a FacetSet, I would found very handy that each time I create a new child (Right Click -> New Child -> Facet/Facet Att/Facet Ref etc ..) the focus is set to the properties view, ready to type the name of the child. 

It would be like creating a new file, you could start typing the name as soon as you create a facet.

Regards

Nicolas
