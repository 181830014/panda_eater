When working on bug 109980, we should consider the following optimization.
Considering the following code:
C c;
if (....) {
  c = new C1();
} else {
  c = new C2();
}
// code when c is never used
....

C1 extends C and C2 extends C. When merging the two stack maps entries at the
end of the if statement, we might want to put Top on the top of stack instead of
C. This could prevent the VM from loading many classes in order to find out if
the merge is fine.
This needs to be investigated regarding the VM specs in order to find out if it
is legal to do it.
If legal, it might be worth it to implement it.
