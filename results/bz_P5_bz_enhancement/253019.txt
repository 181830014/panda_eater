As a result of a code review for bug# 248748 on where WebLogic specific functionality was added to MBean services on 20081031

See

Refactor:
---------
From D.M.

Human readable time format for TimeConnectionEstablished.
Currently the time shows as 1224775836712 (an encoded date/time format)

Propose we add a 2nd field and construct a date (or timestamp???) with the long value and return String.valueOf() - the date/timestamp.
