when a new untitled document is opened and the user adds:

package a.b;

class Widget {

}

When the "save as" button is selected,  the code should be automatically 
anlyzed and a pop-up suggesting "save as a/b/Widget.java and add source 
structure to project?" should be displayed.  Upon answering yes, the source 
folder structure a/b should be automatically generated AND added to the project 
and the file should be saved as a/b/Widget.java.   All at the touch of a single 
defualt option.  This is what most top level IDE's have.  This would save the 
developer boatloads of time!
