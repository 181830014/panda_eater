Currently, there are only two options to run ajc on binary files, either a jar
file or a directory.  Sometimes I need to run ajc on a single binary file in a
directory, but since that directory have other files, ajc will apply the other
files too.  If there is a option to run ajc on a single binary file, it will be
very useful.
