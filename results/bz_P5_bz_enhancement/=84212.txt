Deleting a large project UI feedback issues.
Version 3.1.m4

This is a three-parter.

1) I am deleting a huge project (a CVS checkout of all of Apache Jakarta
Commons), including deleting the files on disk. Once initiated, it took about a
minute for the progress dialog to display. 

2) Once displayed, the progress bar is "stuck" on "Deleting: /MyProjectName",
which is not much progress. 

3) I cannot send the job to the background.

Thanks,
Gary
