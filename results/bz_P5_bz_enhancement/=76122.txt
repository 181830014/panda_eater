A filter can be as dynamic as a content provider.  Currently, ContentProvider 
has a dispose method, but filters do not.  The workaround is to hook the 
Control's dispose method, AND to check to see if the filter is active before 
telling the viewer to refresh.

It would be easier if the viewer disposed the filter when:
1) The filter was no longer active
2) The viewer is disposed
