It would be nice to keep the sent reports locally, at least for some time (thinking about a mechanism like a rolling appender for a logger).

Current use-case: I report an error which is caused by a third-party plugin with a separate bugtracker.
This returns me the message, that the error is not-eclipse.
The bug-report ist not accessible for me so i have no way to access the previous stacktrace to report it manually somewhere else.

This can be integrated in a new view, e.g. like the Bookmarks-View, where the user can select the last X sent reports which brings up the details-section of the reporting-dialog again.
