mns allows to sort columns by name, but using this action, I find it is not always enough for the user.
Sometimes, you want hide all feature which comes from the same meta-model, or all the features which comes from the same element.
I think it could be interesting to use a TreeViewer for this dialog. This TreeViewer will allow to regroup the columns by meta-model (UML, Ecore, FacetSet, ...), and maybe by element (EObject, EClass, EPackage, ...).
This TreeViewer would be fully expanded when the dialog is open. A double click on a node will allow to expand/collapse the selected node.

If a such dialog is not possible, maybe could we add an icon to each object in the list, in order to distinguish more easily the metamodel owning the feature.
