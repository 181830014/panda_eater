One of our testers tried exporting a zip out of eclipse using the Export -> Zip
file wizard, and they typed in a file name without the full path (e.g.
"myfile.zip"), exported, but then they couldn't find the file because they
didn't know where it went. Perhaps it would help to have some means of knowing
just by looking at the dialog where it will go if the user types in a relative
path such as just a file name.
