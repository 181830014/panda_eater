Not sure if this isn't already there, bu anyways. Please investigate if it will be a good
idea to show additional relevant info on Active Search view within given landmark scoope
(e.g. inside class or method). For example:

-- TODO/tasks and warning/error markers
--
Breakpoints and bookmarks
-- Markers from other tools (AJDT markers, FindBugs, PMD, Simian
markers)

It seems that all of the above are represented by editor markers, so maybe
they can be used directly and Active Search could just show all the markers. For those
things that are not represented by markers Mylar can probably contribute some (not shown
in editor) and also allow user to choose what marker types to show in Active Search view.
