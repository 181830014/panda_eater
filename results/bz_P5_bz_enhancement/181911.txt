More information:
Bugzilla now supports Time Tracking (Mylar already supports this in the rich editor). It would be great if one could (optionally) combine Mylar's and Bugzilla's Time Tracking and, e.g., automatically add elapsed time from Mylar to the related Bugzilla bug. Or get a deadline from a Bugzilla bug and use it in the Mylar Task.
