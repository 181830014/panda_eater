Have the ability to do live updating of the chart's plot area.  Here is one 
scenario:
An web page contains a chart to track real-time stock qoutes for a particular 
stock.  As time passes the chart refelcts the change in value of the stock.  

The refresh time interval should be configurable.   In a web environment it 
should be possible to only refresh the chart.  If the chart is rendererd in SVG 
only the plot area section should be changed.
