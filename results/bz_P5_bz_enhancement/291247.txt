With my workflow I am running multiple instances of eclipse on different workspaces all the time. Normally like 4 eclipses running at the same time on average. Each one would pull its queries from bugzilla independently multiplying the load on the server. Well, in my case I figured to disable synchronization except my main session running a query manually when I really need it. But as subject asks:

Is it possible to optimize fetching queries for multiple instances of eclipse running? Maybe it would make sense to use one common repository for Mylyn tasks and have the location configurable? Not that it is of much importance to me but it was suggested that ideas are welcome here.
