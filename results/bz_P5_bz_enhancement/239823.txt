Report queries represent a special challenge for default redirection.  When a JPQL query returns multiple entities a ReportQuery will be built and executed by EclipseLink.  Because two different classes are being returned it is very difficult to determine which Entity descriptor should be considered to be the main one for redirection.

A strategy must be developed and implemented for this scenario.
