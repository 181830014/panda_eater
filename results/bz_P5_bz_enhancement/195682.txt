Large CVS repositories, such as dev.eclipse.org/cvsroot/tools, can be a pain to browse due to all the scrolling.  As such, repository browsing views are a good candidate for focus.  We have not added focus to them yet because repository browsing typically involves a broader context than that of a single task.  For example, when committers are working on Mylyn they want quick access to all the Mylyn projects.  Instead of focusing on the task context alone we could focus the view instead on a global workspace context or a working set specific context.  We already have some rudimentarly support for such global contexts, and this could be a good driver for improving them.
