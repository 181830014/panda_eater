When adding a new method/constructir using the wizard, this should instantly 
update a list "this method would be adviced by [someadvice]" while typing in the 
method name. Since matching is done on the method signatures, this proposal 
sounds like a logical conclusion to me. For methods, which are only advised 
under certain conditions (e.g. with cflow) using certain advice, those advice 
could be shown italic in the list or something similar.
