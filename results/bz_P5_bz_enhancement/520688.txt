That attached screenshot shows 2 elements of the task list form as it pertains to bugzillla:

1. "See also:" list
2. "Attachments" list

The "Attachments" list is 100%, but for some reason the "See also:"  list has been made really cramped - and is not resizable. One can only view 1 and a bit "see also" bugs on the vertical, and for some reason there is a horizontal scroll bar, which just adds to the complexity and wastes vertical space. Scrolling through the list also handles very poorly.

What would be great is if it could be enhanced to look more like the Attachments list
