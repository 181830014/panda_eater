NullPointerException thrown when creating messages generated by declare error. 
Test in tests/bug/systemouts.  When run from the command-line, it produces an
NPE in CompilationResult.computePriority(CompilationResult.java:110).  When run
from the harness, it produces an NPE in
BcelShadow.findHandlerParamName(BcelShadow.java:441).  (That they are different
is not good, of course.)  Aside from checking in the test, I will attach the
stack traces and commands.  True of the current tree but not of AspectJ 1.1.1.
