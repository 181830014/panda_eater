We are about to migrate from our self made bug tracker accessed by the Generic Web Connector to a Trac system, I wonder how far this bug has been progressed. Will it be possible to move bugs from the Generic Web connector to Trac using Mylyn? This would be really great stuff!

Since the Generic web connector does not provide very much information besides name, state, owner etc,
it would be sufficient to copy all Mylyn managed information to the new bug in the other repository.

I could think of different scenarios:

1. Immediately add a bug with all provided data.
2. Pre-populate one or more bugs with the data from the original bug, update descriptions, fill in missing field and submit.

Here some sort of bulk send out unsubmitted issues would nice. Also bulk actions on several tasks at once would be helpful.
I could think of drag and drop to a different query changes e.g. component etc.
