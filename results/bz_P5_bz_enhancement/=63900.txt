The preference to not indent declarations within classes is great.  I think a 
lot of coders use this style to save space on the screen, not because they 
think indentation is bad.  So, when I have an inner (nested/anonymous) class, I 
would like to indent the inner classes declarations so that I don't mistake 
them for the outer class's.  Also, it helps me to visually identify an inner 
class.  Example:

class Foo {

int x;

public void main(String arg[]) {
    System.out.println("hello");
}

class Inner {
    public void inner1() {
        doit();
    }
    public void something() {
        stop();
    }
}

}

This preference should be true whenever "Declarations within classes" is true. 
So the preference checkbox should only be enabled when "Declarations within 
classes" is false.  The default value for this preference could be false.  This 
means that whatever your current style is, it will not be changed when this 
feature is introduced.
