I had some issues (see http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/aspectj-dev/
msg01077.html) where I had some piece of advice in a pertarget-aspect and the 
pointcut of that advice was not contained in the pertarget-pointcut. This lead 
to *for me* firstly unexpected behaviour.

I think some people could be confused by such situations because perthis/
pertarget is really not always an obvious thing, so we should have some kind of 
analysis of the appropriate pertarget/perthis-pointcut.

Might not really be a valid request but might also be worth some thoughts...
