I think it would be kind of nice if the 'package explorer' or 'navigator' had a
place to see a short project description, like a tool tip for example.  Even if
you right click and choose properties there is no place showing a simple
description.  I think the properties 'Info' page would be a perfect location for
us to enter a one line project description.  (perhaps just a place to show the
initial cvs log comment)
