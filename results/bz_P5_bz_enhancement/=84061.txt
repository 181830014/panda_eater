To allow field editors to report errors they need a dialog page (see bug 77832).
Each client has to write its own subclass of dialog page and its own widget that
handles how to show either the message or the error text.

I've currently copied PreferencePage.MessageRegion (as widget) and create my own
MessageDialogPage.
