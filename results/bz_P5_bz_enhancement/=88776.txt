I noticed that if you provide a class in both source and binary form (on the
inpath), ajc does not warn.  When outputting to a directory, ajc completes
normally (presumably the last .class wins).  When outputting to a .jar file, ajc
throws an exception saying the entry already exists.  This is a user error that
it would be nice to detect and error in both cases, as we do for duplicate
entries in source form.
