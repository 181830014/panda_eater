Zoom allows the user to select ranges he is interested in on the X and Y Axes. 
To do this, he simply clicks and drags the mouse anywhere on the chart: that 
will dynamically shade a square, while changing the mouse cursor to a magnifier 
icon. When the mouse is released, the chart will be regenerated using a new 
scale for X and Y axes defined by the square. It is possible to do several 
zooms sequentially.

To revert to the original chart, the user can click on the zoomout icon.
