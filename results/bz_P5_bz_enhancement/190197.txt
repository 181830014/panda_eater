Schematron technology need to be integrated to the current H3ET offering. The schematron validator does not have to integrate with WST's validation framework. User should be able to select one or many resources in the package explorer or right-click on an open mif sourcefile and select "Schematron Validation". When selected, a dialog box needs to come up with the possible selection of Schematron ruleset files (default directory is the project root). The user should be able to see the results of the validation in the problems view with indication regarding the severity, the cause and the location of the problem. User should have the ability of exporting the results as an xml file for further transformation. The code segment where the validation problem was reported does not have to be included in the results of the validation.
