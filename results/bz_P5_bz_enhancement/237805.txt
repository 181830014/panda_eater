Build ID: 6.0.1-GA-200710

Steps To Reproduce:
The objective is to avoid any modification in a project not associated to a task. It should ensure consistency of task and code repositories (even if it is still developer responsability to active the right task for each modification).


More information:
Prior to any checkout or modification, the developer have to choose a task. If there is no task corresponding to the work to do, then a task must be created (by developer or by project manager, depending on internal project management rules).
The option for this functionality should be on code repository side (config file?). Nobody should be able to disable this option from his own interface, except the one responsible for code repository.
It is a required functionality to guarantee the quality process of a development, and avoid human mistakes (we are not computers!).
