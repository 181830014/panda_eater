Here's some links Bernd sent to free and/or open-source conference management (submission) systems:

A site that lists open-source systems:
http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/2010/05/list-of-open-source-conference.html

http://www.easychair.org/

http://pentabarf.org/Main_Page

I haven't looked into them closely -- just a quick look around each site.
