When selecting a color, the user only has access to "hard-coded" colors. I 
don't know the RGB value for "widget background" so it would be a lot easier 
if I could choose it from a drop-down list of system color choices.  Also, 
this way it would update if I change my OS color scheme, for example high-
contrast mode.
