Hi folks,
The "linked resources" feature lets define our own Path Variables.
It would be VERY interesting to get by default one or 2 Path Vriables:
   - CURRENT_WORKSPACE: referencing the current workspace
   - ECLIPSE_HOME: referencing the Eclipse folder

Actually, if we want share a project pointing some linked resources using Path 
Variables, you must inform the other people what the Path Variables are 
supposed to reference.

Thanks for your understanding
Kind regards
Philippe
