This enhancement stems from a newsgroup conversation in late 2006.  The pertinant contribution to this thread was made by Jimisola on 2006-11-30.  Post is here: http://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.technology.mylar/msg00517.html.

Synopsis: the user should be able to configure how Mylar tracks 'elapsed time', or 'active time'.  The time spent on a task is delimited by the concept of 'inactivity'.  Unfortunately, just because Mylar thinks the task is inactive doesn't mean that the developer thinks the task is inactive.  For example, referring to external documentation might be considered 'task activity' while Mylar wouldn't.

The newsgroup thread suggests the following 4 levels of configurability:
1. time while the task is active and eclipse open (explicit control by user)
2. time while the task is active and eclipse open, but user switched to for example browser or email
3. time while the task is active and eclipse open and frontmost only
4. time while the task is active and eclipse open and frontmost and there is activity in eclipse, so no time is accumulated after a certain period of inactivity


Related bugs:
- This bug is different from bug 121337 in that 121337 asks for a modifiable 'active time' field.
- This bug is different from bug 147537 in that 147537 asks for enhancements to the activity history.
