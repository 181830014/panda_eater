I find the current mechanism for creating synchronizations frustrating at times. Selection of resources to synchronize can be tricky especially when you have many projects, and some closed. Often times I get a resource in the selection that causes the Team > Synchronize action to be disabled.  Since I've already made these selections as part of my Task/Resource working set management, it would would be convenient if these automatically became my synchronization sets, or perhaps one 'All' synchronization that includes all resources from my configured working sets.
