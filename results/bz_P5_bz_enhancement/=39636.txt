Build 20030107

When browsing plug-in details, and asking more info on a given plugin, the 
about.html is opened, which contains very little additional value in general.

The about.html should probably be a little more descriptive, with links to 
relevant ISV documentation or build notes.

Also the table view should also offer a tree view so as to quickly identify 
groups of plugins (org.eclipse.*).

Last, when asking more details on a given plugin, it could open a PDE editor on 
plugin.xml file in read-only mode, which would allow to browse plugin 
contributions etc...
