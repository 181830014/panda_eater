Hi,

Similar as the idea of working set, what about a "file set"?
which can be used to remember several opened files, I may
have to be interrupted to do some other stuff so as to open 
another group of files. if the previous file set can be 
restored, I can easily continue my previous work.

for example in the jdt, if you such as an eclipse developer
is working in process on a normal bug, unfortunately now we 
have a critical bug, then you have to pause the normal, and 
work on the critical one, afterwards you finish the critical
and return back to the normal... now a file set applies.
