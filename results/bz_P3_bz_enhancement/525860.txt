The PY4J script engine is rather inconsistent when it comes to its return values.

In some cases (like getVariables) only the string representation of objects are returned, while execution from command line at least tries some conversion methods to get more accurate return types. In case of multiline statements nothing is returned at all.

It would simplify a lot of things in the framework (code-completion, variable viewer, ...) if PY4J would return the most accurate representation it can in all cases.
