Zooming in the plot windows works, but it would be great to be able to "lock" the x- or the y-axis by pressing CTRL or ALT so you only zoom in one axis. 

(Especially just zooming over the time would be an enhancement. I thing y-axis zoom is not that important. Same here as in bug 416228, zoming into a specific area depending on mouse cursor position would be great.
