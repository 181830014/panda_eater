At the startup the following message appears:

An internal error occurred during: "Task List Indexer".
java.nio.channels.OverlappingFileLockException

I Am using Eclipse IDE for Java Developers with a javaWorkspace in the "Google Drive File Stream" at g: drive. Eclipse is installed in the c: driver, if this matters.

How to solve it?
