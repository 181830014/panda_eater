Other folks on the team and Pivotal may have ideas on how this workflow should exist, but to me it seems the bluemix application deployment wizard should, in the manifest.yml scenario:
- If the user has a service specified that is not bound, the finish button should be grayed out until it can be bound
- An error should be displayed in the wizard header until the service exists (also, I think we should only display the error on the services page itself)
