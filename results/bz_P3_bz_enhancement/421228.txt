[This is in connection with request #421226, but as it is really a different issue I'm choosing to file it separately, I think that's easier to track.]

It would be very convenient to have a complete overview of special Ant tasks for the Epsilon workflow language, plus their parameters; preferably in the Epsilon book.

One thing in particular that could be better documented (apart from the existence of the xsdFile parameter, see request #421226) is the search path for files used by the epsilon.loadModel task. Contrary to what one would expect this does *not* search in the location set as the base directory for the Ant script; instead (if my analysis is right) it looks by default in a subdirectory "models". In contrast, epsilon.emf.loadModel does search in the base directory.
