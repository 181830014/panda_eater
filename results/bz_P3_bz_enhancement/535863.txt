To ensure API compatibility between scripts and the modules they consume it would be good to have a semantic versioning method for modules. This version could be checked either during module loading or on demand in the script.

If the module's version does not meet the criteria an Exception should be thrown.

All version checks should be optional and should not break existing code.

Example:
The script needs the Charting module with a version greater or equal than 1.1.0 but less than 2.0.0. Currently version 1.2.3 is installed.

During module loading:
  loadModule("/Charting", version="[1.1.0,2.0.0)"); -> works

On demand:
  module = loadModule("/Charting");
  module.checkVersion("[2.0.0,3.0.0)"); -> Exception thrown


Note: The plugin's version might not suffice if it defines more than 1 module. Therefore this would work better in the module itself.
