I think the action "Synchronize with source code" is a misnomer. From the name of the action and its associated icon, I expected it to work like the Eclipse outline or "Link with Editor" in the Package Explorer. That is, a single click in the model editor would have highlighted the source code in the code editor, and a double-click would have opened the source file and selected the range.

But it doesn't work this way: it does nothing on single-click, and the option actually controls whether double-clicking will open the properties view or a code editor.

So, I think it should be named something like "Open in source editor on double-click". It's a bit of a long name for a menu entry though. So maybe just "Open source on double-click".
