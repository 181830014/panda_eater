I have the following configuration in my task list (simplified):

- Mylyn bugs (query)
- Patch verify pending (category)
- Working on Patch (category)

Normally when working on some patch, I copy the task to "Working on patch" category. After submiting the patch, I move it to "patch verify" category.

Usually I do this move by using "Move to..." context menu action in task list. The problem is that because of the query, the task appears 2 times: in the query itself and the category.

After doing the move, the focus move to the task in the query, not in the category. This unexpected jump is confusing and disorients me.

The focus should move to the task in the target category.
