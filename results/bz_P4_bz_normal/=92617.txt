We need a simpler (and faster) implementation of XMLRootElementContentDescriber.
We are currently using SAX parsing nad that is very costly. The same behavior
could be achieved with a very simple parsing algorithm. All we want to know
about the contents are:
- has a XML declaration?
- if so, what is the encoding in the XML declaration?
- if it has a doctype, what is the system id?
- what is the name of the root element?
- what are the attributes for the root element?
That is about it.
