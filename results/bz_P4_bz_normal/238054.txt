If two calls appear on a single line to an advised method, the corresponding advise lists only a single method call being advised. This probably isn't very severe for normal users, but it may be troublesome for developers coding against the AJDT (like myself). Consider the following example:

class A {
	void x() {}
	void y() { x();x();}
}

aspect B {
	before() : call(* A.x()) {}
}

If you right-clicked on the above advice declaration it would only show a single method being advised when there is in fact two.
