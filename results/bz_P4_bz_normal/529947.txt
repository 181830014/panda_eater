The plugin.xml of the tabbar contribution which make the tabbar becoming odd

As I tried to follow the example "Provide tab-bar extensions" in the sirius documentation, I unfortunately remove the icon path (cf. attachment), start a runtime. When I selected a diagram element the tabbar icons became biggers then I selected the background and the tabbar disappear (cf. video attachment).
