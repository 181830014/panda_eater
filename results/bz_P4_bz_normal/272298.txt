The following model:

@BasicCollection
@Lob
public Collection<byte[]> getAudio() {
  return audio;
}

Note: this is an EclipseLink configuration above and beyond what is specified in the JPA spec. 

This mapping in some cases would work just fine whereas in other configurations the data retrieved from the database would be incorrect. JDBC issue? Really unsure at this point. In a straight up JUnit test this mapping worked just fine, however the same test run through the testing browser would fail.
