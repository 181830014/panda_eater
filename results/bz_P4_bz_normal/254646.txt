In EclipseLink JPA inheritance xml test suite, the entity mapping file is orm.xml, it deploy failed on WLS with the following Exception:
Exception Description: Conflicting xml elements [<id>] with the same name [id] were found. The first
 was found in the mapping file [zip:C:/EclipseLink/bea10.3/wlserver_10.3/samples/domains/eclipselink
2/servers/myserver/tmp/_WL_user/eclipselink-xml-test-model/ycs5c/eclipselink-xml-test-model_ejb.jar!
/META-INF/orm.xml] and the second in the mapping file [jar:file:/C:/EclipseLink/bea10.3/wlserver_10.
3/samples/domains/eclipselink2/servers/myserver/tmp/_WL_user/eclipselink-xml-test-model/ycs5c/eclips
elink-xml-test-model_ejb.jar!/META-INF/orm.xml]. Named xml elements must be unique across the persistence unit.

If I change the orm.xml to any other name, everything is fine. Seem the orm.xml is default entity mapping file name, and it was loaded twice during deploy on WLS server. Based on the above Exception, the orm.xml point to the same location and same jar file.
