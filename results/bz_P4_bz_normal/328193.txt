There is currently a class FunctionUtils with static entry points to inference. It is used from classes that are not created by the guice injector. This class has a type inference instance separate from the one used by the evaluator.

All calls in the evaluator except one have been replaced with use of the injected type inference instance.
But the call in "prepare call" (See note in source with reference to this bug) - when replaced will cause some b3 tests to fail.

The reason is somewhat mysterious - but may relate to the specific functions (the system function Inject) doing something in a bad way. Or it could be caused by caching (the other instance has a separate cache).
