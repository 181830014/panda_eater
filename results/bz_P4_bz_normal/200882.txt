We have been operating with basically any and all output produced by the build captured in the default "build log". This results in log files that are 32 megabytes each! For one build! 

While that can be handy or required to confirm the build is working as expected, it actually gets in the way of finding specific problems, since it is hard to work with a file that large, and it's hard to find the wheat in the chafe.
