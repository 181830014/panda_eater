Hello,

I tested this bug on WTP RC4. Create a new jsp file and paste the following:

<<%
String bla = "";
%>

<%=bla %>

The first <% %> regions is not parsed as a jsp region. WTP cannot resolve name bla at line 5.
Tomcat does not have any problems with this test case and will parse this file successfully.

Best Regards,
Patric Rufflar
