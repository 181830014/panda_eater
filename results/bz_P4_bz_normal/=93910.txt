When switching between the welcome and an eclipse perspective there is a
noticeable moment where the welcome title is double drawn.

This doesn't look good for a new user to see.

Steps
1. open product  [in clean state , without a existing workspace]
2. click "Tutorials" [on the welcome]
3. click on "Build a standalone SWT application"
4. it will switch to the default perspective
    as it does this you will see the welcome title drawn twice


Note: This isn't a "first time" hit. If you reopen the welcome and repeat the
actions you can still see the graphic effect.

Also note that we are hitting this in our WID product as well. Greg has
indicated that he would really like to get this address for our v6 release.

Some additional data points:
- you can notice this when using just the Go to the workbench link as well but
it occurs a lot fast so it is not as easy to see
- it could have something to do with the toolbar being re-enabled or
setVisible(true) again as it is not shown when the full welcome is displayed
