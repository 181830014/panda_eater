starting with the following page:

<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
       <p>Hello</p>
    </body>
</html>


select the just the text -> <p>Hello</p>

then on the menu bar click Source -> Format -> Active Elements

result -> page now looks like this:

<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
<p>Hello</p>
</body>
</html>

notice that the closing </body> tag has been moved left even though it was not an active element.  

It would also be nice if "format active elements" respected the proper indentation based on the surrounding tags. This may be a separate bug or as designed though, not sure.
