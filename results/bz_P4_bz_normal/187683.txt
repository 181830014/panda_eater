Right now, the data collected on mylar.eclipse.org can contain duplicate interaction events which will pollute the statistics.  We need to ensure that the old files are overwritten when a newer file is uploaded.

Mik suggested always uploading the current data as "current-xxx.zip" so it would override the last upload.  We could always upload the current file, and the last completed month so that we won't lose any data.

For example, if I were to upload my data today it would send the "current-xxx.zip" file which would contain data from May 1 - May 17 and the Apr07 file which would contain data from Apr 1 - Apr 30.  The "current-xxx.zip" would overwrite the previous "current-xxx.zip" file with my user ID - if I had previously uploaded this month then we are simply deleting the last file containing data from May 1 - May X (where X is the day I last uploaded) and if I had previously uploaded in April, we are still ok because we always upload the last month's worth of data.
