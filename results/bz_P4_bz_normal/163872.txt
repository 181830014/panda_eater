Iteration Plan
•  See remarks for Template: Iteration Plan for formatting changes in bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=163869
•  Key Milestone should be clearer
     What's being shown at the demo? The milestone should indicate the critical feature being demoed.
•  Evaluation criteria needs to be concrete
     "Favorable response", "well received", and "favorable acceptance" isn't concrete enough. There needs to be a concrete sign-off, an OK, or something that can objectively close the evaluation criteria.

Project Plan
•  This example isn't for a development project - we should provide something from software development
•  Role assignments need to be shown to match the template
•  The measurements should provide an example that follows the recommendations of the Guideline: Agile Estimation
•  Make scope of project plan consistent
The Introduction says the plan does not apply to the tooling component, but the Milestones section includes tooling.
