When applying a patch (Apply Patch wizard) we could indicate that a hunk was installed at a different line from the line number specified in the patch. In other words, we could give an information about the offset used to match the hunk.

A single large offset may be a little bit suspicious and may indicate that the hunk was installed in the wrong place.
