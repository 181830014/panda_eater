The poll configuration widget in the Remote Monitor is a nice idea. 
This is very unusual within eclipse to have view controlling elements at the bottom.
I can see why it is good for beginners, but even when collapsed it hides 1-2
row of the table

But it would be nice to totally remove it (e.g. by using a preference or a toggle button
in the view tool bar).
The information should also be available from the view menu and maybe a tool bar button.
