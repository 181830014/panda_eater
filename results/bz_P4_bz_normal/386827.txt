There are plenty of open source libraries that allows web diagramming, and it is clear that the same PIM models (GMFGraph, GMFMap, and to some extent GMF-Tooling) may be used as an input for transformation/codegen targeting one of those libraries. 

This Bugzilla is to discuss the different implementation choices in this area. The most important of them seems to be: 
- should we use RAP? It was very slow a year ago, but reported to be better now. 
- should we use SVG or HTML5 Canvas as an underlying graphical engine 
- should the generation target javascript or, GWT java code, or e.g, Flash (see http://www.slideshare.net/architexa/conquering-gef-part2-building-graphical-webapps-with-eclipse)
- what we can reuse from CDO Dawn
- should we wait for http://gefgwt.org/ project planned for release early this autumn
