Build: M7

How to reproduce this problem:
1. Create a new Java project.  Leave the Java Build Path settings so that
all folders under the project are considered to be packages.
2. Create a folder (not a package) in the Java project named "aPackage".
Link this folder to a directory _under_ the project.  I browsed to the 
project directory and created a new directory.  Under windows this new directory
is called "New Folder".  If you are reproducing this bug on a non-ms platform
call the directory "New Folder" to follow along.  This is the crux of the bug.
3. Create a class named "Foo" in the aPackage package.  Notice that
the class compiles fine.
4. Close the project.
5. Open the project.
6. An error is added to the Problems view which states:
The declared package does not match the expected package New Folder

I assume the compiler is using the file names on the filesystem to perform
compilation rather than using the file names in the workspace.  I would expect
the compiler to use the filesystem model in stand-alone model, but the workspace
model when invoked from the workbench.
 		
Also the Foo.java class and the aPackage package are not decorated with 
error markers, although the project is.
					
I realize this is a bizarre use case, but I can imagine a (new/confused) user
making this mistake.
