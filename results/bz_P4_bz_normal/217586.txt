Currently it's hard (near impossible) to tell exactly which WTP build is used in a particular EPP build, since the EPP builds are feature based. 

It would be nice to have some (server side) way to match up a WTP build with an EPP build. 

For example, we know what features versions are in each WTP build, so we could programatically search for "best fit" in EPP's build logs, such as
