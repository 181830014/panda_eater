I used "declare parents" for HttpSession and added a field.  However, if use something that implements HttpSession, it does not get woven correctly if the mock class and the interface are not in the test cases.

I blogged about what the original idea is here:

I think that it is a classloading issue, and I've asked on the mailing list.  Opening a ticket on Andy Clement's request.
