Currently, this feature is available through a requirement's tree
But we would like to improve it and permit to make some modifications into a requirement table

We must :
- Allow to modify requirements through the table either the tree
- If a modification is made in the table, it must be done in the tree too (vice versa)
- Use predicat-based styling for each row
