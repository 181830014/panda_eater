I am using MoDisco to discover UML interaction models from Java code.

I am analysing a kdm ActionElement representing a method invocation. How can I know which code element is the target object (the object that will receive the method call) ?

In this post (http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/356704/), it is said that "kdm Action Elements of kind "method invocation" have Calls accessible via their reference actionRelation.Each Calls element has "to" and "from" references, respectively giving the called MethodUnit and the element (variable, other method invocation, etc) on which it is called"

However, in the kdm model, the reference "from" is the ActionElement from which the call relation originates. I do not find the way to obtain the object that receive the method call. For example:

the following sentence in java code:

"a.method(b) "

is translated in the kdm model:
.....
" - [ActionElement] expression statement
      - [ActionElement] method invocation
             -actionRelation
                   - Calls
                         -to: [MethodUnit] method
                         -from: [ActionElement] method invocation "

How I can get the object 'a'?

Thank you in advance.
Best regards,
