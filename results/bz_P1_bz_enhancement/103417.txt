This would be very helpful as it would enable having JUnit testcases for codegen
document parsing and snippet update. The problem seems to be that codegen
requires an editor to populate the emf model. If all references to the editor
are removed then the EMF model can be built by codegen. 
This should be done for 1.2 as it saves a lot of pain in testing codegen/snippet
update problems which have a nasty habit of reappearing five minutes before
product shipping.
