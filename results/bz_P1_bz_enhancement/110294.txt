This is hard to fix, but if you have the option set so that unused imports 
create compile errors you drop a JavaBean and get the import, and then you 
delete it and the import remains and you have a compile error.  Ctrl+Shift+O 
will fix it for you but if there a way to do it in code gen automatically it 
would be nice.
