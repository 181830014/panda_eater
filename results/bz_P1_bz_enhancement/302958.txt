I need to implement https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/PLE-693 for JIRA connector. I can copy TaskEditorCommentPart, change it to my needs and replace the editor comment part for JIRA but this way I will duplicate a lot of code. 
The best way would be to add additional API to the TaskEditorCommentPart and allow to contribute to the comment title bar by extending TaskEditorCommentPart and overwriting additional API method.
Example patch attached.

Reproducible: Always
