Currently picks an inappropriate default, and allows the
user to hit OK. Pretty much guarantees that the user will
at best get an unhelpful error message in the Problems view,
and at worst will expose low value corner cases in the content.

Should not pick any default value for required args, and
not allow the user to click OK until they have some value.
