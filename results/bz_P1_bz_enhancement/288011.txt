module-wide configs of type String should be declared of type const char[] in lieu of const char*, both to save space as well as to ensure that any literal string assigned to this config would reside in read-only memory.  with conditional linking, any unreferenced configs of type String would be omitted from the final executable -- including the char[] array itself, which today is not removed.

this feature maintains binary backward-compatibility....
