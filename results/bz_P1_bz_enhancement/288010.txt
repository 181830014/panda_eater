like other standard types, individual targets should be able to define a special symbol in their own std.h which would designate the target itself has defined xdc_Bool on its own; the xdc/std.h file would not define xdc_Bool in this case.

the default definition of xdc_Bool is unsigned short, which is less than desirable on some targets.
