Screenshot of the NPE

I get a NullpointerException when reopening my Project. It seems to have corrupted info about my customFBs. The connections in my CustomFBs are there, but it saved the FB with a wrong name in the .sys file. There is some other information missing and adding it through the text editor didn't help. I cannot open the application anymore everything is gone.

How I did it:

Create a new System, through the file explorer copy customFBs from another project. Edit those FBs and add another one. Create an application using these FBs, map it to a Device and save. Close 4diac, reopen and then in my case I got a NullpointerException.

I hope this gets resolved and never happens again. I sadly don't know the exact cause why this happened.

How to fix it:

Backup project

See in which FBs the connection source/destination can't be found, open .sys file in a text editor and add missing Type info. Verify in the .fbt file using a text editor whether the name is written correctly. Remove old project from workspace (move to different folder) and import project (system won't work) from File dialog.

This will now reopen the System with two(?) applications, one with and one without device mappings. Delete the one without mappings and redo all connections going from and to the corrupted block(s).
