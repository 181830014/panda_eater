Screenshot of bug

I have added gradle nature to a project. Afterwards I wanted to configure gradle but I cannot get to the menue item as an error appears "Could not accept changes - The current displayed page contains invalid values.

Gradle files are already available in the project.

Without beeing able to configure gradle, the manual dependency management becomes a headache. At the moment I cannot build the project.
