Hi,

Both action buttons "Only show commons columns" and "Hide empty columns" state is not well refreshed when using undo/redo action.

A click in the table editor is necessary for the button's state to be updated. We should add a call to the method notifyActions() in the setInput() one (class NatTableWidget)

Regards,
Nicolas Guyomar
