Currently when a session is opened, Sirius will load all the semantic resources associated to it, transitively (it will also load all the representation resources and referenced VSM, but this is out of scope of this specific issue).

This is bad for performance, both in session opening time and in memory usage.

There are many reasons which this is so, but they must all be fixed. This bugzilla will serve as a top-level issue for all such issues.
