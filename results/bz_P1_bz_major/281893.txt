Imagine a corporate setting where a lot of developers might all start Eclipse and nail the server at the same time.  I know Mylyn synchs on startup, but does it start the "20 minutes" at the point that the first synchronization stops?  If it does, then that would at least build a little variation into everyone's clocks so that every 20 minutes the server does not get nailed again.  Likewise, have you considered adding a small amount of fudge to the interval?  Like some smallish random interval added to the 20 minutes.  I'd suggest some number between 1 and 120 seconds to create some variation?  It might be useful to also do this at startup, although personally I wish Mylyn just waited the 20 minutes before it did the first synchronization.

Finally, can a repository provider specify a minimum interval?  So that users cannot specify something like 1 minute as their interval and stress the server?  Since Mylyn runs in the background, a user might not even realize how much they are hurting the server performance.
