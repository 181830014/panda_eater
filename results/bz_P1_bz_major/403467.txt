Today's Eclipse Log

Ever since upgrading to Juno SR2 my Mylyn task list is empty each day when I start Eclipse. I have tried restoring, both to the original directory and a new directory but the next day the task list is empty again.

Originally I upgraded via the automatic update. Later I downloaded the J2EE package and re-installed.

I attached the contents of my Eclipse log from today.
