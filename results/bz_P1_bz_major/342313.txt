I opened a task in my list and was very surprised to find an unsubmitted comment that I thought I had submitted days before. The task did not have an outgoing arrow in the task list and the clear outgoing option in the context menu was grayed out. I guess the submit failed for some reason after the outgoing state of the task was cleared.
