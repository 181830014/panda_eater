If you click on Programcpu pull down, only null is provided as a choice (the existing value is not provided as a choice).  As a result it is _very_ easy to accitently set Program.cpu to null; this will cause _lots_ of downstream errors since packages need the information in Program.cpu for just about everything.

Similarly, Program.build and Program.platform, ... should be readonly from xgconf.
