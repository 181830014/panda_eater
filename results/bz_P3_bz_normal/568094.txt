Connection creation via ctrl + click will be implemented soon, see .

As the ECC editor already implements several ctrl + click creation features, this should be harmonized. 

Current status in ECC editor: 
1 Hovering over State --> Ctrl + click --> adds new action to this state 
2 Ctrl + click over empty space --> creates new state
3 selecting a state, dragging a transition --> ctrl + click --> creates new state and a transition from the originally selected state


Current status in FB Editor: (after the above mentioned commit is merged) 
1 selecting IE --> ctrl starts connection creation mode --> clicking on compatible IE will create connection 

Possible ways of improvement: 
- as in the ECC editor hovering over a state (1) allows ctrl+click mode, hovering over an IE + ctrl should also enable the connection creation mode. 

- selecting a state and ctrl+click on free space should not only create a state, but also a connection to the originally selected state and the new state should then be selected
