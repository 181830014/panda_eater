In the che.bat form che 4.0.0-beta-13 is probably a bug or something that could lead to issues.

JAVA_VERSION=$(eval "${JAVA_HOME}"/bin/java -version 2>&1 | awk -F '"' 

If JAVA_HOME is something like "C:\Program Files\Java\.." the space between "Progam Files" will lead the bash to stop. 


This will solve the problem: 

JAVA_VERSION=$(eval "'${JAVA_HOME}'"/bin/java -version 2>&1 | awk -F '"' 

[Note the additional quote.]

I don't know how eval handles this single and double quote, but this solved it for me.
