Hi,
I am working with MQTT in Forte and wanted to Publish some infrastructure messages using retain flag SET but unfortunately I could not do it in forte. I think it will required by other applications to Publish with Retain Flag True. It could an optional parameter along with Topic. I propose parameter structure like following:
raw[].mqtt[tcp://endpoint:1883,clientID,*topic*,*TRUE/FALSE*]

The forth parameter could be used as optional to set retain flag to TRUE.
