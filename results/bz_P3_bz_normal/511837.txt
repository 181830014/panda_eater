Example project showing the ambiguity

Duplicate query detection does not detect duplicate operations that originate from meta-models.

In the following template I think the definition of isSuperTypeOf should have been flagged as an error because the same operation exists in the meta-model of ecore already

[module generate('http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore')]
[query public isSuperTypeOf(someClass : EClass) : EBoolean = false /]
[template public generateElement(anEClass : EClass)]
[file (anEClass.name, false, 'UTF-8')]
[anEClass.isSuperTypeOf(anEClass) /]
[/file]
[/template]
