Wrong Context Menu

https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1106232/

I've installed EASE from the Marketplace into Eclipse 2020-12 and it seems once it is there it takes over the context menus in my default perspective. The Scripting perspective also has a broken shell. If I remove just the UI Components feature it fixes my context menus and the shell but then I can't use the UI features. I'm not sure if this is a 2020-12 issue or another conflict.
