Eclipse Che logos

Hello,

We're working on the ECD Tools website and noticed that the Eclipse Che logo is in white on a white background:
https://ecdtools.eclipse.org/#projects

Can you please update the logo in your PMI and on your website. I've attached the logo files required. Sharon MacDonald confirmed that the logo should include the trademark symbol as attached in the first instance that it appears on the website: https://www.eclipse.org/che/

The Wordmark "Eclipse Che" is registered so in the first instance of web copy, it should be spelt like this: Eclipse CheÂ®.
