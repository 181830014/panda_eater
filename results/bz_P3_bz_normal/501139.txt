When a metamodel is deployed via the Target Platform, the arborescent Ecore editor is able to import it (i.e. Load Resource... > Browse Target Platform Packages). Acceleo, however, is not able to do so.

Expectation: Acceleo should resolve metamodel URIs against the metamodels contained in the Target Platform.
