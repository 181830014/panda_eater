When running the Rhino Debugger and having an Error/Exception in a function that is called from inside a catch block, the Stacktrace is incomplete.

Steps to reproduce:
 * run code below in debugger
 * observe output

Code to reproduce:
	function printException(e) {
		var s = ''
		s += name
	}
	
	try {
		var l = new java.util.LinkedList()
		l.get(100)
	} catch(e) {
		printException(e)
	}

Expected output:
org.eclipse.ease.ScriptExecutionException: ReferenceError: "name" is not defined.
	at trace_fault.js:printException:3
	at trace_fault.js:14

Actual output:
org.eclipse.ease.ScriptExecutionException: ReferenceError: "name" is not defined.
	at trace_fault.js:14

This behaviour does not change if the stacktrace would be deeper, it always only gives the line of the call inside the catch block.

Bug appears in ease 0.3.0
