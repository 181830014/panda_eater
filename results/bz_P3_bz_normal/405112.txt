Hi,

I've written a script to transform a json documents from the qooxdoo library into vjo. However, I'm not finished but wanted to know where are some errors, as far as I've progressed. So I thought the validation might help, to show me the errors.

However, the "Rebuilding" process hangs up, eclipse consumes >100% cpu and the only way to get out there is killing eclipse from the os activity monitor. The percentage value at which the process stuck is different every time.

The qooxdoo library is very big, which might be a reason. I committed the project to github: https://github.com/gossi/QooxdooTL So, you can check out the project and validate on your own.
