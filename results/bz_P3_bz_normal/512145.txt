I used a non-existing variable. Wrong data is used in this case.

As Input variable (WSTRING), the follwing was declared:

json[value].mqtt[%mqtthost%, %mqttclientid%, %topic_lifecounter%]


However, %mqttclientid% was not defined.  Any data was used instead for %mqttclientid% and %topic_lifecounter%. The result is not reproducable.
