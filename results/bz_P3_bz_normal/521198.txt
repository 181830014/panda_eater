Proposed patch

I forgot to register some required meta-models during a maven build in the pom.xml files for my project. Instead of generating an error message it crashed the build with an NPE.

A patch is attached that will at least allow the build to finish. It will show messages like:

 Cannot find operation (someOperation(null)) for the type (null)

instead of crashing.
