When a motor needs to run until it receives a stop signal there are two possibilities. The first is to set the pwm and use a QX Block to write outX.motor.enable or to set the speedsp and run the motor using a QX block to write outX.motor.enableSpeed. When using the pwm solution, the motor can sometimes end up in a running stalled state, where 4diac says the motor is enabled and running, but the motor does actually not move. This can be solved using the speedsp method. This is rather important when the system should work reliably. Please either fix the running stalled issue or remove it from the processinterface as it is nowhere documented which method to use. It would be ok if it is still part of the processinterface, but a warning in the documentation would be helpful as it sometimes won't start due to the motor being stalled even though there is nothing that can stall it.
