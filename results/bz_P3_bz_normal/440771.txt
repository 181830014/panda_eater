Every other MQTT library uses "publish" to publish messages, and "topic" for the topic.  It's rather odd to find "send" and "destinationName" used in this library instead.

Seeing as any semblance of backwards compatibility was already broken, it would be a major improvement to make this more in line with every other user and library.
