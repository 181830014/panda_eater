Hi,

Currently for Android app development I use ADT.

I am beginning to use components which require Java 8.

However, when I select Java 8 as the Java version for my project, ADT responds with the following message:

"Android requires compiler compliance level 5.0 or 6.0. Found '1.8' instead. Please use Android Tools > Fix Project Properties."

Does Andmore support Java 8?

If at all possible, I do not want to switch to Android Studio but I do need to use components that require Java 8.

I would appreciate a response either way.

Thanks,

Alex Donnini
