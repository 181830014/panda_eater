I would like to report a bug when generating UI for Entity Service (List and Manage Entity Template) in the ScriptingServices folder.

I choose to use the date widget option for a date field, but when I try to edit the html file in the Preview tab, I am unable to edit the date properly. I can edit it, in general, but the resulting date is incorrect. For example, when I choose 03/09/2007 (March), the visible result in the UI is 02/08/2007 (February).

Thank you in advance for the assistance!
