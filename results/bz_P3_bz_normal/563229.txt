UnEqualSpace-FB-left-right-side

With Current implementation, space at the left and right side of FB is not equal. Left side space is more because of the idea of having more WITH on the left side than the right side.

So Suggestion:
it would be better to calculate the space based on how many WITHs are really set and not based on the events
