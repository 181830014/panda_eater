Based on this article: https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2015/april/article1.php, it seems like it's possible to use extension types to add a new supported application type to the Cloud Foundry server.  But when I used the org.cloudfoundry.ide.eclipse.server.core.application extension type to add a new application type to Cloud Foundry, I found that it's not working properly.  Can new application types be added and supported in Cloud Foundry using extensions?
