When installing EASE from the update site, I would like to be able to install only the EASE core and a single javascript engine (no matter whether Rhino or Nashorn, actually).

I don't want to get the JSDT dependency when doing so (AFAIK it is not really required), especially as it does not work with JSDT 2+.

The suggestion is to have features similar to this:

 * All-In-One (easy to install getting started packages)
    * EASE for JavaScript (includes Rhino, Nashorn, JSDT, ...)
    * EASE for Python (includes JPython, PyDev?, ...)
 * EASE Core packages
    * EASE Core
    * EASE Rhino Engine (depends on core)
    * EASE Nashorn Engine (...)
    * ...

Is this a good idea?
