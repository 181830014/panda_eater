create EntityManager with property "PersistenceUnitProperties.QUERY_TIMEOUT", then retrive the property by using em.getProperties(), you will see "javax.persistence.query.timeout=20" is listed there. But the property doesn't take effect on UpdateObjectQuery, as a result the execution of "UPDATE...." as for updating locked relationship for locked entity won't return. 

Because of the problem, the PessimisticLockingExtendedScopeTestSuite can't be enabled to run.
