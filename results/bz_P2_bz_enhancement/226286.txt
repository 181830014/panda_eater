We need to improve user experience by eliminating the possibility of blank/empty views.  The task list is subject to this usability problem when switching working sets:

1) "Go into" folder A
2) Select working set B that does not contain A

I'd like to propose that if the selected working set doesn't contain the current gone into folder that the view is reset to the top.
