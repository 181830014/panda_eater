Axis2 provides an implementation of JAX-WS, which provides a library of annotations for web services.  COSMOS code has been using annotations that Joel contributed to the project.  The "COSMOS annotations" are oriented towards management interfaces.  Despite the difference, there may be annotations that have similar purposes, and can be reconciled.  This enhancement is for "lining up" the two set of annotations, and use the JAX-WS standard where possible.
