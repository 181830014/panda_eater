The framework currently launches a sync of a task upon opening. Ideally this would only happen if there were in fact stale. We could run a preSynchronization in fact changes to retrieve.  Might be able to make use of the current connector preSynchronization with only the the task to be opened set on the ISynchronizationSession.
