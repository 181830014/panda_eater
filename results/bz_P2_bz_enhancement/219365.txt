We encourage the use of the Focus on Workweek facility as the main way of using the Task List, but given the amount of feedback from people who have not noticed the Focused mode, the toolbar button is not discoverable enough.  We need to brainstorm ways of making it more noticable.  For example, after the user has scheduled their first task, bring up a PONT dialog that offers to focus the Task List.
