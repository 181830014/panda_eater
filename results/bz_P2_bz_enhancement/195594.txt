When I tried to add manual folder in preference. 
My man directory is tcl and under tcl directory, there are TclCmd,TclLib and UserCmd directories.
I can set TclCmd with no problem.
But, I can't set rest of directories.

Can the manual folders to be set from upper directory, in this case, "tcl", and DLTK can recursively to discover the sub-directory without users specify all sub-directory?

Thanks
