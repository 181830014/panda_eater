In Mylyn 2.1 there used to be a way to validate changes in the task editor before they are submitted.  It looks like this capability was removed in the 3.0 API.  It is certainly possible to validate values for a bug/task at the actual repository commit in a connector implementation, but it seems like it might still be useful for simple validation to allow this at editing time before the "submit" is actually executed.
