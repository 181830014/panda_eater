If a ReportQuery is constructed on which setMaxRows is invoked, and if this ReportQuery is used as a subquery in a ReadAllQuery using Expression.in(), then the LIMIT clause is missing on PostgreSQL.

If setMaxRows is invoked on the surrounding ReadAllQuery, the LIMIT clause is present, but this is obviously not a functioning workaround.
