If you use session or descriptor events in JPA, you cannot access or use the JPA EntityManager or Factory.  We should add back references to the Session and UnitOfWork back to the EntityManager and EntityManagerFactory.

We could link them directly, since we already have JPA dependencies from core, or we could set them as a property, or as an Object and add an unwrap or wrap API to Session to obtain them.
