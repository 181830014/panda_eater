I have a set of ordinary Java projects, and one Web project. In the web project, I am trying to add all the other projects to the j2ee module dependencies. When I try to do this, eclipse tries to modify the .project file for each one. This is not OK. Why does eclipse need to do this to add the outputs of the dependent project to the web project?

Do I really need to do any of this? If I make the dependent projects into ordinary dependencies, will they be available when deployed in a server?
