Attribute overrides using delimiters are not supported.
User customization requires setting additional flag.
There are likely other issues.

Delimited support should be automatic and globally configured at the Project level and not the metadata processor level.

When a database field is created by a user the name should be checked for delimiters in which case the field should be marked as using delimiters.
