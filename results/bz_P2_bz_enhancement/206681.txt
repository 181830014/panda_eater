I have re-enabled the tests which check for the basic bundle structure from the build output. (we have a manifest, about.html, class files or jar file, etc)

We should look at actually analyzing further, especially in the area of the manifest file since in the past we have seen cut and paste errors w.r.t. bundle ids, etc. We should ensure that the bundle ids for source bundles are correct, for instance.
