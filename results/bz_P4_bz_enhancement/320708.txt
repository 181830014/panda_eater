One query should be devidable in at least three sub groups.

Group 1 should contain all matched tickets, that are new.
Group 2 should contain all matched tickets, that are resolved.
Group 3 should contain all matched tickets with state closed.

Using three separate queries would be possible, but would waste a lot of room.

Reproducible: Always
