When "Filter completed tasks" is enable, 
the unread completed tasks are not displayed in the Task List view. 
It is necessary to disable "Filter completed tasks" once for the confirmation. 
It is convenient that unread task is displayed in the Task List  view even 
when "Filter completed tasks" is enable. 

I want the mode that displays unread completion task in the Task List  view 
when "Filter completed tasks" is enable.
