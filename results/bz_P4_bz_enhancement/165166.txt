In the Navigator view it would be nice, if one could drag and drop a file onto a .bat (command batch) file and that would start the .bat-file with the dropped file's name as parameter (as one can in Window's explorer).

Right now, this only causes a no-entry sign to appear while the mouse hovers over the .bat file. Ideally, this would work with ALL executables, that the platform supports... :-)
