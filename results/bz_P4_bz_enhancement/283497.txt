+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #283405 +++

Build ID: Build id: 20090621-0832

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Select a Marker in the Tasks-View with a comment longer than one line. E.g.:   
    /** FIXME: This method doesn't really belong here anymore.
     * These exceptions started out as foo exceptions, but now are
     * generic honk exceptions. So they should be read by the
     * honk, and this method should become a honk method. 
     */

2. Select "New Task from marker"

Now I got a task with the title: 
Java Task: FIXME : This method doesn't really belong here anymore.

And the Comment:
-----
Resource: /src/java/com/foo/nlp/bar/bar.java
Location: line 19
-----


*Expected behavior*:
A new task with the same title:
Java Task: FIXME : This method doesn't really belong here anymore.

But with the Comment:
------
This method doesn't really belong here anymore.
These exceptions started out as foo exceptions, but now are
generic honk exceptions. So they should be read by the
honk, and this method should become a honk method.
