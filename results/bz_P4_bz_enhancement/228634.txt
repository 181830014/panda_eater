Following discussion on bug 205730, I'd love to see a way to take a screenshot of my desktop without Eclipse window getting in my way. Currently it's painful as it requires moving both Eclipse window and wizard window out of the sight as much as possible, and it's not a perfect solution if you want to take a screenshot of a maximized application (other than Eclipse of course). An option to take the screenshot with a global keystroke or after a specified amount of time and/or automatically minimize Eclipse window when you hit the button would be great.
