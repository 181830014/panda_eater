When "automatic changeset management" is enabled, changeset comment is correctly created with the user-provided template. However, the comment is recreated everytime I click on "edit changeset", which makes it impossible to incrementally add comments to the changeset. This (incremental comments) is the default behavior for "edit changeset" when Mylyn isn't in control, and IMHO a is a great feature, I don't see any reason for resetting it everytime.

I believe the best approach would be to create the base template only once (maybe provide a "reset template" button somewhere), and let the user add more info to it as he/she desires.
