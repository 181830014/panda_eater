The following would be nice to have a as a single-click invoked completion on a
task, probably via a wizard
- unit tests and suite referred to by the report are run
- if successful
  - if bugzilla report 
    - add completion comment and resolve
  - if resources in CVS
    - commit is made with final comment and description
  - mark task complete
  - remove reminder
  - deactivate context
