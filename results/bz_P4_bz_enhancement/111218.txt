Mylar's are useful for sharing the structure associated with tasks (e.g. bug
reports).  For example, if you pair program on a task on one machine, then one
of the programmers needs to complete the task on their own machine, it would be
nice to send them the context of the task by simply dragging the task or bug
report to a person in a buddy list (an XML file).  Currently this is cumbersome
and requires email and way too many clicks.  So Shawn prototyped a
Jabber/Smack-based layer very similar to ECF's.  But ECF looks more mature, and
I wonder if it is better for us to layer any additional collaborative support
that we need on top of ECF.

Ed: I'm CC'ing you because your interview with Scott was useful, and you showed
up in his buddy list I thought that you might have some input on how this should
work :)

Scott: what we need on the sender's end is to have the buddy list support
drag-and-drop, have a drop initiate a file transfer of the XML context, along
with the ID of the bug report.  On the receiver's end, we need to be able to
execute code to add the bug report to the list and write the task context file
to the right location in the workspace.  How hard would this be to do in ECF?
