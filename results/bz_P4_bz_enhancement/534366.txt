Hi.
  It's a feature request to be the checkbox "Delete nested projects" default state configurable as a preference option or the default state to be checked for hierarchical projects representation (in Project Explorer). 

Checked for hierarchical representation is for me a preferred and logical behavior.

PS: Delete nested projects feature was added in bug 525882 with default state unchecked in all cases.
