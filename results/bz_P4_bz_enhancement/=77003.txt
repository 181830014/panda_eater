Provide an option to show an overview pane.

This should be placed to the left of the wizard page container.

The overview pane would contain an ordered list of the wizard page titles.

This helps users to determine which steps have been completed and which are
still ahead.

Some nice-to-haves:

Surface the option to the end user -- hide/show button.

A background image.

Page title is a link -> opens the corresponding page; pages not visited yet
should not be clickable -- switch from page six to one in one click instead of
five (Next button clicks).
