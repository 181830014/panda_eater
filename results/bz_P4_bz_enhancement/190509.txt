Build ID: I20070525-1350

Steps To Reproduce:
My department is currently using dotProject. (which i.m.o. has one of the worst user interfaces I've been forced to use) It would be WONDERFUL to have a mylar connector to see/update those tasks from within eclipse rather than having to trudge through dotProject's web interface throughout the day.
