Actually Mylyn allows to create bug reports from error log entries. But sometimes there is a need to give feedback to recurring problems, and there is a need to paste log entries into existing bugs. See for example bug#188524.

Since log entries can have very long stack traces, I think it should be attached, so cc'd people don't get spammed.
