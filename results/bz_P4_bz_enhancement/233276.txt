I would like to see a standard layer to persist and retrieved objects, manage transaction, etc...
It would be easier for people to know that interface and would be easier for people to switch over CDO.

I thought about JPA. We already have an implementation that we could improve.

I'm open to any other implementation  ?

Any others suggestions ?
