I use the default Eclipse.org bug repository

Steps:
1) Open Task List, add a query to see some bugs
2) Modify summary of some bugs, save but don't submit

If I want to submit changes, I have to visit each task and submit it one-by-one . An option to submit all outgoing changes at once would be useful.
