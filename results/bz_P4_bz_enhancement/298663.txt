When a package is viewable in my context, but not the classes in that package or the "sub-packages" of that package, when I "Alt-click" on that package, it shows the classes in that package, but not the "sub-packages" of that package.  The only way (that I know of) to now see the "sub-packages" of that package is to go all the up to the root of the source tree and Alt-click that, then go back down into the packages to find the package I want.  When I have a wide and deep package tree, it's almost easier to just turn off the "Focus on Active Task" button for a bit.

What I really want to happen is for "Alt-click" on the package to not only show the classes in that package, but also the "sub-packages" of that package.

Reproducible: Always
