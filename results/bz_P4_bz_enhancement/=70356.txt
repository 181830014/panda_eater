I have a TableTreeViewer with a ComboBoxCellEditor in a column.
The ComboBoxCellEditor contents changes depending on selection in the table 
tree. With eclipse 3, selection change is taken into account after combo is 
expanded, so combo is not populated with expected content - worked in eclipse 2.

In eclipse 2 version of TableViewerImpl.handleMouseDown(MouseEvent event), 
following code ensured that mouse down event were actually not processed before 
selection ones:
if (tableItem != items[0]) {
	//This mouse down was a selection. Keep the selection and return;
	tableItem = items[0];
	return;
}
This piece of code is not present in eclipse 3: this makes the popup to be 
expanded sooner (which is fine too as it is more usable: in 2 you had to make 
two clicks: one for selection change and the other one to actually expand 
combo) but too soon as selection change has not been taken into account.
Possible to have both advantages: (selection change + expand) in one click ?
