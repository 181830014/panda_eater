Bug 483834 explains why the following code would currently not work as expected:

   for(IBlob blob : storage.getBlobs())
   {
   		blob.delete();
   }
   
As it might be a common use case for an application to simply reset all its remote state (i.e. remove all its blobs) it would be good to implement a DELETE ALL request, e.g., by making the "key" argument of the DELETE request optional.
