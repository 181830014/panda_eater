Right now editor support (e.g. JDT, CDT) is hard coded in to R4E UI code.  It should be decoupled and extracted into an extension point so that extensions can be easily written to support additionnal editors without having to change the UI code.  This include the Editor content and the IPosition interfaces.   JDT and CDT support extensions should also be written to keep existing functionality.
