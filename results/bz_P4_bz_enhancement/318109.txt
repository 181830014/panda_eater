Build Identifier: 20100617-1415

I have a project named "TestComp" in which I am building a JSF 2.0 custom component. TestComp defines a namespace for the taglib named "http://testcomp.com". I have another project named "TestJSF" that is a JSF 2.0 Dynamic Web 3.0 Project that depends on the TestComp project.

In other words, TestComp is added as a required project to the Java Build Path of TestJSF. Also, TestComp is added to the Web Deployment Assembly of TestJSF.

There's a web page in TestJSF that imports the "http://testcomp.com" namespace and uses the TestComp component. When running the project on Tomcat 7 everything works fine. However, in Eclipse a warning line is placed under xmlns:tc="http://testcomp.com" and Eclipse doesn't recognize the TestComp component in the page: <tc:testcomp... />.

However had I written the classes of TestComp in the TestJSF project and added the testcomp.taglib.xml to the WEB-INF of the TestJSF project instead of the META-INF of TestComp, Eclipse had no problem recognizing the namespace.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a project (Project1) that defines a JSF 2.0 custom component with a namespace like "http://foo.com"
2. Create a Dynamic Web 3.0 Project (Project2) with JSF 2.0 Facet and Mojarra libraries
3. Add Project1 to the build path of Project2
4. Add Project1 to the Web Deployment Assembly of Project 2
5. Create a Facelets XHTML page and try to import http://foo.com

6. Eclipse cannot recognize http://foo.com while the project works fine when deployed to Tomcat 7
