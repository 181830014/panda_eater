Sometimes, it happens that while working on one thing, user notices another easy-to-fix issue (e.g. NPE) and fixes it right away together with commit.

Usually, noone bothers opening a bug for such little change. This makes the change invisible to others, e.g. testers, or other developers (unless they're tracking all commits).

So it would be cool, if Mylyn could be used to create an issue in bugtracker and immediately mark it as fixed directly from commit dialog.
