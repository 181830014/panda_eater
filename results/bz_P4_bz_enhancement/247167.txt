It would be nice to have a bridge for the XSLT editor and Outline view that integrated with Mylyn's task focused API.   This would allow for the portions of the XML editor to be folded as well as focus the outline view based on the information provided by Mylyn.   This can be helpful when needing to see what files were affected, and what templates were updated or changed during the development of a particular bug.
