Mylar has enough information captured to determine when certain task has started and what files had been changed in a scope of that task.

One of the interesting option that can be implemented based on this information is the ability to create syncpoint and then roll back all changes made in the workspace back to syncpoint. Mylar could create syncpoint for the moment when task has been activated.

Possible strategies for rolling back or recovering changes:

-- use local history to take snapshots of the original files (problem is that it could be already wiped out from history)
-- use team plugins (e.g. replace with timed tag, create/apply patch, etc)

If I am not mistaken, Jazz have similar functionality implemented.
