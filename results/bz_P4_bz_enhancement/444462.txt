File → Export → Tasks → Task List and Contexts → "Export Mylyn Task Data" dialog has a preset file name, but requires the user to select a folder.
this folder can be selected by filechooser dialog only (althoug UI indicates that the field would be writable).
navigating through a filechooser for a path short or already at hand (clipboard) is rather cumbersome, please, make the file writable to allow users to insert it more efficiently.
