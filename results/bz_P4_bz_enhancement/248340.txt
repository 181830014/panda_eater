This is an "umbrella" item to provide a high-level overview and tracking of the enhancements in the extension registry.

For the initial list, there are several areas that we'd like to explore:

- Create user-specific objects based on the contents of the configuration elements (expanded version of the bug 221603)
- Expand ability to programmatically modify extension registry (see bug 174967, bug 127797)
- Add support for non-singleton bundles (see bug 108211)
- Add support for switching NLS locale without restart (related to the bug 244468)

The goal of this work is to see how we can improve usability of the extension registry. 

Restrictions:
- At least for 3.x streams we need to continue supporting pre-1.5 VMs. As such, any functionality based on annotations can only be used in an optional role

- Performance: while small performance hit can be expected every time a new functionality is added, the performance hit should be reasonable for the "minimum" headless framework start (say < 15% ?) and should scale well.
