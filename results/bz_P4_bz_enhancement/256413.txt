Build ID: N/A

I'd like to be able to compare attachemetments with each other. This is especially useful when dealing with patches that are almost identical and differ in few lines.

Sample scenario:
1. Someone attached a patch.
2. A committer reviews it, everything is OK beside date in javadoc.
3. The patch with new date is uploaded.

Result:
4. There is no way to tell what the difference between the patches is.
