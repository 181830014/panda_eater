I believe it will be very convenient feature to have kind of "fish eye" feature
for Eclipse views. Imagine that you can fold, shrink and expand each view... but
whithout dragging split bars between views. 

The idea behind this is that Eclipse should remeber sizes for active and passive
view state and change it authomatically when view is activated. Actually it
could be a good addition to a "Fast View" feature.

Other convenient improvement will be to allow to expand or shrink view size
without dragging its borders (e.g. use something like right-click-drag, or
ctrl-click-drag).
