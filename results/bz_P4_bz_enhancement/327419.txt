Looking at the "New and Noteworthy":http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy-Eclipse+2.1.0RC2+New+and+Noteworthy of the new Groovy-Eclipse plugin I saw also the section
"Extension point for proposal filtering and sorting"

bq. 
For Groovy DSL implementors, we have provided a new extension point for Groovy-Eclipse that allows third-party plugins to provide additional sorting and filtering for Groovy content assist. For more information, see the org.codehaus.groovy.eclipse.codeassist.completion.completionProposalFilter extension point in the org.codehaus.groovy.eclipse.codeassist.completion plugin.

Could this be of any use for Mylyn, e.g. to sort the proposal depending whether they are in the task context or not?
