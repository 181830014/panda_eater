From bug 210228 comment 4:

For remote server maintenance, particularly copying / moving stuff around, people would like to see a perspective similar to the good old norton commander / midnight 
commander / speed commander and similar clones: Two RSE Trees side by side.

A side-by-side (like the Compare view/editor) layout would be ideal. Can "Open in New View" be implemented so there's more than one Remote Systems view, like it's possible w/ multiple Search views?

Workaround: Right-click > Show in Table on destination folder, then drag&drop between tree and table; or, Right-click > Open in New Window, then drag&drop between the trees. Drawback is that both these approaches work on a single folder / single connection only.
