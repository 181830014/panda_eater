I have create screenshot of my source code.

I type code, set mouse pointer over keyword and see pop-up window. I have create this screenshot.
I open new task and press button "Capture". But... my mouse cursor no set over desired keyword.

And next propose. Add simple instruments to edit screenshot. Add lines, select desired element to red border and other. This always use testers for show bug on screenshot.
