The various IMP wizards have typically not allowed the user to select the template from which their respective service implementations are generated.  However, in support of user customization of service implementations, this might afford a significant degree of flexibility at a relatively modest cost.

There have previously been a couple of nods in this direction in specific wizards, namely the original JikesPG (now LPG) wizard and the New Preferences wizard, but the motivations in these cases were relatively specific to those wizards.

A more general concern is the problem of "round tripping", i.e., wanting to enable user modifications of previously generated code to be carried forward into subsequently generated code.  One way to do that is to enable previously generated and modified code to be used as the template for subsequently generated code.  Complete support for this might require some additional facilities, e.g., support for converting generated and modified back into a template, but just allowing the user to specify their own template, which might be based on their modified files, would be a step in this direction.

Apart from round tripping, users may just want to use their own custom templates, for whatever reasons.  They can do that now by replacing the given IMP templates, but it might be nice to allow them to incorporate their work without clobbering ours.
