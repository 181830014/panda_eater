To help assess features in Mylar, there is a need to collect data about how Mylar (and Eclipse) is used. This can be accomplished through a Mylar plugin that will a) provide a view to display information to a user about how he or she has been using Mylar and Eclipse and  b) provide a mechanism for users to easily submit their usage data to the Mylar and Eclipse teams.  I'm currently working on such a plugin. We are hopeful that the view will help convince users to submit their usage data.  We are looking for feedback on this enhancement request.

Specifically, we would like feedback on the following issues, although any comments will be appreciated. 

 1) What information would you like to see displayed in the view?  Some initial suggestions are a) the Eclipse views that you use most often b) number of tasks activated/deactivated/closed over the past week/weeks   c) the Mylar features that you used
 
 
2) If you have indicated that you would like to share your usage data, how and when would you like to be reminded to submit?  I'm looking into the interruption literature, but some initial ideas are   a) every X days, perhaps with a notification that can be ignored until you choose to address it   b) every X days, when you look at the view
