Background:

When not using Mylyn, I usually use hierarchical package presentation in the Package Explorer because it cuts down on clutter (ie. less nodes when under each source folder).

However, when a Mylyn task is active, hierarchical presentation has a lot of clutter (ie. multiple levels of nodes). This is especially the case when multiple classes are open, they lie in deeply nested packages, and those packages' only common ancestor is close to the top of the hierarchy.

To solve this, I can switch to the flat package presentation, and much of the clutter goes away (only one node for each package).

My request: 

Offer a Mylyn setting (a toggle) to automatically manage the package presentation as follows...

When "on", Mylyn will automatically make the package presentation flat when the "Focus on active task" is turned on (in the PE), but restore the package presentation to whatever the standard Eclipse/JDT setting is when either no task is active, or the "focus" is turned off.

When "off", things will be as they are today.
