I am tring to create a breakpoint in StructuredTextEditor vertical rule through menu context by configuring in plugin.xml
This is the piece of configuration I have written in xml.

To have menu option in StructuredTextEditor ruler.

<extension
         point="org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus">
      <viewerContribution
            id="debugtest.editor.rulerActions"
            targetID="org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui.StructuredTextEditor.RulerContext"> 
         <action
               class="org.eclipse.debug.ui.actions.RulerToggleBreakpointActionDelegate"
               id="debugtest.editor.ruler.toggleBreakpointAction"
               menubarPath="debug"
               label="Mapper Breakpoint"/>
      </viewerContribution>
   </extension>
To make StructuredTextEditor to take my breakpoint adapter.

<extension
         point="org.eclipse.core.runtime.adapters">
      <factory
            class="com.teamcenter.datamaper.mapperengineui.debug.ui.MapperEditorAdapterFactory" 
            adaptableType="org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui.StructuredTextEditor">
			<adapter type="org.eclipse.debug.ui.actions.IToggleBreakpointsTarget"/>
      </factory>
   </extension>

I am getting the popup option but it is not able to get my MapperEditorAdapterFactory and hence not my adapter. 

I have seen that StructuredTextEditor has its own implementation of breakpoint.If I want to use it what is the way to use it.
