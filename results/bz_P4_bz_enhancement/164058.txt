In my company we run into a problem when trying to adopt mylar. Several developers had the same project checked out in their workspaces with different project names. When one developer tried to retrieve the context of a task that was created by another developer it was completely useless because the project names were different and mylar was unable to find the relevant resources.
We thought that by renaming the project the task context would get updated but it doesn't.
So, i wish mylar was able to update the context files when the projects are renamed. 
Could this be also true for method and classes? Is mylar listening to refactoring events to appropriately update the context?
