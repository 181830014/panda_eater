As an EclipseCon attendee who reads about an interesting session on some blog, I want to be able and add that session to my calendar easily such that I remember going there and see early whether it conflicts with other sessions that I want to see.

Details:
It's pretty cool how I can create my own personal calendar by "starring" items on the Main Calendar; but if I find an interesting session through some other channel like the presenter's blog, I'm navigated to the Details view and not the main calendar.

Example:
When reading Max' blog on Planet Eclipse:
https://community.jboss.org/community/tools/blog/2013/03/22/jboss-tools-at-eclipsecon-and-devoxx

I was interested in this session which is linked from there:
http://eclipsecon.org/2013/sessions/google-analytics-eclipse-plugins

But I cannot add the session to my calendar immediately. I need to remember the time slot (Tue 11.15 in Federal), look that up on the main Calendar, then I can star it. 

This is way too inconvenient and should be improved !
