When navigating a chapter with a linear structure, such as Getting Started, or 
the tutorial, it would be helpful to have buttons for Next/Previous Topic.

In 2.0, individual pages added such links themselves, but these clutter the 
content, tend not to be applied consistently, and are difficult to maintain.

The Next/Previous Topic buttons should skip over any empty categories, and 
should keep the TOC in sync.
