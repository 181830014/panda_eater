Currently, a lot of the Git commiters use e-mail instead of an issue control system to store patches. (One possible reason is that there isn't a central issue database, unlike Eclipse where it's commonplace.) In any case, for whatever reason, patches-by-email has become the defacto standard of operation.

One feature of this, over an issue tracker item, is the ability to quote the patch itself to rebut certain changes or suggestions. This sounds like the kind of thing that Mylyn could easily do, given that it has access to the attachments associated with a task, and that 'reply' has already been a part of replying to other comments. It should be possible, therefore, to reply-quote the latest patch, at leats iniitally to get the dialog going. Other Eclipse committers might find such functionality useful as well.
