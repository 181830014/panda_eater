I like my code to be formatted like that exampleFunction( arg1, arg2, arg3 ) however a bracket containing a single string or number should look like this ("Hello World") or (4). Also concatenated strings should have an option for spaces before and after the double dot. It would be neat if that were configurable and auto-formattable, also please add the same settings for square brackets since I and probably some other people prefer having different formatting for them.
