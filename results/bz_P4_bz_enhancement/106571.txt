It would be nice if you could move a static method to a new class instead of
just moving it to a pre-existing one.

As of right now 3.1 just let's me browse for a type or type a type's name in. 
It would be nice if I could type in the name of a non-existing type and have it
be created.

If this was allowed there should be a notification on the prompt that it was
going  to move the method to a new class (that would be created) to avoid people
mistyping class names.
