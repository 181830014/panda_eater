Steps To Reproduce:
1. close all the files in the edit window of an activated task
2. deactivate the task
3. activate the task, the last open file is reopened in the editor pane

This is very annoying especially when the last open file involves initialising some heavy plugin.
When I close all open files and then deactivate the task, I want the editor pane to be empty when I reactivate the task again.
