very often queries are just: see my tickets, see the ticktes where i am in cc, and this is the same for all trac repositories i participate. creating such queries is much more tedious than necessary currently. one cannot specify one query executed towards multiple repositories, one cannot clone a query and just "change" the repository to point to another one, nor can one copy paste a query onto antoher repository.
