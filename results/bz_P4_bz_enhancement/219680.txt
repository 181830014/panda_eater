Some properties are automatically updated during repository validation, e.g. the character encoding for JIRA. It would be helpful to give the user feedback which fields have changed. This could be done by changing the background color of the affected controls like in the task editor or using the ControlDecoration API introduced in Eclipse 3.3. The latter would also make it possible to add a tooltip with additional information in regard to the results of the validation.
