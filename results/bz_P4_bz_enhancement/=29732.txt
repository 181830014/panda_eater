I ran into a situation where I had unsaved work in an editor when Eclipse got 
hung and I lost the work because I had to kill Eclipse. It would be nice if the 
Eclipse editors had an auto-save facility that would write the changes to disk 
without saving them in the edited file. This could even be tied into the 
workspace snapshot mechanism or triggered by the lose of focus of an editor.
