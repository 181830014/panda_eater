Hello everyone,
I found some extension points without documentation and correct definition when i try do any simple bridge to PDT.

All given extension points don't have an description and information. We have Eclipse wiki but schema documentation gone.
org.eclipse.mylar.monitor.ui.user - no description
org.eclipse.mylyn.context.core.bridges
org.eclipse.mylyn.context.core.study - no description, attributes questionnairePage and backgroundPage defined as type Java but haven't base type (maybe it's not bug, i don't know).
org.eclipse.mylar.context.ui.bridges - no description, attribute lavelProvider is type java but haven't base class/interface.
