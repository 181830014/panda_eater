Here is my case:
I've just moved all my .mylyn data scattered across multiple workspaces to a single directory by changing the Data directory on the Task pref page and importing bunch of queries. What I realized after doing so is that I lost all private notes while exporting queries (usually they're rubbish but some of them contained work-in-progress patches). I had to switch back to the original .mylyn folder (per workspace) copy the note and then switch again to the shared data directory.
