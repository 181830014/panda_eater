If I don't have npm installed or part of the PATH, then trying to run `npm install` from menu fails with the error `npm command not found`.
It would be nice to catch this error and suggest user to configure NPM runtimes (open the preference page if relevent), or even to open a "install npm" wizard to download/install/configure the application.
