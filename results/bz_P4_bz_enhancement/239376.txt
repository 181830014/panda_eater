For more than 4 years now, we've been using the following commit comment convention in (at least) both the EMF and XSD projects: [123456] Comment.  '123456' is the bugzilla number and 'Comment' is a text that describes what has been done to a file or how the bugzilla was fixed/implemented.  In other words, usually 'Comment' is not the bugzilla description.

Would it be possible to change the "Bugzilla hyperlink detector" to support this pattern?

This is the newsgroup post where this feature was first discussed:

An extra bit: sometimes a given fix applies to more than one bugzilla.  In this case, after typing the comment related to the first bugzilla, we add a line break and enter a new bug comment (ie, [123457] Comment2). Would this scenario be supported?
