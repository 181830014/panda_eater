'Planning' page of a task should contain table with the task intervals being spent. If task is now active, interval should have "Now working" or something like this in the last "finished" field.

Possible fields:

+---------------+--------------+-------+--------------------------------------+
| Started       | Finished     | Spent |          Most time spent on          |
+---------------+--------------+-------+--------------------------------------+
| May 27 10:30  | May 27 14:31 | 04:01 | Debugging 63%, Typing 15%, Sleeping..|
| May 27 14:53  | Now working  | 01:05 | Typing 30%, Browsing 24%, Mylar 9%,..|
+---------------+--------------+-------+--------------------------------------+

Hey, it's a joke about the last field :)
