It would be highly useful if CheatSheets (and other Eclipse facilities) 
could exercise more programmatic control over Wizards.  In particular it would
be nice to have API's allowing one to:

1) provide default values for all values gathered by the Wizard
2) receive notification of changes to any values gathered by the Wizard
3) take exactly the action the Wizard would have cause to occur without invoking
the Wizard (note, clearly the information the Wizard would have gathered from
the user must be provided).
