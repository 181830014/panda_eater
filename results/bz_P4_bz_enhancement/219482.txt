Sometimes you are added as cc in some task because someone wants to bring you attention (like just happened to me in bug#219171).

But the problem is that I already am subscribed into some query that includes that task.

We need some visual indication in task list to emphasize incoming tasks that are directed to you, regardless of you were already monitoring it, where "directed to you" would mean:

- You were added as cc.
- You were assigned to it.
- You were assigned to QA.

Maybe a simple indication like a double dark blue arrow, instead of the traditional light blue arrow, should work.
