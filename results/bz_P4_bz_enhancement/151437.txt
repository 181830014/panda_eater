It would be very nice if Mylar could automatically retrieve "Saved searches" and show them as queries in the Task List. In addition, it would be nice if one could export a query in the Task List as a "Saved Search".

If one uses bugzilla from many computers, it is very useful to be able to define queries that are saved on the server. This allows one to avoid having to manually synchronize these when moving computers.

Thanks for the great plug-in and keep it up. :)
