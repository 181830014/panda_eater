preference  file that breaks content assist when imported into fresh install, fresh workspace

I've no idea that's what's happening. but ... something weird is going on. I
started this with bug 296989, closed as 'works for me' bug implied maybe it was
because Mylyn did something, and then Mylyn was no longer installed. 

Chronological order: working with workspace on Galileo SR1 (plus updates) works
fine. But, then I created a partial dev. environment with recent I build (not
including mylyn) and Java Content Assist no longer works -- with that
workspace. It works with a fresh workspace. 

I then exported my full set of preferences from old workspace, and imported
them into new workspace. Now, using the new dev. environment (without mylyn)
the Java Content assist stopped working! 

What was in those preferences? Java Content Assist works in old, and works in
new .... until I import those prefernces. That would be, roughly, the same as
working with the old workspace on new install. 

Dani says he doesn't see it, but suspect Mylin might be involved, so thought
I'd open a bug here, and maybe you all can spot what preferences are
responsible for "turning off" Java Proposals. When Mylin is installed, do you
all turn off Java Proposals? And have your own, or something? If so, you can
see the problem ... you break JDT when you are no longer present.
