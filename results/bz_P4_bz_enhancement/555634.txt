Updated support:

Current support assumes that calls to protected resources made by a
given task X are made just after the call activating task X itself, so
e.g.: 
            	
message n째1:task1 activation
message n째2..x: list of protected resources used by task1
message n째x+1: activation of task2
message n째x+2..y: list of protected resources used by task2
etc
