Some times there is a need to have attribute mappings and other properties set during the creation of a repository. 
However some of these settings might be dependant on choices made earlier in the creation process and would optimally be put in a subsequent page in the creation wizard. As it is now you need to have these mappings in foldable sections on the same page. This is less than optimal from a user experience perspective.
