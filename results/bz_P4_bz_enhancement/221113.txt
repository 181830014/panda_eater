Build ID: M20080221-1800

As suggested by Eugene Kuleshov in Mylyn newsgroup, I'm requesting an enhancement for providing a JTrac (http://jtrac.info) template for Mylyn Web Connector.

Unfortunately, in fact, the author of JTrac was not able to provide a connector for Mylyn, as written in JTrac forums:
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1675418&forum_id=552477

So, at least a template for the generic web connector would be useful.

Unfortunately, there's no public installation available for testing, although JTrac installation should be an easy task.

Thank you.
