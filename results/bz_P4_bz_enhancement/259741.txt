Build ID: Eclipse 3.4 Build id: I20080207-1530

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Open Eclipse 3.4 and above that has projects with many Java classes
2. Open type dialog using Ctrl+Shift+T
3. Use "*" only for the pattern match. -- Nothing happens
4. Use "?" only for the pattern match -- The cache is refreshed with the list.
The bug is that wildcard "*" doesn't trigger the search to refresh the cache.



More information:
This regression is seen from Eclipse 3.3 where in class "org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaUI" method "createTypeDialog", the class "org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.dialogs.FilteredTypesSelectionDialog" is used instead of "TypeSelectionDialog2".
