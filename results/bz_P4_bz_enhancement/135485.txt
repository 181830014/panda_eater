Some XML validation tools provide a way to explicitly specify the schema (XSD) that goes with a particular instance (XML) document, even if none is specified or the specified one is wrong.  That can be useful in certain situations, including:

1.  The file belongs to someone else and you want to make minimal changes to it (suppose for example I consider historical plan files from MER in Rover Markup Language to be read-only and want to experiment with schema changes and ensure they are backward compatable), and the schema path in the file is
  (a) missing, or
  (b) an absolute or relative pathname that exists in the intended environment but is difficult to set up in your development environment.
  (c) outdated (e.g. it may contain a version number and I'm experimenting with a new one)

2.  The schema path is correctly specified but is not honored by WTP for some reason (such as Bug 133093).
