For the File > New wizard, I think it would be useful to include category names in the filtered search, so that a category will be shown if it matches the filter, even if none of it's children do.
For example, if I type "Example" in filter field, (in my build) nothing shows up, because there are no wizards with example in the label, but there is an entire category of example wizards, which would be useful to know.  

I think the preferred way of doing this would be to include the category and all it's children in the results.  All wizards (and categories) that match will be shown in bold, the others would be listed in normal type.  (This is similar to preferences filter, where items that don't match filter are shown, but not in bold).

You could also just show the category in the results (no children), and you could get to the children by selecting the category, then clearing the filter (but this isn't as usable).
