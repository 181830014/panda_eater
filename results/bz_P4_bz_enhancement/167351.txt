Eclipse Build ID: M20060921-0945
Mylar version: 0.9.2.2

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Find a repository that has comments added to the bug when commits are made against the bug (e.g. Bugzilla with SCMbug)
2. Make commits against tasks from that repository.
3. Observe that you must manually refresh the task after committing.

Our installation of SCMbug forces committers to specify a valid bug number when committing changes to the source, and then it automatically mirrors the SVN commit message into a comment on the bug.  It would be nice if Mylar had a setting wherein it would auto-sync the task when commits are made against that task -- currently, this must be done by hand to avoid clashes later.
