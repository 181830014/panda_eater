For our links to checksums, we normally want them coded as absolute link to "download.eclipse.org" .... not a relative link. The reason for this is so that if someone gets a download from a mirror site, they would still get checksum from "download.eclipse.org" ... providing a proper check of original checksum. 

But, at the same time, if doing a 'test build' (that stays on "build.eclipse.org") or if someone is using our build elsewhere, say "LTS servers", then the checksums would be an absolute link to those servers. 

Hence, we should make the links variable, that can be set and or modified upon "promotion" to else where ... or, perhaps a possible alternative, compute them afresh, once they are on downloads server? 

I consider this a "minor" priority, since, after all, "downloads.eclipse.org" is what really matters, and the checksums are always retrievable, say from "build.eclipse.org" ... a person would just have to know what "location" to use in their script, it would not be quite so automatic.
