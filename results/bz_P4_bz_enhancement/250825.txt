We want to use BIRT to make documents such as investment statements and letters that are to be printed and then sent to our clients.

In our context, we would make a big report containing all the letters and the statements content as detail rows in a table, using groups and headers to control the page breaks.  The report will be saved in a postscript file, and then sent directly to our printer.

Some business processes of ours require us to add premade documents (such as generic letters and disclaimers) to some clients in addition to the "normal" documents.  This part is already working for other jobs and we don't want to duplicate the content of these letters, so creating a BIRT report is out of the question, as sometimes we do not even control the creation of these letters.

As such it would be nice to be able to "attach" a premade document in a table row.  In my context it would be a PDF or a postscript file, so I would see it as an attachment of the same type of document produced with the emitter (attach a HTML file when producing an HTML document, a PDF when using the PDF emitter...)

I initially thought of creating a scripted dataset to add the content of the pdf as an image, but I would prefer to add the PDF directly.
