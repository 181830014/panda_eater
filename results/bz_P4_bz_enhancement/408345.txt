I am using luadocumentor-0.1.1-3702b84c5d-64bits.zip .

I am developing a Lua module which has a Lua source file and C source file.
The API functions are spread between the two files.
I'd like to have the Luadoc of each function the closest to the source code implementing the API.

Each file contains "@module foo".
Used separately, each source file can used to generate valid Luadoc.
If I set luadocumentor to use both source files, only the Lua source file Luadoc content is put in html result file.


It would be even better to be able to use several C files and several Lua files to create the doc of a Lua module using luadocumentor.
