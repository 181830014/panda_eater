For 2.0 a number of bundles and features were modified to minimize the dependencies on heavy SDK packages. However, the typical download page still lists 4 SDKs as required. It would be good to narrow the prerequisites as much as possible. For example: does the WST runtime require DTP or even the entire Eclipse SDK? Maybe the runtime version of these packages is be enough.
