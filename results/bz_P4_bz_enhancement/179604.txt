When filtering the Package Explorer view using the context for the currently active task, I'd like to be able to right-click on an element and select "Show Changes."  Mylar would find the CVS version corresponding to the task id, and open a Compare Version window that compares that version with the previous one.  This would allow the user to quickly go through the context to see exactly what was changed.
