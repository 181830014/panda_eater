It will be helpfull if the debugger can stop automatically just before an error occurs as the Java debugger can stop on Exceptions.

For example, the following code throw an error on runtime:
1. local a= {}
2. c = a.b
3. print(c)

The debugger may stop on the second line because as a usual breakpoint, and the user should be able to see that the "b" key doesn't exist is the table "a".
