Support for the Texlipse plugin would be nice. http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/
The technical specification for the plugin can be found here http://switch.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/texlipse/texlipse-techspec-1.0.0.pdf

The package net.sourceforge.texlipse.model contains the model, interesting classes to look at when implementing the structure bridge would be TexDocumentModel and OutlineNode in said package.
