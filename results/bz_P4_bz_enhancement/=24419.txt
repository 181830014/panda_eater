Build 20021001

1. Add the filetype "*.*" to the editor association preference page
2. Add the editor "Text Editor" for this filetype.
3. Double-click a file named blah.xml.
4. Instead of launching the text editor, a system editor is opened.

If the filetype *.* is entered, any file which doesn't have a more specific 
association mapping should use the editor associated with *.*

Background rant:
Eclipse's default behavior for unknown filetypes is to open a "System 
editor" on it. For me (a command-line Linux user), this amounts to a 
"Random editor". I don't ever want Eclipse launching an external program 
unless I explicitly tell it to.
