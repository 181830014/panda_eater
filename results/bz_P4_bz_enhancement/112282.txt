The XML editor graph view contains a very useful view of the information in an
XML document and is preferable, in my eyes, to working in the XML source view.
The view breaks down in authoring situations such as using DITA or DocBook when
large text children are required. In this case the XML graph view scrolls a
single line of text. This makes it very difficult to use the view.

I'd like to suggest an enhancement where the editor remains as is by default
but, when the mouse hovers over the text the section is expanded allowing the
complete contents to be edited. (This can also be implemented by a button option
or some other mechanism, the mouse hover is just a suggestion.)
