The support that synchronizing Mylar change sets provides is excellent, as far as annotating commit logs with the task ID.  However, it'd be nice to close the loop on this and have synchronizing the Mylar change set also move the bug to "fixed" and annotate the report with a template that could include the source repository revision number(s).  Even if this isn't the default behavior (to allow multiple commits for the same task), it'd be really nice if it was an option when completing a task.  Right now, we have to append manually the SVN revision number to the Bugzilla bug report for posterity.
