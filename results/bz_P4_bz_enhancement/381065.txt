The KDM Inventory Model Discoverer  creates inventory elements (SourceFile, Directory, ...) with some absolute file path as "path" attribute value.

It will be useful to allow to keep only relative paths to one "root" directory indicated as one new parameter "ROOT_RELATIVE_FILE" of the "kdm.source" discoverer.
This will allow to interpret the computed model on other file system, in indicating some new root path to the files set.

Exemple :

if one windows file path is "C:/a/b/c/myfile", and if the new given parameter value is set to "C:/a/b" directory, the SourceFile instance for myfile would be "/c/myFile" or may be "%ROOT_PATH"/c/myFile".



Note : KDM OMG specification does not constrain the content of the "path" attribute : « The path attribute should uniquely identify the physical artifact. The nature of the path attribute is outside of the scope of the KDM. For example, this can be a URI. ».
