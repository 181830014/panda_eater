hi

enclosed are 2 screen shots for the qc mylyn connector 

as you can see the right to left orientation, is ok, however it also reverses the entire layout of eclipse with makes it impossible to work and develop, but, right to left layout is excellent for hebrew and asian interface. so we need to be able to define an orientation for mylyn framework alone.

this is the same issue as in the hebrew locelized windows version, such a version has the entire UI right to left oriented, and exists as a sperate product, while the regular windows version, allows for hebrew input but contains LTR layout.
