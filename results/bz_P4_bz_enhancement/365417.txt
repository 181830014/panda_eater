When performing a review, I noticed a file in a review which is supposed to be different from the file in my workspace. If I open the file from the review, I cannot modify the file. If I open the file from the workspace I am able to modify, but I would like to compare the file in the workspace with the file under the review to see what is different between the file in the workspace and the file in the review. Right now, I cannot compare those two files
