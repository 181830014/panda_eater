minor improvement could be made in "promote" scripts, so eclipse and equinox were separate -- that is, could be invoked independently, where as now promote-build.sh creates the jobs to promote both. But, if only equinox needs to be "re-promoted", (in the event of rare error during promotion) then we do not want Eclipse to be re-promoted ... since that one also would re-trigger the unit tests. 

(This was noticed when "re-promoting equinox" for bug 433582 comment 3 ... and in that case I just commented out the few lines of code that "promote eclipse")
