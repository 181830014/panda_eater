Iterating over the blobs of an application involves multiple requests with "pagesize" and "page" arguments. These arguments kind of expect that the no blobs are added or removed for the duration of the iteration.

I opened this bug to discuss whether that's just accepted or whether we want a more reliable approach to blob iteration...
