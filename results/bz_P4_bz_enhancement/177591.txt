When I create a new query all hits are marked as incoming and a notification window pops-up. This does not provide any useful information for me since I explicitly created the query and I'm aware that I have not read any of the tasks. Moreover I can see that I have not downloaded the task due to the missing task data icon so the same information is displayed twice.

I suggest that hits for newly created queries are not marked as incoming.
