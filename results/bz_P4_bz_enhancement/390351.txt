The inline markers (icons) that are supposed to be displayed in the left-sode annotation rules are invisible when we use multi-page editors, such as the ManifestEditor.  This was observed in the PDEProjectionViewer.  Ir seems that it doesn't use the AnnotationRuleColumn, as other editor seems to be doing for annotations.  This needs investigation.
