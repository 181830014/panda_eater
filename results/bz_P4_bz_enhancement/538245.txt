I'm using launch to debug step by step my XML Language Server which is very helpfull. Now I would like to initialize options when the server starts (to configure formatting and XML catalogs), but today it's not possible to fill this options (we cannot override LaunchConfigurationStreamProvider#getInitializationOptions because LaunchConfigurationStreamProvider is created by lsp4e).

I have not a solution for the moment, but it should be cool if we could bind a custom LaunchConfigurationStreamProvider to use with a launch.
