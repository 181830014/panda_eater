When an AspectJ project has an output JAR specified, and it is generated, it appears in the package explorer with the text file icon, and responds to a double mouse click, or the 'Open' command, by opening in the text editor (!).

What it should do is behave in the same way as a JAR file added to the Java Build Path, on the 'Libraries' tab.  In this scenario, the added JAR appears in package explorer with the correct icon, a + which expands the JAR's contents, and it responds to a double mouse click by opening the JAR to show the first level of contents, just as when opening a folder or package.
