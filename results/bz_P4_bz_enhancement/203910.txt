Not sure if it is something with my setup or something common, but I find it quite inconvenient to browse png attachments from the task editor. There is no editor in Eclipse that can show png or other images, and it fall to the opening those in the web browser editor, which shows "Action canceled" message, then shows "File Download" dialog for the png attachment and then opens OS-default external image browser. Interestingly, if I refresh that "Action Canceled" web browser, png gets loaded there.

I suggest to add simple editor that would allow to view images from the attachments (as well as other places). Since it is a useful feature for Mylyn workflow and Platform folks aren't planning to support it. See bug 155323
