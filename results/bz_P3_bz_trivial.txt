Historically, GNU ld was just outputting the active mode when running with tracing (-t) enabled, but in commit 5c87f94bb85e5b8e715aa7f947ecc602960f20ee, they changed the line to be outputted using the verbose (-v) flag instead.
As there is a catch-all pattern last for the linker, this line would be handled as an error rather than handling it as info or ignoring the line completely.

Example line:
/usr/bin/ld: mode elf_x86_64
