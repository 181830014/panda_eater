VSM exposing the self type issue.

On Node and Container creation tools: the initial inferred value of var:self for the first model operation should be the same than var:container (See TaskHelper.buildTaskFromModelOperation callers)

To reproduce: 
 . expand in ShouldBeValid section
 . in "Check Node variables types are infered"
   . ChangeContext var:self
     . ChangeContext var:self -> add a ChangeContext featureOwnedInteractions (like the var:container)

 . in "Check variables types with multiple self types"
   . ChangeContext var:self
     . ChangeContext var:self -> add a ChangeContext featureOwnedInteractions (like the var:container)

 . validate the section: the inferred type for self should be Model and not Interaction/Particant with the resulting "no ownedInteractions feature" validation error  error.
