When invoking a rename of a model element in the model explorer with F2, a dialog appears. This dialog cannot be confirmed with enter. Neither can you tab out of the text control. Thus, you have to switch to the mouse to hit OK.

Interestingly, it works well when invoking the rename using the popupmenu with the mouse.

Maybe this only occurs in Linux GTK2.
