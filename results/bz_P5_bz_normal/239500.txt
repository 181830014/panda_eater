Tried to rename TopLink foundationm examples (found @ http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/ias/toplink/examples/index.html)

examples\toplink\examples\foundation\non-relational\ox\src contains a property file jaxb.properties - it was ignored by renamer.

The file contains a single line:
  javax.xml.bind.context.factory=oracle.toplink.ox.jaxb.JAXBContextFactory
and should be converted.
