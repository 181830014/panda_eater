Many of the JPA tests are create the database in a setUp method instead of the suite setup.  This is not good because this is done for EVERY test.  There are also a few tests that read in the entire database and compare everything with the start of the test and then recreate the database if anything changed.

This should not be done, unless a really good reason, perhaps the modify-all tests could do this, but other should just assume things are ok, especially the read-only tests.

Suite setup method should just be a normal testSetup() test method that is run at start of suite (named tests, no auto) to be compatible with server tests.
