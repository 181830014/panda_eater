Since I updated my target platform to the latest version in Juno, I am getting a dozen errors each time I right click (see attached file).

The stacktrace doesn't give much indication as to the source, but I see with the debugger that the BundleFile for each error is:
<myTargetPlatform>\plugins\org.eclipse.emf.facet.widgets.nattable.workbench_0.2.1.v201209110754.jar

I don't know why it's looking for JFace images in this bundle, but the images are certainly not in there.
