1) Create a working set org.eclipse.swt that is only org.eclipse.swt
2) Open Type Hierarhchy on org.eclipse.swt
3) Select the class 'Control'
4) Select the method 'getEnabled'
5) Select the class 'Control' again
6) Popup the context menu for the methods pane over 'getEnabled'
7) Select 'References'->'org.eclipse.swt'
8) Search searches on 'Control' rather than 'Control.setEnabled'

NOTE: Does not happen on Windows.  When a popup menu is activated on GTK, the 
parent shell loses focus and is deactivated (depending on the window 
manager).  This doesn't happen on Windows.  Could be part of the trouble?
