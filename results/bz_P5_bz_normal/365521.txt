At the moment, plugin org.eclipse.emf.facet.infra.query.ui depends on org.eclipse.jdt.core and org.eclipse.jdt.ui.
The problem is that even if one does not need defining new Java queries at run-time, the JDT still has to be embarked in the target platform for EMF/Facet to run.
This is a bit annoying.
Maybe that part (UI for Java-based query creation) should belong in its own optional plugin that could be omitted from the target platform if not needed.
