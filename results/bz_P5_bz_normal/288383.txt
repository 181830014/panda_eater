In investigating our Spring tests and trying to get all JPA tests running on Spring, I noticed several issues:

- Spring temp class loader excludes org.eclipse.persistence, oracle., this means any EclipseLink test/example using these packages will not weave/work.
- Spring ignores exclude-unlisted-classes=false (makes true), the only way to make false is to remove the element entirely.
- Spring cannot find jar-file elements on the classpath unless the directory the jars are in are also on the classpath.
