Window->Preferences--Workbench

There are a couple of preferences that are hard to interpret:

1) Always run in background
    ... Always run WHAT in the background?
    - the Workbench? (after all, this is the Workbench preference page)
    - the build? (but build always runs in the background...)
    - programs? (after all, it's an ide... <g>)
    - long-running operations? (if that's it, please say so...)


2) Refresh workspace automatically
    ... Refresh workspace automatically WHEN?
    - every couple of minutes?
    - after a build?
    - after something runs?
