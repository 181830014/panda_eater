For my work in Papyrus, I need to access to the command used to hide columns : TableInstanceCommandFactory.createHideColumnCommand
Please, could you open your API for us?
Currently this command takes as arguments : 
	final TableWidgetController widgetController -> I don't have access to it, but it is possible to replace it by 2 arguments : EditingDomain and Table
		it is used too for final FacetOperation isVisibleProperty = widgetController.getCustomPropertiesHandler().getIsVisible();
		-> you will need to provide a new way to get this object...
	final Collection<FeatureColumn> featureColumns -> it is OK, but if it is possible, I will prefer a Collection of features to hide

Best regards,
