After the discovery of Java and Inventory models, we get the main model (JavaApplication), however the resource set doesn't "contains" the resource of Java model (*.javaxmi).

If you use a query that use the resource set to link a java element with a source element (like class GetASTNodeSourceRegion), you get a different behaviour from one inside MoDisco browser.
