I have the Problems view minimized.

I have filtered turned on so it only shows me things of ERROR severity.

Frequently the table of the view is in bold face, indicating that something in
the view has changed. But when I open the view, nothing is new because my filter
doesn't show it.

The view bold face font should only happen when there are actual changes to the
view with the filter being applied.
