build I20050331-0800

- on startup after switching to the new build, it was busy building, refreshing
CVS etc
- turned on the pref to show system and sleeping jobs in the Progress view
- it was -very- jumpy and flashy, with items changing order between refreshes,
and occasionally flashing blank even though some jobs were still running (e.g
the build)

For the order of items, I suspect they're getting refreshed in "hash map order".

Should try updating the view incrementally, with jobs ordered from oldest to newest.
