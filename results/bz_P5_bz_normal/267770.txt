One of our applications had a strange problem recently:
while using the entity MyEntity, we got a

java.lang.VerifyError: (class: MyEntity, method: setMyField signature: (Z)V) Expecting to find integer on stackThe problem is this piece of code

The application is deployed on OCJ4 10.1.3.4, and uses Eclipselink as delivered by Toplink 11.1.1.0.1.
We narrowed the problem to the following situation

@Entity
@Table(name = "MY_TABLE")
public MyEntity {
  private Boolean myField;

  @Column(name = "MY_FIELD")
  public boolean getMyField() {
    return myField;
  }

  public boolean setMyField(boolean myField) {
    this.myField = myField;
  }

As you can see, the myField is defined as Boolean object while the getter/setter methods use primitives. By changing myField to a primitive, the error disappeared.
