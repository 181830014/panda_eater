The dialogs provided by JFace use the defualt font from SWT to define thier 
dialog unit size and the size and font of many of the buttons.

On some Motif platforms it is not unusual for these fonts to be very small. Two 
things need to be done

1) Test with an .xdefaults file that sets this font for eclipse and check that 
that is OK
2) In the 3.0 timeframe add a Dialog Font to the list of fonts and use that for 
this propagated font.

Grant please advise on who to construct an Xdefaults file.
