Last night, I discovered Bug 91806 on my box.  It only occurs on Linux boxes,
and it happens because the icon path name contains a backslash.  I'm not sure
whether this is a recent change in how bundle look-ups work, or has existed
since the beginning of time.

While it was good that we caught this bug in Stefan's code, it's bad that we're
testing different code paths on different platforms.

I recommend: (a) checking that this isn't regression in core; and (b) making
sure that the path names are platform agnostic.
