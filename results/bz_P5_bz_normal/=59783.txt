When the workbench window is minimized, the shell gets resized to 0,0.  But 
then all of the parts and editors inside the workbench get resized to 0,0 as 
well.  This is expensive for areas in GEF such as the palette and also HTML 
editors where wordwrapping and expensive layout calculations must be done for 
a completely temporary and invisible state.  When the workbench is restored, 
the parts are sized back to their previous size.  But for some reason, we 
getting double WM_SIZE callbacks on our canvas with the sizes being 
identical.  I'm not sure who is at fault there.

This is a significant performance problem.  If the user has 5 HTML editors 
open, then there will be 20 expensive layouts when the window is restored to 
full size (5 editorparts X (editor + palette) X double notification of RESIZE).

The workbench window should not layout its children when the shell becomes 
minimized.  When restored, the layout could be suppressed, or optimized so 
that setting controls to their current bounds does not notifiy RESIZE events.
