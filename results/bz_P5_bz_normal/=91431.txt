Two dialogs appear on top of one another when closing a modified text file that 
has been deleted.  The steps to reproduce follow:

1. Switch to resource perspective.
2. Create a text file.
3. Modify the text file but don't save.
4. Delete the text file from the Resource Navigator view.
5. Press the X button on the editor part tab to close the editor.
6. Two dialogs appear - Save Resource to confirm that you want to 
save a modified resource and File Deleted that asks if you want to 
save the deleted file or close without saving.  

If you press No on the Save Resource and then press Save on the 
File Deleted dialog, the file is not saved.  This is confusing and 
could lead to unintentional data loss.
