While looking around with the SWT spy plugin, we noticed that there are many
Composites created as parents for toolbars which seem to be there to optimize
layout operations.  SWT now supports cached layout: can these be removed?  It
seems that optimizations in this area should be done at the SWT level, as
creating extra Composite widgets when they are not necessary is itself a likely
performance issue.

Examples:
  - Every toolbar in the coolbar seems to have a composite parent
  - There seems to be two extra cache composites surrounding the perspective
    switcher
  - The CBanner seems to have a parent which is there for caching purposes
