Bugzilla in its latest version changed the schema of a 'CloneOf' field [1]. It's no longer a free text, but it became a bug ID.

That change effectively broke all tasks already existing in my workspace - any attempt to change a task results in an error message:

"not allowed: You tried to changeClone Of field from0 ,but only a user with the required permissions may change that field."

This affect only bugs that were already on my task list. I suspect that mylyn cached some value and is now unable to react to the schema change.
