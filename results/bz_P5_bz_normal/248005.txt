The way ReturningPolicy is implemented limits the utility of the @ReturnInsert and @ReturnUpdate to the Oracle DB (which has a RETURNING clause that can be appended to an INSERT and UPDATE).  

On databases lacking the equivalent of an Oracle RETURNING clause we should SELECT the updated fields identified by @ReturnInsert and @ReturnUpdate in a separate statement.

That would allow the following to work with any database platform:

@Entity
public class Employee implements Serializable {
	   
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue
	private int id;
	@ReturnInsert
	@ReturnUpdate
	private String firstName;
	@ReturnInsert
	@ReturnUpdate
	private String lastName;
...
