This is BiDi specific defect

1. Start defining Derby profile
2. Use following string for JDBC URL (capital characters stay for BiDi chars)
    jdbc:derby:c:\derbydatabases\ABC\_123\Aa\MyDB;create=true

Results: The text appear as follows:
   jdbc:derby:c:\derbydatabases\A\123_\CBAa\MyDB;create=true

Expected results: The text should appear as follows:
   jdbc:derby:c:\derbydatabases\CBA\_123\Aa\MyDB;create=true


  The relative order of file path components in JDBC URL field make it impossible to understand the real location of the file.
  Notice, that the database file is created correctly in the correct path. The only problem we have is with the display of this path in the GUI.
