Build Identifier: 20110916-0149

The present bug shows a problem with the java discoverer "org.eclipse.modisco.java.project".

When the discovery process is launched several times (within the discoverer benchmark see Bug 369945), the obtained size obtained for the resulting java model increase at each iteration.

The content of the model is "duplicated" in each iteration.
 
There is probably a static field in the java discoverer that keeps some link to the model elements produced before.

Example:
- first iteration, 50 ko (all model elements appears once),
- second iteration, 100 ko (all model elements appears twice),
- third iteration, 150 ko (all model elements appears three times),...

A project with a launch configuration to reproduce the bug will be attached.
The discovery is launched on the "org.eclipse.gmt.modisco.dev.core" project

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. make sure you have the benchmark discoverer installed
2. import the "org.eclipse.gmt.modisco.dev.core" project
3. import the project in attachment
4. run the launch configuration contained in the project
