We need to better define the behaviour of #nodeExists for the nodes in the
project scope.

Currently we over-ride super-class impl such that the node does exist if the
super-class says that it does or if you are at /project and you are asking about
a single segment name and that name is the name of a project that exists in the
workspace.

The impl doesn't work for long paths though since super accesses the cache of
children. (e.g. nodeExists("myProject/qualifier/nodeName")

Investigate the interaction between #nodeExists and #getChild, #getChildren, and
#childnames.
