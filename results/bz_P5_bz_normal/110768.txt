If a Working Set is updated programmatically e.g. using the IResourceNavigator
setWorkingSet() method, the MRU list in the WorkingSetFilterActionGroup is not
correctly displayed as it's setWorkingSet() method has not been called. 

The fill() method on WorkingSetMenuContributionItem fails as it's comparing with
actionGroup.getWorkingSet() that has not been updated. The result is that the
selected attribute is not in sync with the working set currently in use.
