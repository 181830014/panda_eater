If one opens a workspace or any other resource in a new window, closes the 
first window and then the new one, when eclipse opens again, the focus will be 
on the project (window name too).
If one navigates 'Up to Workspace', closes eclipse and reopens it, the 
workbench will be still with focus on that project.
