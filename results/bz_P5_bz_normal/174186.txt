Word Emitter does not recognize margin and padding settings, but PDF and HTML do. Using a single <p/> in a Text object does create a blank line between text with Word Emitter and HTML, but not in PDF.   However, a <p/> between text in in a Text object does create the blank line in all three.  <br/> causes a carriage return in PDF and HTML, but is not recognized in Word.  In PDF, <br/> creates a space before the second line of text begins.

10 point Serif font renders as 9 point in PDF, but as 10 point in Word and HTML.  "Medium" serif renders as 9 point Times Roman in Word and PDF, but as 12 point Times Roman in HTML.

This was tested without a CSS file.  I'm using Internet Explorer 6 for HTML, Microsoft Word 2003 and Adobe Reader 8.  Using 2.2M4, IText 1.4.8.
