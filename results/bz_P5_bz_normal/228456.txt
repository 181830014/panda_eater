PersistenceUnitProperties is mainly a list of static Strings used for the persistence.xml property names.  A few of the Strings in here are the corresponding values, not names.

An example that seems to be the standard:
Caching includes only the property names in PersistenceUnitProperties while the values are in a separate interface CacheType.

Inconsistent cases:
   String DDL_GENERATION   = "eclipselink.ddl-generation";
This is the property name while the following are the possible values for this property.  They should be in a separate interface maybe called DDLGeneration
    
    String CREATE_ONLY      = "create-tables";
    String DROP_AND_CREATE  = "drop-and-create-tables";
    String NONE             = "none";


Same problem here:
    String DDL_GENERATION_MODE = "eclipselink.ddl-generation.output-mode";
This is the property name while the following are the possible values:

    String DDL_SQL_SCRIPT_GENERATION = "sql-script";
    String DDL_DATABASE_GENERATION = "database";
    String DDL_BOTH_GENERATION = "both";
