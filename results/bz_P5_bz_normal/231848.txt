Various PU wide defaults that we currently provide properties for in persistence.xml should be settable in the persistence-unit-metadata section of the  EclipseLink mapping file.  The persistence.xml properties were defined and implemented before work began on the EclipseLink mapping file and should be deprecated in a future release with the recommended solution being the use of the mapping file persistence-unit-metadata.

We should examine all the properties in persistence.xml to see what are appropriate to move to persistence-unit-metadata but we can start with the defaults:

eclipselink.cache.size.default
eclipselink.cache.type.default
eclipselink.cache.shared.default
