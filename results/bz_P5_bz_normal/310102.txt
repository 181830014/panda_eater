Hi,

I want to integrate MoDisco Browser into a product but I discovered that several icons appeared due to the dependency "org.eclipse.jdt.ui" present in the plugin "org.eclipse.gmt.modisco.infra.query.ui". Can you separate the creation tools and the execution tools for this plugin allowing to integrate it in a product without having query creation feature?

Best regards,

Nicolas Payneau
