The RCP application I am working on makes heavy use of the Job API. The RCP
workbench includes the interesting little "eye" shaped icon in the lower right
corner with the tooltip "Shows background taks in the Progress View".

The "Progress View" in question is part of the eclipse.ide.ui plugin (and is not
part of my GIS application). The usual monkey see monkey do rules does not help
me here as the the Progress View makes use of internal API (and is itself internal).

I suspect it is too late in the release cycle for the Progress View (and its
friend the Error Log) to be moved over to the eclipse.ui plugin. 

There are two more options for the "Show Progress View" button:
- removal from eclipse.ui (it contributes functionality into my RCP app that I
am unable to make good on), and addition to eclipse.ui.ide
- provide the ability to open up an RCP supplied view
