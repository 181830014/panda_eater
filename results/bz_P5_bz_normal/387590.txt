Steps to reproduce : 
	1/ Create a new Ecore Model with EClass3, EClass2 and EClass1
	2/ Create a new table and fill it with the EClasses
	3/ Select the name column header to sort them
		-> the first clisk sorts is done correctly (Ascending sort)
		-> the second clicks does nothing (Descending sort) (debugging, we see that it does an ascending sort too)
		-> the third click doesn't nothing (none sort) (debugging, we see that it does an ascending sort too)
I think it is because the table model doesn't store the sort of the column header. 
It is a regression because it works fine on the previous version of the table (0.1.X)
