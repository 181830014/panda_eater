When population of children treeitems is done using a background job, 
a "Pending" TreeItem is places as child 0 of the container treeitem.  When the 
job completes, this treeitem is disposed.  So, when the user places the mouse 
over an item and tries to select it, the item often moves up one position 
because of the above disposal.

To avoid the sifting, the "Pending" item could be the last child instead of 
the first, since that is where the pending children show up.  Or, the parent 
treeitem could be decorated in its string to show something like:
"cdt-home (pending)"
