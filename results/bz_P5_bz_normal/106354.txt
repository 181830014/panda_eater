I think there is a fundamental problem using a native widget (progress bar) on 
the splash screen.  The problem is that the rest of the splash screen is not 
natively-themed, while the progress bar is.  On my system, for example, the 
progress bar is a light grey on a light grey background with a faint 
bevelling.  This stands out as a rather out of place bright grey line across 
an otherwise dark blue background. 
 
I can see other problems arising with margins and such like, so that it might 
be possible to clip text in unpredictable ways.
