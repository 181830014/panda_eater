I am running eclipse GTK 3.1M5a on a latest Ubuntu Linux with gnome 2.10

an operation like copy of a java type from package explorer and paste on the
same package normally brings up an input dialog asking for a new name.

thsi is totally hidden by the progress dialog which stays on top of the input
one. please note from the attached screenshot that even if I focus the input
dilaog, that it is still behind the progress dilaog
