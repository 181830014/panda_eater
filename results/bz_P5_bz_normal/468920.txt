The plugin names are not consistent and should be updated.

Some examples:
- there are bundles named "EMFForms ..." and "EMF Forms ..."
- some of the bundles have names that start with "ECP ...", but not all of them
- *ecp.ide.editor.viewmodel is called just "Viewmodel" and then there's *ecp.view.model that's called just "View Model"
- *ecp.view.edapt is called just "Edapt"
etc.
