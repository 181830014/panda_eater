If you have a file checked into source control and press CTRL/1 on an 
annotation to bring up the QuickFix list, edit notification is sent to the VCS 
and the file is considered "modified" even though no modification has occurred 
yet, and may never occur.  For example, the user may dismiss the QuickFix 
list, or may select the QuickFix item to add a word to the spell checker 
dictionary.  VCS edit notification should only be sent when accepting a 
QuickFix would actually result in the file under source control being modified.
