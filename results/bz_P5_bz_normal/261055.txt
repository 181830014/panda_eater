Noticed the following in ListWrapper in the addAll method
// non-default Pluggable implementations do not require updateContainment
dataObject.getCurrentValueStore().setManyProperty(property, this);
     
I don't see the same code in the addAll that takes an index or in the add()
methods.  I dont know what is special about the setManyProperty method on the
Valustore (vs the regular setDeclaredProperty or setOpenContentProperty
methods) but I think either it shouldn't be there or it would seem that all
the add methods should have the same behavior and use it.
