In the event that the UI plugin is unable to set the value of the instance 
location messages such as
   "Error occurred in runtime.  Workspace cannot be set.  Exiting."
are being logged and/or displayed to the user in a dialog.

This is causing the Core team to get numerous bug reports when in fact there is 
nothing wrong with the runtime.  The workspace location was simply already 
set.  Everything is performing as expected.
