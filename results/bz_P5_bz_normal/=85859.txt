I20050217-2000, KDE 3.3.2, Motif, X.Org 6.8.0, Linux 2.6.10

I was trying to test the key assist dialog (Ctrl+Shift+L) on Motif, and noticed
that in some circumstances, the dialog opens and begins to flicker -- as if it
is changing size or location repeatedly.  My code only tries to set the initial
position, and the sizing code is only called once.  Yet the flicker still occurs.

Essentially, it is trying to size and position the dialog so it appears in the
bottom-right of the workbench window.  To do this, it queries the workbench size
 and scales the dialog to be proportional.  It then checks the workbench window
and display bounds, and tries to place it in view and on the bottom right edge.

This is some debugging output from when the flicker occurs.  The size is being
set to {353,392} and the position to {897,425}.

Please stop by if you need help reproducing this....


KeyAssistDialog.configureSize()
getSize() = Point {353, 1563}
workbench window size = Point {1026, 784}
maxWidth = 410
maxHeight = 392
setting size to Point {353, 392}
KeyAssistDialog.configureLocation(Point)
workbench window bounds = Rectangle {234, 43, 1026, 784}
setting location to = Point {897, 425}
