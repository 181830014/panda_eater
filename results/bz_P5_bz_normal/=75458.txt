We use the PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getProgressService().run() API to perform 
work in a progress dialog. Inside out runnable, we prompt for user input. On 
the Mac, this will result in a freeze since the proper dialog parenting is not 
done. Since there is no way to get the proper parenting with this API, it 
should have a comment in the javdoc stating that prompting using a dialog 
should not be done from within the runnable as this will reuslt in improper 
behavior on some platforms and deadlock on others. The improper behavior is on 
windows where the dialog is opened but appears in the wrong place.
