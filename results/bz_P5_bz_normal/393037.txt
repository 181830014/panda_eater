The discoverer org.eclipse.gmt.modisco.java.generation.actions.GenerateJavaModel is currently registered under the wrong extension point "org.eclipse.gmt.modisco.discoverers". But the extension point to be used is "org.eclipse.modisco.infra.discovery.core.discoverer".

I want to generate java source from a discovered and modified java model. But currently I'm unable to do that, because the GenerateJavaModel discoverer is not found.

I'm using Indigo.
