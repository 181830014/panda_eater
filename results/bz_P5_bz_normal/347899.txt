Hi,

There is a button "Open a table" in the EMF Facet "Model Table" view toolbar.

I think such an action should not exist, since editing a saved table should only be available in an editor (such as the EMF Facet table editor).

Edition in the view should only be associated with an opened editor (so that they can share their editingDomain).

Regards,
Nicolas Guyomar
