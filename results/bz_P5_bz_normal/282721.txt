It seems, that BIRT does not automatically updates the references upon renaming the report elements.
This bug was discovered particularly for group elements.
Suppose my table has a group "GroupA". My footer rows have some aggregations based on GroupA.
Now, if I rename my GroupA to be GroupB and open the properties for the aggregates, they will show the blanks for the group. Internally though (xml file), they still point to the GroupA. Of course, if you run the report, it will throw some exceptions.
Guess, this problem exists not only for groups.
