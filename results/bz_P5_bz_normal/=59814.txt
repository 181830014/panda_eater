I am now seeing bold and italic fonts in my views. I have no idea what these 
mean. Where does the idea of using italics to mean "in progress" come from?

What about overlaying an [animated] hourglass decorator icon on the view's 
icon.  Of course, you'd have to be showing icons for views all the time (or at 
least when busy).

Related, every time I change selection in the workbench, the problems view 
temporarily changes to italics.  It is a flicker which lasts for about 1/10th 
of a second, and is pretty annoying.
