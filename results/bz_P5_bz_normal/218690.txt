As per the title, removing an Entity from a uni-directional OneToMany does not removed the Entity from the database.  It only results in the deletion of the relationship from the join table.

E.g.,

    @OneToMany
    @PrivateOwned
    java.util.List<Child> children = new ArrayList<Child>();

children.remove(0) will result in something like:

DELETE FROM Parent_Child WHERE ((parent_id = ?) AND (child_id = ?))
	bind => [302, 301]

But no DELETE from the CHILD table is generated.
