reports

In text item, I input some text which has special characters. When click OK, the text item is created successfully. But when previewing the report, I met exception said "There is no report design object available." First I'm very confused why this happen? And I check the XML, it told me the report is invalid and I can not go back to the layout. I think If the text has invalid character I think we should not allow to create this item and tell user the text includes some illegal characters. Otherwise, when user preview this report he is confused why this report object is not available? And why the report became to be illegal and he can not go back the layout.
