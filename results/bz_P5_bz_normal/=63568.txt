IIntroPart.standbyStateChanged() is called when intro view is closed and when 
the workbench is shutdown. Is this supposed to happen? the standby state 
reallt did *not* change. In one case we closed view, in the other, the 
workbench was shut down. 
IMOH, I think this event should not be fiered at these times. 
Plus, for performance, I try to create standby content only when the workbench 
calls the intro view with standby = true (ie: someone asked to see the standby 
part). But with the workbench calling this method at these times, I can not 
accomplish this.
