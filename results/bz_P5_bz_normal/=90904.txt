In 3.1M6, IWorkbench.getCommandSupport() is deprecated; comments say to use
IWorkbench.getAdapter(ICommandSupport.class). If that's the preferred pattern,
then it seems to me that IWorkbench.getBrowserSupport() should be replaced with
IWorkbench.getAdapter(IBrowserSupport.class). Other methods in this interface
should be reviewed too, especially the ones added in 3.1 such as
getOperationSupport(). 

Although the API is supposed to be frozen for 3.1 it would be better to fix
these problems before 3.1 goes production than create more deprecations
afterwards. This would probably require PMC approval.
