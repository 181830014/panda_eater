Steps to reproduce:
  1. Open a new Android project in Eclipse or download a existing project (for example: GitHub).
  2. Add XXE payload to the AndroidManifest.xml file.
  3. Open the project with Eclipse and the payload will be executed. 


An attacker can build a malicious project library containing XXE payload and distribute it.
Anyone who downloads the malicious project and open it using Eclipse will be affected.
An Attacker can extract any file he wishes to from the victim's file system.
