The STS is always enabling "MustUnderstand" in the SOAP header responses.   This ought to be configurable somehow;  a runtime system property; an API, etc.
The offending code is in org.eclipse.higgins.sts.binding.axis1x.security.WSSResponseGeneratorHandler
which has the following code: headerSecurity.setMustUnderstand(true);
