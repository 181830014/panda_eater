When the model is edited in another editor (e.g. EMF Sample Ecore Model Editor) while it is also opened in the Ecore Editor, the Ecore Editor produces a display error after switching back to it:
The package of the model displays a red triangle overlay over its package symbol as if there was an error in the package. In reality, there is no error. This is fixed when the editor is closed and the file reopened.
