Hudson tests for checking compatibility of XDCtools with different versions of codec engine are not working. Please review http://hollyoak.sanb.design.ti.com:8080/job/XDCtools_vs_CE/52/ for details. Explanation of test results are available at http://wiki.sanb.design.ti.com/twiki/pub/CT/PdpXdcRelease3x15x03/hudson_test_results.txt

For XDCtools 3.16 release these tests need to be fixed.
