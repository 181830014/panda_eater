Debug (and probably the readonly editor) needs this so we must try to address it in 0.8.1 I3.

Simple test case:
String handleId = classFile.getHandleIdentifier();
IClassFile newFile = EGLCore.create(handleId);

This does not create an equivalent IClassFile, it's instead creating an IPackageFragment.

There's a problem creating the memento, and also a problem restoring from a memento. I'll attach a patch that fixes creating the memento, but restoring from a memento still needs to be addressed.
