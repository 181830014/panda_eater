The EMFFormsLabelProvider can be used to determine a 'displayed' name for a domain model reference by calling "#getDisplayName(VDomainModelReference):IObservableValue". The default implementation internally uses the EMFForms databinding to determine the relevant EStructuralFeature and returns a ConstantObservableValue for the displayed name. 

To avoid the databinding overhead and its restrictions on the caller thread, it would be nice if there was an EMF version of the EMFFormsLabelProvider interface which would expose the already implemented internal behavior. For example by offering "#getDisplayName(EStructuralFeature):String".
