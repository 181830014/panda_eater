Currently Error that occur during preview are logged into the error log and pop up as dialogs. Thus we get automatic reports with the new eclipse releases. Those error are no real ide error, those are only misconfigurations of the view model.
We should think about introducing an emfforms log and thus not log into the eclipse log anymore.
