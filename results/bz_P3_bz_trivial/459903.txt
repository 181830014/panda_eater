Hi,

It should be nice if it would be possible to have an easy way to override root resource of a org.eclipse.californium.core.CoapServer.

It is possible to do it, by extending org.eclipse.californium.core.CoapServer , but a setter for rootResource (that set the childs from the old one) would allow easier customisation.

A workaround is to reuse the same code as constructor:
	this.deliverer = new ServerMessageDeliverer(root);
	CoapResource well_known = new CoapResource(".well-known");
	well_known.setVisible(false);
	well_known.add(new DiscoveryResource(root));
	root.add(well_known);

But this is not ideal as it doesn't override the org.eclipse.californium.core.CoapServer.root and thus the org.eclipse.californium.core.CoapServer.{add(),Remove(),GetRoot()} points to the old instance
