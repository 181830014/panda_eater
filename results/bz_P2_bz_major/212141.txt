Currently there is an Application with properties showing JAR-archive, java class, method, etc. But this is normally java-application specific. For a web service one does not need a JAR-archive, but a web service interface and method instead. Therefore, the part of the metamodel should be changed:
Application with additional subclass JavaApplication. jarArchive, javaClass and method should be moved to JavaApplication, the rest (type, input and output) stays with the Application.
Afterwards the Converter needs to be adapted (ChangeCommands for this new version 1.3.1) to change all existing applications to JavaApplications. Besides, the Documentation, Simulation and Codegeneration needs to be adapted, too as well as the views which should be covering the JavaApplications then in the technical view but not in the business view.
