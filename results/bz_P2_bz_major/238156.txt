If I export a connection and import it in a clean workspace all the default filters associated with that connection are not created on the import.  Any custom filters are imported however.

Need to do a new connection of that type before they will show up.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a linux connection
2. Export it.
3. Start a clean workspace
4. Import the exported linux connection
5. Try to expand Files subsystem.  Default filters are not there.
