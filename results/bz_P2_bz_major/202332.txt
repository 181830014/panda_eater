I have been asked lately by a few folks to point them to a COSMOS demo and I noticed that they were not eager to install the tool in order to see the demo.
All they wanted was a quick overview of the function.
Would it be possible to build a viewlet that runs the demo and attach it to the demo script section for people who just want to browse the project?
