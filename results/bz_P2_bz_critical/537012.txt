Stephan Herrmann reported an expired link page (Bug 536950 - Expired promotion link) on one of our advertisement because the promo was expired.

By design, our Eclipse Foundation campaign manager will expire a promo after 3 years. 

To avoid this issue in the future, we must create a notification feature that will email the Eclipse Foundation webdev team before a link is expired. 

This should allow us to renew a campaign before it's expired.
