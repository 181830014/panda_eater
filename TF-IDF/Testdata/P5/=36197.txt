Build 2.1

1. Turn autobuild off
2. Export preferences
3. Start a new workspace
4. Import the preferences you exported in 2
Observe: The autobuild preference is still on until you restart.

Same happend with the 'Show color icons' preference.

It should offer to retart the workbench after importing the preferences.
