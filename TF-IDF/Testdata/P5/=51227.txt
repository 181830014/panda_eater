Having added *.log to my list of file types in the "File Associations" section 
of the Workbench preferences, then associating that file type with the Internal 
Text editor; I had expected the icon of that file type to change within the 
Package explorer.
The icon should have changed to the icon used for all file types associated 
with the Internal text editor, but instead; it remained as the icon of the 
External text editor that was associated with that file type by the operating 
system.
The icon was only correctly reflected in the Package explorer after I had 
closed and re-opened my project.
