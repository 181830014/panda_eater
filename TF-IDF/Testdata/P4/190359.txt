Cleanup inconsistency in showing task keys in all Mylar UI. For example:

-- task ids/keys are shown in Task List
-- and in editor's titles and editor history
-- and in Open Task dialogs

-- but NOT in popups for selected rows in Task List
-- and NOT in task history drop down
-- and NOT in active changesets in Sync view

Is suggest so show task keys everywhere. Please add to this if I missed some places.
