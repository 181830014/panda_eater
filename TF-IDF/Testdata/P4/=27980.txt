The plugin.xml registration allows the user to register a new editor for a file 
type. However, there is no public API to register file associations?
There is a public interface, IFileEditorMapping, for accessing this information 
but none for creating a new one. Could you add an API for dynamically 
registering an editor (not just XML)?
