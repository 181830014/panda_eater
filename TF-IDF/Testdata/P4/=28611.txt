Hi,
I had posted a query in the newsgroup asking how to add colors as entries in a 
combo. Apparently, it seems its not possible to achieve this. Any particular 
reason as to y this is not allowed presently. It seems we can have colored 
table items in a Table.
Im presently developing a plugin using WSAD v 4.0.3 (i guess it uses Eclipse v 
1.0)
thanx
Ajay
