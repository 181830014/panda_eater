From within the Sync view, did a Mark as Merged.
The string shown in the progress indicator at bottom left was truncated in the
middle.
Hovering over the progress indicator does not show any tooltip.
Had to double-click and look at it in the progress view.

The progress indicator should have a tooltip that shows the full, untruncated,
text of the current message.  

It should also update if the message changes while the tooltip is showing.
