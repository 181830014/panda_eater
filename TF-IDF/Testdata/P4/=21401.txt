Normal X applications allow the user to specify the display that should be used
through the -dispay command line option. Eclipse doesnot comply with this
behaviour, the only way to set the display is through the environment variable
DISPLAY, however this cannot be adapted from the PDE launch configuration.

I would like to be able to start an eclipse instance in an Xnest server, so that
the grabs (as sometimes done by the gtk swt implementation) are only effictive
in that server.
