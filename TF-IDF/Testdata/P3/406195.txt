Hello, as discussed in http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/477119/, I was thinking that being able to access the attributes of references might be a nice addition, making labeling just so much more comfortable.

Below I added an example of how I should think this feature should look in use, should it be implemented.
The "type.name" part in the label description of a feature should point to the "name" attribute of the type referenced in the feature.

Would be nice if that could be looked into and maybe added in a future release!

---
@gmf.node(label = "name")
class Type extends AbstractElement {
  attr String name;
}
...
@gmf.node(label="name, type.name", label.pattern="{0} (Type: {1})")
class Feature {
  attr String name;
  ref Type type;
}
