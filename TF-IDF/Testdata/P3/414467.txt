I believe that having a chapter that describes the basics of Epsilon java integration would be helpfull. It would be nice to include the following information:

1 - Quick way to run it from Java
Maybe the standalone example should be integrated in the Epsilon API so that developpers can use it directly. Or the existing API to create models and modules should be detailed.
Also, it would be usefull to declare the epsilon plugins that must be imported.

2 - Advanced Java integration
Briefly describe the architecture of the system: model, module, engine and how they cooperate, who creates what and most important, how to DISPOSE PROPERLY.
Describe, in details, how developpers can interact with registries (for packages and modules) and how they can tweak the behaviour of the execution process (customize serialization options, customize caching...).

Thanks
