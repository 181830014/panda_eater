Although we can getAccessible() on the CCombo widget itself, focus always 
belongs to the Text or List member variables.  Thus, if there is no obvious 
accessible name, a screen reader check fails & there is no programmatic way to 
fix it.

Perhaps provide getTextAccessible() and getListAccessible() methods?
