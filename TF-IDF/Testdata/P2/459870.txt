The ITE should not connect to an AUT in this case and should throw an appropriate error message. I've noticed this when I was testing an RCP application with a newer version of the RCP-Accessor. The AUT can be started but when the Object-mapping is activated the AUT just terminates and the ITE only shows an "Unexpected Error" dialog.
