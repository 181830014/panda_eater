when adding the first event, data type or adapter to a FBs interface via drag and drop from the palette, there is only a very small area where it can be dropped successfully. 
Also the feedback doesn't work, because when outside of this area there is still a plus shown.  


as soon as there is already an event, data type or adapter, adding the next one works better, because a black line is shown where the new element can be added. (but the same black line with the plus is also shown when for example trying to add a data type to the events)
