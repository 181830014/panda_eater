There is the window "Watches" with table "Watched elements" in Debug perspective.
1) I suggest adding the ability to delete items from the table.
2) I suggest adding the ability to output items in different formats (HEX, BIN) in new columns Value.
3) I suggest adding the ability to link items from the table with Editor.
