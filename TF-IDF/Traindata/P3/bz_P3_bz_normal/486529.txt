After creating a Client with ClientOptions, there's no way to retrieve the ClientOptions from the Client.  I want to implement a single ConnectionLostHandler to be used by all my connections (I have more than one), but when the handler is invoked, there's no way to tell from the *Client passed in which connection was lost.

Obviously, after a Client has been created, no further changes should be allowed to the ClientOptions, so the Client.options field should not be exported.  However, a method could be added that returns a *copy* of the ClientOptions struct used to create the Client:


// Options returns a copy of the ClientOptions used to create this client.
func (c *Client) Options() ClientOptions {
	optionsCopy := c.options
	return optionsCopy
}
