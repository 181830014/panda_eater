When looking into specifics FBs(and data inputs/outputs inside them), I was scrolling with my wheel on the mouse to see more details, but since I scrolled over “type” field of specific data input, I changed type of this data input accidentally. 
Walk through: go to interface of some FB-> click to some of the input data-> under properties, roll the mouse wheel over the "type" field and it will change.

I think that this option should be disallowed, since it can cause a lot of accidental troubles.
