This is an enhancement related to the bug nÂ°484129 (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=484129). The idea is that the batch doc generation tool should be called with the following parameters on the command line : 
 - the template's path
 - the the model's path
 - the generated document's path
 - the value of all the generation parameters

A property file could conveniently be specified in cases many parameters are to be specified. 

This would allow using a template with several models without changing it at all which is a rather common use case.
