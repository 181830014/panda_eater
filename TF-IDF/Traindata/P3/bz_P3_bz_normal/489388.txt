!!! Ohhhhh boy.
!!! You are on Windows and installed Che into a directory that contains a space.
!!! Tomcat behaves badly because of this.
!!!
!!! We attempted to work around this by converting your path to one without a space.
!!! However, it seems that the drive where Che is installed does not allow this.
!!! So we seem to be buggered.
!!!
!!! You can fix this issue by installing Che into a directory without spaces in the name.
!!! Isn't Windows fun?  Long live William Shatner.

The eclipse-che-latest.exe I downloaded created the installation directory, so either it is defective, or the work-around is defective. Either way, the beginner user experience is less than satisfactory.

Recommend installation directory be 

C:\Users\Eric\AppData\Local\Programs\Eclipse-Che\eclipse-che-4.0.0-RC13
