Hello there, thanks for the awesome tool that 4Diac is, we use it a lot!

### Question:
Can I have a password prompt upon trying to deploy a project from the IDE to my remote forte application?
If it already exist can you guide me in how to find and enable it?

### Why we need it:
We have some industrial clients that, due to the current virus problem, neglected our access to their plants but still want the automation products we deliver.
We work fully with 4Diac and encapsulate our developments in custom blocks.

Now the industries can provide us with remote access to a PC in their facilities but as long as we know once seen the IP and port, one can deploy any project in our hardware and compromise the work. So by seeing us working remotely they may think they can change a thing or two there and end up deploying an empty project there by mistake.

We think this remote access is good for us (cost reduction) and for 4Diac as well as it increases the visibility of the package.
But we need some security layer to avoid unnecessary support.
