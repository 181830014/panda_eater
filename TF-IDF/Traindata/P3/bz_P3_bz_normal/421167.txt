(sorry, this is a duplicate of something I already pasted to the forums by mistake)

The "Basic Tutorial" that comes with the VJET Development User Guide has some inconsistencies that should be addressed.

1. At the end of the "Creating your first VJET project", the "Next Section" link points to "VJET JS Type Libraries", but the actual next section in the tutorial appears to be "Creating a VJET Type"

2 Under "Using Content assist", the "setClose" function belongs under "protos" not under "props" is is suggested.

3. Under "Using Content assist", the "Next Section" link is identified as "Identifying problems in your code", but it looks like it should be "Using comment completion"

4. In the "Using code templates" section, step 5 says "complete the for loop as follows" -- there is no for loop in the example code.

5. In "Searching the workbench" - the main function belongs in the "props" area, not the protos area.

6. In "Running VJET JS application" (aka, Running your programs), step 3 says to "Select Test.js"... but you should really select "MyTest.js", as is shown in the picture below the text.

I guess that's it. Hope this helps.
