Hello,
Now I can do "Show FB in application" when I select FB in System Configuration->[Device]->[Resource] file.
But I cannot do it when I select FB in System Explorer->[System]->[App].
Also I cannot use Edit->Find to find any FB in application.
I think it will be very conveniently if these functions to work.
Thanks
