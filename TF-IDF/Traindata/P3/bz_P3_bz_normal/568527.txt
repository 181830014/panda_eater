Minimal Example

The equals method of VABModelMap is returning true if one MapEntry is equal but the others don't.

This for example affects the AASBundle. As two SubModels with the same parent (AAS) are considered equal, which isn't necessarily the case because AASBundle expects a Set.

The equals method of VABModelMap contains fast return cases with "true" if the first element is equal, but we have to compare the complete map until we find a "false" case or all are equal.
