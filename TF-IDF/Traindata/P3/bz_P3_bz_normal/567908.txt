mapping example

In one of our projects we use Basyx SDK. This bug is created here as we think it is an upstream issue:


The JSON structure exposed on the BaSyx REST API does not conform to chapter 5.5 and Annex F of the AAS specification which describe the JSON mapping.

I assume that we can't easily change the JSON mapping in this project as it is probably buried deep in the BaSyx SDK. However, it should be documented that this behavior precludes us from fulfilling our requirement of being compatible to the specification.
