I have a Node.js project in my Eclipse workspace and when I try to add/remove projects to Cloud Foundry defined server my project doesn't appear.

It is not possible also using Run As -> Run on Server

What it is true, is that I don't have any facet for Node.js, but I haven't found any about Cloud Foundry neither.

Is it a bug? Or should it be a feature request?

Thanks.
