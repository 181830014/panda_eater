While executing an Acceleo template, an exception occurred. It was caused by a stack overflow due to infinite recursion in a query I wrote.

However, I didn't notice the exception at first. The exception is logged in the error log of Eclipse. The only way to see that something went wrong, is to have the 'Error Log' view added to the perspective, and visible at the time of execution. Only then do you see additional items being added. However, I didn't have the 'Error Log' view visible.

No other feedback was given. No error message popup, nothing. I first noticed that my output file was empty, after which I started to investigate. However, if my file would have been partially generated, I might have missed that it was only partially generated.

My conclusion is that it would be good if Acceleo gave more visual feedback that something went wrong (it crashed!). I think a popup indicating that the template execution failed (or something that is more end user friendly, e.g. include the action name that started the template execution or so) would be good. The message could refer to the 'Error Log' for details. In fact, if StatusManager.handle(...) would be used, with a 'StatusManager.LOG | StatusManager.SHOW' value for the 'style' argument, this would be provided automatically I think.
