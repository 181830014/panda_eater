When opening an application where the typelibrary is missing a custom FB it deletes the type information from the sys file. In order to restore the project correctly I need to add the missing type and then copying the old sys file from a backup or add the type information manually. It's not possible to change the type in the application so this is the only way since a system import does not include the custom types in the project library in my case (I don't know whether that is the correct behaviour). Please notify me that a type is missing and optionally let me set it to the correct one before simply deleting the information.
