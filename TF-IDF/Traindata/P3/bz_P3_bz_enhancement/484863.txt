I'm using a very simple wizard in terms of its functionality just like the presented example of message [#1718249] in Epsilon forum. But, it takes too time to load the wizard in the pop-up Wizards menu! How can I speed up the wizard loading time? (I run the wizard in the UML Designer 5.0 under the recent release of the Eclipse Mars)
