The Kotlin plugin for eclipse[1] is a bit weird. It generates the output .class files in a virtual folder called `kotlin_bin`. Everything works fine except that the emitted APK doesn't have the .class files emitted by the Kotlin plugin.

I think ADT (original as well as this one) fail to pick up the .class files from the virtual folder. Is it something that you could address in this fork of ADT?

thanks!
