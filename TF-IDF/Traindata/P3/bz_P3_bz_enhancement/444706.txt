Currently it is possible to export a transformation trace from an etl/ etlmodule. However it is not possible to import transformation traces. (neither in java-code nor via ant, as there is no setTransformationTrace() method.

Provide a mechanism for etl and eml modules to import one or more transformation traces (in ant and in java).
