As being discussed in [1]:

- EPL script can currently be run through an ANT task and a "Run configuration"
- The results of an EPL script are Matches contained in a PatternMatchModel
- The results can only be exported with the ANT task

It would be nice to include some form of the same kind as the ANT task provides in the 'Run configuration'.

I think this would mean that another kind of model would need to be added to the 'Run configuration' dialog, but this may not be trivial to add.

How to specify for example, the following case:

main.eol -> uses Model1, Model2 and Patterns (from patterns.epl)
patterns.epl -> uses Model1

Are the Model1 instances the same? If not, this will lead to unexpected (i.e. not very useful) behavior.
