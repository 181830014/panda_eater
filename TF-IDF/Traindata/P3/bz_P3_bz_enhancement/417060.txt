Currently, EVL validates the complete model.
This is usable for live validation, but for large models, it is going to take too long to validate the model.

This is because the complete model is checked, even if the validation request asks to check a single element.

This behaviour needs to be changed to properly support and speed up live validation.

See http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/521880/ for a little more detail and my hack-ish solution.
