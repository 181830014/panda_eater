There's a NPE when generation ant/buckminster scripts that include an SVNLocation with localPath == null. The error disappears after setting the value to the empty string.

Independently of that, I also note that there's something fishy with the username/password section of the  svn provider uri that's generated in the buckminster .rmap:

<uri format="svn+ssh://:null@svn.acme.com//svnroot/my/project">
