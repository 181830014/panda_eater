- As you drill down you have no indication of the context that you are in.
- Forward and back don't make sense, its really up or down since its a tree
- We could borrow from the MS file explorer's where you get a dropdown viewer at the top
that show your parent tree.  This allows you to pick a spot in your parent tree to go back up to.
