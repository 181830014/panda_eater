The following requirement was gathered at EclipseCon Europe during the presentation of Papyrus-RT.

Tow attendees indicated that they were operating in limited environments that required tight control over memory usage.

Their request was to be able to set the the maximum size of the message queues (and probably the message pool) and to be able to prevent the message queue from growing (i.e., have an upper limit on the total number of messages in the system). This meant that if there are no free messages when trying to send a message results in aspecific error returned (indicating that no more messages are available and the the user/state machine should retry later.

They were fine with such a situation (error returned).
