It would be nice if there was a last_comment_number commit template variable that would insert the number of the most recent comment. I use Bugzilla, but this should probably work with other trackers too.

My use-case is the following:

1) Activate task.
2) Do work.
3) Post comment to task.
4) Commit change set.

I would like the link in the commit message to refer to the comment I made just before the commit. At the moment, this implies adding a #c${last_comment_number} manually, but it would be nicer if this could be done automatically.
