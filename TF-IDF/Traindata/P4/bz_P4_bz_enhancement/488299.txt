The bug 481849 is the first step to have only RepresentationDescription meta-models in the scope of validation. That bug handle part of the validation aspects ensuring that meta-models are correctly declared and also that Domain class is part of the declared Meta-modes

This ticket is about ensuring that the interpreted expression uses Class that are declared in the MM.

Currently the interpreted expression validation uses declared MM but also MM used as VSP dependency.
Explanations:
The 
org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.JavaExtensionsManager.reloadEPackages() method add EPackage found in the VSP dependencies.
JavaExtensionsManager is instanciated by AcceleoAbstractInterpreter(AQL) and ServiceInterpreter that are IInterpreter.
These IInterpreter are created(indirectly) by the singleton CompoundInterpreter.INSTANCE.

The problem is that the CompoundInterpreter instance is used for completion and for the runtime as well.
Finally, the question handle this ticket is perhaps how to manage the JavaExtensionsManager behavior for validation only for validation but not for run-time.
Perhaps the solution is to change IInterpreter or IInterpretercontext API to manage a MM scope at this level and don't a fixed and non manageable implementation of JavaExtensionsManager do the job.
