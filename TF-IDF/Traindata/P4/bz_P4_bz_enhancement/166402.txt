Improve how stack traces are shown in the task editor. Currently it is hard to read them because they are wrapped several times. 

I wonder if we can have an option to hide qualified type names (option available in many Eclipse views), then show full name in the tooltip on mouse hover or F2 like in other Eclipse editors.
