When investigating regression (e.g. like on in bug 194519), it would be quite useful to synchronize Task Editor's Outline view with CVS History view. So, selecting entry in CVS history would select comment in the Task List editor and in the Outline view based on the closest timestamp and ILinkedTaskInfo, though we'll need to add timestamp to that interface (damn!).

And vice versa, selecting comments or attachments could select entry in the CVS history.

An alternative option could be to add "Show in..." menu that would do the same.
