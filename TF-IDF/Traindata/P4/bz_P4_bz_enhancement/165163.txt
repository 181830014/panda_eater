It would often be very nice and speed up things considerably to be able to open a command shell  directly from the Navigator view with a particular folder as working directory.

Please add a context menu entry to all folders in Navigator view which allows to open a CMD-window (on Windows, or the user's preferred unix shell) with the selected folder as working directory (or directly cd'ing to the selected directory as first ooperation). 

This would often make calling some command-line utility from within eclipse much quicker and easier. Right now, one always has to start the shell, locate the workspace (or whereever a project has been stored) and then spot and cd to that directory manually...
