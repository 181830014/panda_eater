Unable to deselect syntax coloring defaults

In the preferences window, Lua->Editor->Syntax Coloring I am unable to disable the default color and font settings making any theme other than default unusable.

The options to modify the styles are there but the checkbox labeled 'Enable' is on and not modifiable - see attachment.
