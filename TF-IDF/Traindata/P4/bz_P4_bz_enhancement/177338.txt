I would really like to have Mylar close the current active Task as fixed as soon as I comitt the changes for this bug. I would also like to define a comment template, ideally "Fixed > Date", where date is replaced with the current date.

As an alternative, a contextual menu entry "Mark as Fixed" would be handy for the Task View too.
