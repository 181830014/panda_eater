Currently the search engine built into the online help uses stemming to find 
words have have a similar root to the search criteria.

While this is sometimes useful in yeilding more possibly interesting hits, it 
also has the opposite effect of generating more uninteresting hits.

Sometimes the number of hits can be as high as 300, which, without being able 
to refine the hits by searching again witin the results, is sometimes just not 
helpful.

I would like to see the stemming (fuzzy search?) behavior as an option, 
possibly within the Advanced search dialog.
