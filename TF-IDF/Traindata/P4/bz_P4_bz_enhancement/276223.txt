With detached views and several monitors, there are two things we should try to support:

- when switching from two to one monitor, we need to make sure that views move to the new screen
- when restoring the saved size and position (Bug #276222), we need to make sure the view is actually visible (i.e. on one of the screens). If you work with two monitors, you will be aware that some non-Eclipse apps don't get this right and open on the second monitor even when you have one (which is really annoying). We should make sure to avoid this.
