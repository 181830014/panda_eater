Currently expanding the rules sets via the review Navigator, 
The rules leafs display the rule id only, 
this is not sufficient information for the creator of the rules to tell if a rule has already been created or not.
the creator would need to click in many to see what the rule is about.

This shall be easily corrected by displaying the rule id and the title for each rule tree node.
