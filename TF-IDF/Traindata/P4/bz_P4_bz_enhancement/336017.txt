I think one of the more confusing aspects of AMP is the way that queries and selects are handled. I think we need a way to bunch them up so that you could put in one single box the equivalent of "Select all Individuals that are Neighboring, Available and Satisfy the following conditions. It isn't as elegant / generalizable from a pure design standpoint but I think it would be a lot to clearer to users. Comments please!

I've got this down as UI, but it implicates the model probably as well.
