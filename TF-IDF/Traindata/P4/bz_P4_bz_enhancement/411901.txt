It would be great to have a command line option to specify custom html headers to include in generated html.
It is already done for CSS file with option -s, I would expect to have equivalent for custom headers.

In my case, I need it to integrate Google Analytics script in API doc page headers.

For now, I've made a script to insert this custom header content in template file located in template/page.lua

Other documentation tools offer this feature (doxygen with HTML_HEADER option, pandoc -H option, etc): so I think this should be a good addition to luadocumentor.
