_Task List_ and other issue filters - addds ability to filter issues by entering text into _Find_ unput text field. 

*Use case* : I have a list if Issue ids i have to pay attention to (from emails, skype, whatever over sink). It would be killer feature for me to filter those in the _Task view_ at once by pasting into _Find_ input text field the id list.  Currently it filters by looking all the words entered in teh Issue summary.
Lets assume i have issue list:
* XXX-1 Some short Summary 
* XXX-2 Some another more brief summary
* XXX-3 Some another one and even more brief summary

Currently IO have an ability to enter 'some', this will filter all the 3 issue (making other to dissapear). 

*Expected enhancement*
I expect that I could enter 'XXX-1, XXX-2' and other delimiters (',_;')  and this will filter (making other issue to dissapear).
_Expected filtered output:_
* XXX-1 Some short Summary 
* XXX-2 Some another more brief summary
