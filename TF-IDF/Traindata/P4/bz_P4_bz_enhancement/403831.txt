The text on "build schedule" is out of date. 



N builds replace tags specified in org.eclipse.releng map files with HEAD.
I builds use tags in the org.eclipse.releng map files.
M builds use tags in the R3_<n-1>_maintenance (e.g. R3_6_maintenance) branch of org.eclipse.releng.
Performance baseline builds use tags in the perf_3<n-1>x (e.g. perf_36x) branch of org.eclipse.releng.
Teams must update map files in time for I and M build start times.
Performance testing will only occur where indicated.
