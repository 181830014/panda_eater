I am using the texlipse plugin for writing latex documents. When using bibliographic data a *.bbl file is generated every time the tex file is converted to a dvi for viewing. These bbl files can have warnings in them which appear in the problems view. 

when applying mylar to the problems view these warning do not show up, as the bbl file has no interest. 

The problem I could see here is that it is a generated resource that one would not usually want to edit by hand even though it is perfectly acceptable. But warnings in this file indicate that some things should be fixed so they should show up in the problems view even when mylar is applied.
