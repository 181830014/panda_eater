One challenge with resolving bugs is figuring out what user actions triggered them.  The Mylar Monitor component (used for previous user studies and not currently distributed) can provide this information since it logs almost all user interactions with Eclipse.  This enables adding an additional page to the New Repository Task wizard which will allow the user to submit the last n events from their interaction, and obfuscate them for the privacy of the elements they worked on if desired.  This notion of context is orthogonal to task contexts and would not depend on a task having been active.
