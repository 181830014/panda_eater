While it's possible to focus on active task in the outline view, there's no integration with quick outline. (ctrl-o)

I don't think it would be a good idea to filter out all non-context items, but it would be very useful if the matches was ordered by context relevance.

I use quick outline ALL the time and this feature would in many cases make it twice as quick to get where I want.

(If "quick context view" wasn't unbearable slow it might be able to fill this need)

Just to be clear: I'm talking about quick outline in java/javascript/etc. files. (Seems like there's a quick outline for tasks too)
