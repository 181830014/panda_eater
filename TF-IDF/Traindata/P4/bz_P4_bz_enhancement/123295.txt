At the moment, the DeferredContentProvider does not use a stable sort algorithm for sorting elements.
As an effect, each invocation of "DeferredContentProvider.setSortOrder(Comparator)" completely resorts the entire element list without preserving previous sort orders (for elements that are concerned to be equal according to the newly set sort order comparator).

So e.g. it is not possible to first sort a contact list by name and then sort it by zip code preserving the (previous) sort order for all contacts with equal zip codes.
