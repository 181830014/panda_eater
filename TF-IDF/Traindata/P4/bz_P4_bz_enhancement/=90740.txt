I suggest some sort of colouring system for the tabs in Eclipse which would
indicate what project each file belonged to. Sometimes, I have an old version of
the same file opened in multiple tabs, and it causes a lot of confusion about
which is the newer file and which is the older one. It would just also help in
general to code faster when working on multiple projects.

There might be also be a better solution, like somehow grouping the tabs together.
