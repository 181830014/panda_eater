Please allow for multiple tasks to be active at one time (configurable in preferences?).

Mik said in an email response that the original design for Mylyn allowed for multiple active tasks.  You can see this in much of the underlying data structure, such as TaskList.  However, much of the functional logic now assumes that one and only one task can be active.  One particular example is TaskListManager.activateTask(AbstractTask,boolean), which starts deactivating any active tasks before the specified task is activated.  There is a lot of additional UI and context logic that makes "getActiveTask()" type of calls, as well.  We'd like Mylyn's logic to be more conditional; something more like "getActiveTasks()", which would return lists of 0..*.

Here's why:  the users on my project are not developers.  They're like legal researchers who spend their time perusing content in support of multiple, possibly interrelated tasks.  Think of each task as an individual case.  They are queried from a repository that is actual a Weblogic-based BPM.  Our researchers are "multi-taskers."  Any particular document may apply contextually to several simultaneously active cases.  We want to tie in each researched piece of content, whether it's a PDF document, Word file, or whatever, into each task's context.  Then, we want to share that context between users.

We were able to circumvent the functional limitations to fit the needs of our prototype.  In the process, Mylyn got many accolades.  Our customer loved that 80% of the functionality was provided by COTS plugins.  However, we're afraid that our hacks won't last.  The underlying data structures might go away if you go on assuming that users only work on one task at a time.
