Most of the time I am using context-copy-to I want to start working on the target Task, so having mylyn automatically changing the active task to the target task is great.
But although bein a feature people might desire, it is not really expected, at least the first times I was like "hey, what happened? oh, it switched, hm, ah, ok, I want that anyway".

I think by providing a checkbox that lets the user choose between switching active task or not (and being enabled per default) the user would actually not be surprised by the switch at all. And the rare usecase of wanting to stay in the current task. the user can select that.
