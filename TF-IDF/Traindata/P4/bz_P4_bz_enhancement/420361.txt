I'm using milestone 1 of 1.1 (same behavior with 1.0)
If I open a lua file whose extension is not .lua, then neither code completion nor code outline work.
It does work fine with files whose extension is .lua

In both cases, I open the file using the lua editor and in both cases, the file contains just lua code
