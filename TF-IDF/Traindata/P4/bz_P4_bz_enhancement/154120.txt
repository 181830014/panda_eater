We should review how users interact with the workbench, such as how editors, views, and other screen real-estate are managed (e.g. fix the broken minimize), and find ways to make this a better experience for them. This includes improving the new trim support by allowing the end user to hide/show, close and otherwise    configure trim items, improving navigation from hovers (e.g. quick diff), making fast views more flexible (fast views on all sides, fast view orientation affinity, fast view bars show text option).
