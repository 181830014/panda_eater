When you have additional plugins installed that contribue help, the Advanced 
Search dialog box becomes painful to use when you want to limit the book search 
scope.

Adding "Select All" and "Deselect All" buttons would make using this dialog box 
much easier.  See the attached screen shot.

Having just downloaded Eclipse 3.0 M4, I see that the Help dialogs have changed 
since Eclipse 2.0.2 (which I'm using with WSDD).  While things have certainly 
improved, :-), I still think the ability to select/deselect all books needs to 
be addressed, since installing many plugins that contribute help will still 
cause usability problems.

Of course since the Help system uses IE, I'm not sure if these changes are even 
possible, but I hope so.
