I imagine this will become a "none issue" before it's really needed or fixed (such as, could run on Hudson) but thought I'd make a note of it. 

While fixing bug 463616 I thought I'd just use Java 7 everywhere, not just to "do the build" and discovered that CC won't run under Java 7. 

I've lost the stack trace, but ended with something like "There is not a no-argument constructor for BuildLooop". And some hint in the stack this might be related to "reflection", so, might be related to increased security in Java 7? 

Or, a dozen other things. 

Also, in "reconstructing" Cruisecontrol, without the XSS bug (bug 431281) I "messed up" and restored the version that disables everything under cruisecontrol. This is ok for our needs ... but, if we really needed this, should fix that too as part of this enhancement (and/or move to higher level of Jetty :)
