Improve support for Java-like source files. JSP and JSQL are two instances of 
languages that embed passages of Java language code. Eclipse should provide 
better support for Java-like source files. For instance, outline views should 
be able to show the hierarchy of Java elements; it should be possible to index 
these files so that Java search can find the Java declarations and references 
within; it should be possible to use Java code assist on the Java passages; 
refactoring should be able to take these files into account; the debugger 
should be able to step through the Java passages (JSR-045); error highlighting 
should be supported across sections; etc. [JDT Core, JDT UI, JDT Debug]
