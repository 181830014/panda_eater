The current mechanism to specify extension is to use equivalent of following code

ExtensionManager extMgr = serverSession.getDescriptor(entityClass).getExtensionManager();
extMgr.addExtension(fieldName,...); 

As you can see, a descriptor for given entity is required to add extension. Getting to descriptor results in deploy(). It would be nice to have a mechanism that does not trigger deploy. Filling this as a tracking RFE as per discussion with Doug.
