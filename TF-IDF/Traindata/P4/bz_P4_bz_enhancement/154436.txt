Currently it is not possible to use "make less interesting" in classpathc containers, such as JDT's "JRE system library", PDE's "Plug-in Dependencies", or "Maven Dependencies" container used by Maven2 plugin for Eclipse. With the latter one it is quite annoying, since you can't just make all project's libraries uninteresting in one click.
