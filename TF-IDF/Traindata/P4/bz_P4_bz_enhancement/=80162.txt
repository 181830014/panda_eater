For plug-in development, PDE distinguishes between the plug-in projects you 
are working on (source plug-in projects) and plug-in projects you are working 
with but not actually changing (binary plug-in projects). Making this 
distinction afforts the user the benefits of having full source for everything 
in their workspace where it's easily browsed and searched, while permitting 
economies because the latter kind of projects do not actually have to be (re)
compiled. This work item is to support a similar notion of library project for 
Java development in general. The user would be able to flag a Java project as 
a library project; JDT would know how present library projects appropriately 
at the UI, and how to deal with them more efficiently using generated 
binaries. [JDT Core, JDT UI]
