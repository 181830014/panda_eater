rptdesign and output examples

I report a problem in the size of a generated .doc report.
In particular, I notice that a report with few images and 45 pages has 6MByte.


Suppose that I define a rptdesign (as in attach) and apply the Arial style to the entire report. 
The document source format generated is OOXML. The code is reported in the test.doc file attached. 
I notice that in the generated table the CSS style is repeated for every entry of the table. As a consequence I obtain a large size .doc file.  
The problem is more evident when the report has many pages.

Can the doc emitter be optimized in such a way?
Should the style be repeated for every entry or it is possible to declare a common global style? 

kind regards
