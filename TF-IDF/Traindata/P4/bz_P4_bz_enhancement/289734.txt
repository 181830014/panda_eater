Many times I find myself entering many tasks using Mylyn, but choosing component/target version etc from drop downs is slow for me.

Being an RTM user, I find their  "Smart Add feature":http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/smartadd/ a very inspired one. Briefly, it allows a task to be created in a single line, with custom markers defining for task attributes. For example

Fix horrible bug !1 #Core =5h ^tomorrow

Would create a task titled 'Fix horrible bug' with priority 1, component Core with an estimate of 5 hours scheduled for tomorrow.

I think this could be adopted by Mylyn to allow for tasks to be created faster. It's feasible to either create the task straightaway or open the task editor with pre-filled attributes.
