Currently all text in JET templates it compiled to print statements in a single
"generate" method. I would like to be able to change the method that the print
statements are compiled to during the template, allowing for the reuse of
sections of JET code in the template (e.g. using java methods written with JET
as parameterized macros from within the same template). This is VERY useful for
complex JET templates, especially those that need be maintained by hand.

For an example see below that shows how to declare a template method called
"formatThis" that just like a macro can be called from the normal generate method.

<%@ section declare %>
<%private void formatThis(String name) {%>
<i><%=name%></i>
<%}%>

<%@ section generate %>
<% formatThis( "foo" ); %>

Nb. This is similar to a feature called sections in the Jostraca code generator
