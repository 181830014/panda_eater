During task activation the context is saved which includes
* open editors;
* package explorer, project explorer and navigator subtree;
* probably other things.

There is navigation history in eclipse. You can click "back" and "forward" buttons on the toolbar to open editor which was viewed last time. there also is a button to navigate to last edit location.

Mylyn doesn't save these locations yet.

Reproducible: Always

1. Activate task;
2. Open several documents;
3. Press Ctrl-Left, Ctrl-Right to see how navigation works;
4. Activate another task;
5. Open several docs;
6. Press Ctrl-Left, Ctrl-Right to see that navigation from previous task is used;
