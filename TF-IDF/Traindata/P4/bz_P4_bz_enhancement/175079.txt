Hi,

I have several requests for the update site.

1. It would be nice if the download site and the update sites had the same layout as much as possible.  For example, the download site would have junits under SDK.

2. It would be great if more add-ons were on the update site.  For example the Remote CDT Launch Configuration add on.

3. My first instinct was to select the "RSE Runtime only" and "Enabling Features".  At that point I received the error "RSE SSH Services requires plug-in com.jcraft.jsch."  At this point I didn't know where to go to install this plugin.  Can we document the most basic dependencies that everyone will run into in a central place.  Maybe there already is such a place and I just didn't find it.  I guess this is just a general install request.

Thanks,
Ewa.
