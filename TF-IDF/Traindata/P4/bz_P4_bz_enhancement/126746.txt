When you enter a tag and code completion pops up, you want to select the tag and continue editing that tag, for instance, to add attributes. Instead the code completion closes your tag and puts you in the middle of the opening and closing tag to enter child elements.
Sometimes I want the element to be empty like: <mytag />. In that case I have to add the slash and delete the closing tag manually, making it more work than just typing 'mytag' myself.

It would be more convenient to have code completion just write "<mytag " and (optionally) upon entering ">" a closing tag (only if not "/>"). This would adding attributes and using empty elements a lot easier.
