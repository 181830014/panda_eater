While references to help that is provided by other plug-ins is already supported by means of the "PLUGINS_ROOT/another_plugin_id" notation, it would be nice to have support for providing an alternative url in case the other plug-in is not installed (an the link would thus be broken). 

There may be cases where it is not desired to ensure (by means of a bundle dependency) that the other plugin referenced in the help is actually installed. However, if the plugin is present, it would be preferable to use a local link rather than an absolute URL that points to a server (which is possible via the PLUGINS_ROOT support). 

To support such scenarios, it would be nice if an alternative url could be provided, either by encoding it into the PLUGINS_ROOT-href (which would IMHO be more flexible), or by simply using the alt tag for this purpose (which would probably be easier to realize).
