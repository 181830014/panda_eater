Currently, the edit forms and info boxes for the standard extensions (people, info, devinf etc.) are collected in the o.e.s.view.ext.impl bundle while the corresponding data models/extension services etc. are contained in individual bundles. This should be corrected, since the convention is that an extension bundle should contain everything, i.e. data model, extension service, converters, indexers, data migrators etc. **and** the necessary UI extensions.
