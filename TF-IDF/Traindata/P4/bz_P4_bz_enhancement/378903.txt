Right now, when R4E is executing most commands in ther background, all other commands that may involve writing to the serialization model are disabled.  It could be a bit confusing because since the commands are running in the background it is easy to miss the indicators.

We need better indicators 
- Mouse cursor could be marked as busy when hovering over the navigator and properties view
- An extra progress bar could be added at the bottom of the navigator view to display total progress
- R4E Context-sensitive menu that appear in non-R4E view should be visible but disabled (or its child command disabled).  Ideally, other icons could be used for each command to make it obvious that the commands are disabled because anoter R4E command is executing
