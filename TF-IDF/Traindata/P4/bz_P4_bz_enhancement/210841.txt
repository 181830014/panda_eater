There is a big problem when you create a query from a existing URL: you cannot edit it using the rich query configuration dialog.

The only workaround is to paste the URL in browser, edit using the web UI, and change it in Mylyn.

The mylyn query editor should be able to reverse engineer the query and create a query model able to be edited in Mylyn, even guessing the repository.
