I have about 30 projects and I use 'Export' feature to Jar them, but when I 
move from one to another I right click on a project and choose export and I 
have to select what jar to output to, it would be GREAT if Eclipse could 
remember what the last jar was so I could have it preselected once I right 
click on a project and choose export (and choose JAR).
