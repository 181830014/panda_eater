If I recall correctly, the factory path UI shows both 1.5 and 1.6 processors, regardless of whether Eclipse is currently running on 1.6.  (I might be wrong about that, in which case this bug is invalid - I'm not able to test it right now.)

People are having trouble with processors "not running" because they are trying to run 1.6 processors on 1.5 JVMs.  It would be helpful if the UI distinguished the processor types, perhaps greying out any processors that were unable to run due to the current JVM level.
