It would be nice to see Mylar enforce developers (novice Mylar users) who keep forgeting using a task. Ideally, developers always work with an active task, or they may not care about the work when a task is not active, but the idea here is to ease the adoption of Mylar who are not used to work with tasks.

To do that I may suggest the following. Mylar can collect interaction information in a circular context buffer  (say for last 100 events) when there's no active task. When a user creates and activates a task, Mylar can ask (and no, not like clippy!) "well, it seems that you've done some work before, do you want to use it as your initial context?" and a short list of direct interaction events can be shown to choose the start point. If this feature is too annoying or affects the performance, it can be turned off from the preferences.
