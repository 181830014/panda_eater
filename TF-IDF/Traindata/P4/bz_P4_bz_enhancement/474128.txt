In a VSM, "Java extension" allow to reference service classes by their fully qualified name.
But in expression query field, the service is referenced by its non qualified name.
If two classes have the same method as service, it is not possible to distinguish one from the other in expression query field. At runtime, the one provided by sirius will be the first found.

The enhancement should give the ability, in the expression query field, to refer to the fully qualified name of the service.
