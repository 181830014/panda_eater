As discussed during the review, Mylyn should make it easier to have "Buy Now" like contributions.

Foglyn currently adds this message at following places:
* Repository Settings dialog (at the bottom)
* Query dialog (at the bottom)
* Task Editor -- at the top of the page (next to task ID) using:
           getTaskEditor().setMessage("Foglyn is not registered. Buy now!", IMessageProvider.INFORMATION, new HyperlinkAdapter()  { ... })

   from FoglynTaskEditorPage.createFormContent. When message is updated with error message, foglyn text is hidden (which is OK).
