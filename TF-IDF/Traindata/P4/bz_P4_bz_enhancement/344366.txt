Problem: 
Let procedure foo be contained in the module mod_foo. When the code in the body of foo is changed without any effects on or changes to its interface, it would suffice if only mod_foo was recompiled. However, currently, such a change results in a compilation cascade that recompiles all files that USE mod_foo.

Solution:
It seems there is a very simple solution which only needs a change in the GNU Make commands. Both the problem and the solution are clearly described in

In other bug reports I have argued how important Managed Make is for Photran to distinguish itself from other IDEs and to attract its main audience, namely users with little to medium programming experience. As far as I can see (which is not very far!) the proposed enhancement can have a visible impact at little implementation costs.
