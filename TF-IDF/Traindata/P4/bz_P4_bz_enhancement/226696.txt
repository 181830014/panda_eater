Steps To Reproduce:
Add indicator of per-task status / size in task list.  I like the "Workweek Progress", but it's too high level.  I want to be able to pick out the tasks that will give me the biggest bang for my buck - work on the ones that are easily completed if I only have 30 minutes, or look for a bigger one if I have more time.

There have been a couple of other requests for duration / elapsed / estimated information in the task list, but they aseem to have died (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=126788, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=169884).
