The filename for attachments from the clipboard currently defaults to "clipboard.txt". The filename is editable but it there have been suggestions on bug 193156 for a better default:

- BUGID.patch
- BUGID-summary-delimited-by-dashes.patch
- versioning based on existing attachments, e.g. if adds-feature-foo.patch exists: adds-feature-foo-2.patch
