Mylar 1.0.1

I have "Toggle focused mode" and "manage open editors" preferences turned on, because they are very useful when switching between multiple tasks that are already in progress. But when I activate a newly created Mylar task, the way these options work right now feels pretty counterproductive, because they leave me with a blank package explorer and a blank editor section. So to begin working, I either have to know the class I want to open through the Open Type dialog, or switch off the focused mode on the package explorer, navigate to the package I want, start working, and then after I have built up sufficient context turn the focused mode on again.

This is one of the rare examples when I really feel like Mylar gets in my way. Are there any plans to get this initial UI to be a little more useful instead of a blank slate? For example, I have over 60 projects in my workspace, some 40 of which are required to be open in order for everything to compile properly. But every one of my dozen tasks recently has been in the same 3-4 projects, and I have a feeling this is not such an uncommon situation. Could the focused UI when I activate a new task at least show the union of projects (or maybe packages) that were part of the context of the last several tasks? This way Mylar would actually help to quickly and easily navigate to where chances are the new task is going to take place too, and to build the context from there.
