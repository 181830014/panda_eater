I had had Mylar installed for a couple days before I did anything with it.  At the time, I had quite a few file tabs available for files in my somewhat large project, representing files I've viewed or edited in recent history.

So, I finally opened the task list and created a task (I ended up creating 2), and then re-visiting some files I knew were relevant to those tasks, and setting landmarks in those files.

I then unchecked the radio button for the active task, which I would assume would have taken me out of the active task "mode".  After doing that, my middle content area with all of my file tabs was now completely blank.  Fortunately, the "File" menu had most of those files in the "recent files list", so I didn't have to dig through my package explorer again.

My original list of open tabs is now gone.  I tried restarting the workspace while having no task checked, but they were still gone.
