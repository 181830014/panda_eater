A similar problem as in bug 160107.

Around each of the monitors there is a group with a text repeating the tab title of the monitor . 
This contains no information. Only RSE uses Groups "around" views. I'd suggest to remove it,
or replace it with an information string like in the "Remote Search" or other eclipse views, where
some status information is shown:
  name of the container - number of files - filtered (sorry Subset) files 

That would make sense. 
Actually the "Remote Systems Details" does it correctly (by showing a simple text string and not a Group border)
