Currently in Webkit2, when setUrl(..) is called with PostData, then a workaround is triggered that uses java to make the http request because webkit2 doesn't provide the necessary api for it.

This was implemented here:
527738 â€“ (webkit2portPostData) [Webkit2] implement setUrl(...POST..) support. (snippet 330) 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=527738

However, in the long-run, it would be better to have webkit2 api for this and do this without java. This is the bug to keep track of it.
