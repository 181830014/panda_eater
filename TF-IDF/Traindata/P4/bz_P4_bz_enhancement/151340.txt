It could be a really handy optimization to kick repository suncronization based on the new incoming tasks (Bugzilla, Jira, etc).

Genrally querying issue tracking system is faster then running VCS sync against many projects. And since task information already there and it allows to retrieve contextual data (e.g. affected projects, etc) it could allow to narrow down syncronization scope and kick synchronization only for affected projects, which should speed up VCS syncranization.
