It would be good to have these methods available as helpers in other tests too. Maybe as an assertion library?

import static ...capella.test.transition.ju.TransitionAssertions.*

and then 

assertTransitioned(EObject e)
assertTransitionedAndLinkedTo(String id1, String id2, EStructuralFeature feature)
...
