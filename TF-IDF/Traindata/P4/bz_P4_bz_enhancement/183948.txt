This would remove the burden of having to use the form editor.  As part of this we should also make the flow through the wizard more clear, since we would be support 4 options for creating a query:

2) Retrieving from server
3) From template
4) From URL

To start this could support Bugzilla only, but should be generalized to other connectors
