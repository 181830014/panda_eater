The bugzilla view shows comments in order, but quite a lot of the time when I navigate to (long) bugs, I'm more interested in what the most recent comment is, which I have to scroll down for. It would be good if the bugzilla component could have an option to show the description/comments in reverse order, so that the thing I'm most interested in looking at is at the top. (It would also be good to automatically expand the last comment in each case, too).

Whilst I realise that this might not be desirable for everyone, I'd certainly find it useful.
