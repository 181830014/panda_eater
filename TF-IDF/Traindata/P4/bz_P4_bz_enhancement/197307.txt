A possible solution can be using not org.eclipse.swt.widgets.FileDialog, but creating a generic Dialog that will allow to select the File not only from the external source, but also from the Workspace, as done with "AddAttachment". This dialog will be able to reuse for exporting/importing tasks and contexts.
