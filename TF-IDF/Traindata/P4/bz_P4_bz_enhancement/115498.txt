Since Mylar's context model makes the interaction history that creates a task context
explicit, it is possible to provide a UI that rewinds or replays task context creation.
 This was first suggested by Kai-Uwe Maetzel at OOPSLA 2004.  Possible use cases are recalling
the past few actions when swapping in a context, reviewing tasks, and tutoring.  

The
straightforward implementation would make it impossible to start creating context "in
the past" of the interaction history stream.  But fancier implementations could make it
possible to fork the interaction history.  There is currently a very common use case for
this that I work-around by hitting the pause button and Eugene Kuleshov works around by
hitting "Make less interesting" (bug 115199#2): your exploration diverges by  taking a
wrong turn into something that turns out not to be interesting, and you'd like to rewind
that interaction (discarding the events) and continue from a point in the past.
