It'd be nice if when you drag and drop a file from the package explorer to the editor, the text inserted is the path of that file, relative to the file in the editor you just dropped it to.

For example:
WebContent
-myJSP.jsp
-myFolder
--myFile.jsp

If I drag and drop myFile.jsp onto myJSP.jsp, I would like "myFolder/myFile.jsp" to be inserted.

Currently, the file path relative to the project root is inserted instead: "WebContent/myFolder/myFile.jsp"
