+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #196217 +++

Carried forward from bug 196217 comment 6: When copying or moving a folder to a destination that already has that folder name, desired behavior is to either rename the target folder or to merge the source and the target folders.

The current conflict dialog gives options "Rename" and "Overwrite" which is not totally accurate since the target folder is not totally overwritten or removed, but rather merged with the source.

Another option would be to keep the term "Overwrite" but add a tooltip or other note saying that only those files in the target folder tree are overwritten, which exist with the same name in the source folder -- in other words, describe the merge operation.
