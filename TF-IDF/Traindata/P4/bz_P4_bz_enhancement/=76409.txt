When Help is searched from within the workbench for a text item, the Help 
contents are not scrolled to show the found selection. For long pages, this 
mean manually scrolling the page around to find the found selection.  A visual 
cue in a accompanying column would be very useful (something similar to how 
TODO items are marked in a column in source code editors in Eclipse).
