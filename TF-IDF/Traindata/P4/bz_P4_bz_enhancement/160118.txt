Both views do essentially the same. The only difference is the the Remote Monitor can poll for updates automatically and the Remote System Details can be locked.

And a few menu entries of the Remote System Details are missing in the Remote Monitor.

The unlocking of the Remote System Details could be one special monitor (well a good UI idea is needed here)

Else I see no reason why the two views are separate.
