I'd like to control programmatically where new Editors are opened in the
Editorarea. By default each editor is tabbed behind the previous opened editor,
but I want that each new editor is opened beside the other editor. I want to see
the content of each editor at the same time. Manually after opening I can move
the Editors around to have this result, but I want to do this programmatically
after opening the editor.
The reason for this request is:  I have a RCP App which Editors that contain a
TableViewer. It is possible to Drag & Drop entries of the Table between the
Editors. So it would be really nice to open new Editors beside each other,
instead of tabbing them behind the previous opened.
