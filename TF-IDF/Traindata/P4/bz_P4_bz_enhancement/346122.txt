Directory listings should be enabled for all directories below (including)

E.g. for bug 342697, I need access to the console logs (System.out, not System.err) from the performance tests, and I have no idea where I can find them.

Sometimes, I can find the right directories on the internal build machine where the SDK tests currently run, but right now, no build with performance results is available there, so that trick also doesn't work.
