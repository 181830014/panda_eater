We need to implement buttons in the R4E preferences (group and rule set tabs) to lgive users a way to verify that the group and rule set files locations are valid.  A verification was done previously automatically when starting the R4E Navigator view, but this caused other problems (see bug 347780).  The previous code is commented out but can be reused here as a based that will be completed by adding command code.
