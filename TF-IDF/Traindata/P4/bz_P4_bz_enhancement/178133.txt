Adobe Flex Builder? is an Eclipse? based IDE for developing RIAs. In order to take advantage of all Mylar features a structure bridge would need to be implemented.

Flex is based on XML and the object-oriented language ActionScript (based on ECMAScript), which is similar to Java and C#. Flex Builder currently works with Eclipse 3.2 (and 3.1 under Windows).
