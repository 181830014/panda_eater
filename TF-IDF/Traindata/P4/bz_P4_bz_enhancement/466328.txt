When setting the focus on a diagram editor, we get SubDiagramDecorator.refresh() called for each editPart. And this SubDiagramDecorator.refresh() by calling DialectManager.INSTANCE.getRepresentations() use a ECrossReferenceAdapter.

This bugzilla has been created to check why this refresh is useful and if useful to find a smarter mean to refresh this decorator.

FYI this decorator is used to indicate that from the concerned editPart, there exists some representations to which we could navigate.
