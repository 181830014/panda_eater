When marking task as completed it would make sense to execute following operations:

-- get user comment for completion
-- [optional] commit changes to version control (CVS, Subclipse). Should allow to preview.
-- attach task context task context to issue and also use entered comment
-- resolve issue in issue tracking repository (bugzilla, jira)
-- mark local task as resolved
