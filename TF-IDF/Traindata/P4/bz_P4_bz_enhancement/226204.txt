I am using the jira connector.  When I mark a task as resolved, it often no longer matches my current query, and is immediately moved from my short query list into the huge "unmatched" category, where I have to go find it and deactivate it.  

It would be great if there was a preference that allowed for automatically deactivating tasks once they are marked as resolved or fixed.  

Alternatively, if they didn't move out of the query until being deactivated, this would accomplish the same goal, but might make less sense in terms of a uniform interface.
