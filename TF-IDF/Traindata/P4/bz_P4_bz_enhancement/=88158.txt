1) Have a lot of editors open (one unsaved)
2) invoke "Close All"
3) you are informed (in a dialog) that you have unsaved changes in file 'X.java'

It would be nice, at this point, to be able to jump to file 'X.java' (i.e. bring
the editor to front), for example by double clicking the file in the list in the
dialog.
