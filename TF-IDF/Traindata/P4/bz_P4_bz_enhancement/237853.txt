Bugzilla's Security can be setup such that a user can see a bug but not have the necessary privilages to retrieve repository configuration. In this scenario, the attributes should just be text fields (not combo boxes) as a fail safe.  Also ideally supporting submission of changes (assuming a valid entry was made).
