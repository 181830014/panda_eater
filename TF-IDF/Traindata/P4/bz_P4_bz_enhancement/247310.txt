Screenshot of Intended Action

I tried to reorder the list of tasks for the day so that I could handle one by one but in vain was not able to do so.

Procedure
---------
1. Create task1, task2, task3, ... taskN all having the same priority. Currently, the tasks are displayed in the order of creation.
ie.
	task1
	task2
	task3
2. Now move task1 between task2 and task3. Attached is a screenshot of the intended action.
ie.
	task2
	|----|		<---- task1
	task3

Actual Result
-------------
I am able to see the re-position bar appearing between task2 and task3 as noticed in the screenshot, but the action there is "No Change" in the Task List UI

Expected Result
---------------
	task2
	task1
	task3
