I have few Bugzilla queries with large number of hits and as a consequence a very large archive category. In result, task synchronization is really slow and looks like it is running one task at a time.

Is there some way to get all the details for multiple issues in one roundtrip?

Few other things to notice:

Label for task synchronozation Job look really weird. You could perhaps use ":" to separate actual task name (by the way, it does not have task id?) from "Synchronizing" prefix (if you need that prefix at all)

During that synchronization Task List is flickering every second (repository labels on queries disappear and then reappear again). I have it all collapsed and there is only 3 queries in the Task List and yet it is very annoying

Popup dialog with incoming task notifications reapper too often. Shouldn't it be shown at the end of synchronization? I recall we had an issue about this, as well as about dialog sizes and I've suggested to only show number of changed tasks and have simple link to jump into the Task List view in workweek mode. Nobody commented there.
