Making the sometimes walls of text caused by the communications unreadable and unsearchable, adding formatting and filtering options to the logging preference give the addition of readability but the downside of possibly obscuring errors.

Having possibly formatting applied to one output, but ensuring that another output will always have the raw stream could help developers take the first steps towards solving problems and communicating issues.

Filter/Formatting ideas:
Hide "Content-Length: X" messages
Add timestamps to communications
Format JSON communication to be more readable
Filter by message type
