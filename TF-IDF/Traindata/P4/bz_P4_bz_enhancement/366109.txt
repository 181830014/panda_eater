When performing a review, when a user has completed his part of the review, he can send an e-mail to the review lead to let him know that he has completed his review. It would be nice to have a decorator beside the participant to know who has completed his review, he consider the review as a pass or fail. So at a glimpse, we would know who has completed and who hasn't but just look at the participants of the review and what is the feeling of the reviewers.
