the bug 481849 is the first step to have only RepresentationDescription meta-models in the scope of validation, completion and runtime.
That bug handle the validation aspects.
This ticket is about completion aspect.

The 
org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.interpreter.JavaExtensionsManager.reloadEPackages() method add EPackage found in the VSP dependecies.

JavaExtensionsManager is instanciated by AcceleoAbstractInterpreter and ServiceInterpreter that are IInterpreter.
These IInterpreter are created(indirectly) by the singleton CompoundInterpreter.INSTANCE.

The problem is the CompoundInterpreter is used for completion and for the runtime as well.
Finally, the question handle this ticket is how to manage the JavaExtensionsManager behavior for completion but not for run-time.
