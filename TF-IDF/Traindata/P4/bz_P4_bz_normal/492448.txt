It looks like there is room for some judicious trimming of the Gerrit builds for the Tooling on the master branch, to improve turn-around time.  In particular,

* reduce the number of platform configurations built for RCP/product builds, and/or
* use profiles to exclude RCP/product builds altogether for changes that don't touch their actual configurations

The mailing list discussion linked in the URL field has some helpful feed-back and pointers to builds that have addressed this or similar issues.
