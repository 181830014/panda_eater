On an ssh command shell, create a directory without permissions:
  mkdir notpermitted
  touch notpermitted/test.txt
  chmod 0 notpermitted

* After pressing refresh, try to expand the "notpermitted" node
  --> no error message is shown.
  --> Would expect an error "permission denied".

* Select any file, choose copy. Select the "notpermitted" dir, choose paste.
  --> An exception is printed to stderr
  --> Would expect an error dialog to pop up

In the second case, the problem most probably is, that there is no Shell to show the error dialog in.
