@Entity
public class PropertyRecord {
    @Id
    int id;

    @ElementCollection
    // @MapKey(name="size")
    @MapKeyColumn(name="size")
    Map<Integer, PropertyInfo> parcels;
}

@Embeddable
public class PropertyInfo {
	Integer parcelNumber;
	Integer size;
	BigDecimal tax;
}

I attempted to generate tables with the above classes and got SQLSyntaxErrorException: Column name 'SIZE' appears more than once in the CREATE TABLE statement.  The proper way to specify this would be with a MapKey instead of a MapKeyColumn, but since the spec says that MapKey is not meant for Embeddable relationships someone could attempt to set the map key column in this manner.
