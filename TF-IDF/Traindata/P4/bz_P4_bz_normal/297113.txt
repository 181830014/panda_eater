The JPA inheritance model of requiring the entire hierarchy to be of one type is very restrictive.

We seem to allow overriding the inheritance type to some degree, but it does not seem to work as expected.

Overriding single-table to joined, does not result in the subclass having its own table, but does result in its subclasses having their own table.  It should result in the class having its own table.  You should also be able to add single-table in a joined subclass to avoid the table being defined.

table-per-class in a subclass should result in it being detached from its parents hierarchy (inherit mappings, but not parent class set in descriptor), instead an error occurs stating no indicator was defined for the table-per-class descriptor.
