There are still several missing session/login properties from the persistence unit properties.  This frequently come up now and then on the forums, and I have to refer users to using code.

We should allow everything that is supported to be configured through JPA persistence unit properties.

Some things missing are: (but check and include everything from DatasourceLogin, DatabaseLogin, ServerSession)
- stream binding
- ping sql, tries, delay
- cache isolation level
- table qualifier
- default null values
- string binding, size
- trim strings
- optimize data conversion
- transaction isolation level
- external transactions/pooling
