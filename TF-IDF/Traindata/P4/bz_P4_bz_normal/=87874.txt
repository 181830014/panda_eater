- Create editor that provides custom icon depending on input (in
IEditorInput.getImageDescriptor())
- Open a number of such editors in one workbook (3 at least)
- Close workbench
- Open workbench
=> Editors that are not yet restored (dormant) show default icon for this editor
flavour; when user selects such editor then icon is updated.

Proposed solution is to allow editor input factory to save image type in memento
and later use it to return correct image descriptor.
