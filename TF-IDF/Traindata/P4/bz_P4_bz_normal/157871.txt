Scenario: I have several widgets:
Container - widget that can contain other widgets
WidgetA - can be placed on Diagram only
WidgetB - can be placed on the diagram and into container widget.

I update the model to allow WidgetA to be placed on the diagram and into container widget, and I update the gmf mapping. After generation some of the old diagram files cannot be opened. I'm not sure where is the problem, maybe it's  because of different VisualID Nodes.
