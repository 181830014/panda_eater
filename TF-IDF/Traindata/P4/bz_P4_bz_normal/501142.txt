The client-context selectors generated for the System Elements profile validation, for bug 477721, are too imprecise in two respects:

* the selector's matching logic is based on the simple stereotype name only.
  It does not account for stereotypes of the same name in other profiles from
  unrelated applications

* the client-context ID is not qualified, being based solely on the stereotype name.
  Again, this needs some qualifier to distinguish the client-context ID from those
  registered by other unrelated profiles

These problems can be fixed "by hand" but I reference the related code generator bug as blocking it because re-generation presumably would undo such changes.  It would be preferable to fix to the code generator and use that to regenerate these client-contexts (which also depends then on the nature of that fix).
