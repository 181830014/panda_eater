Create a Java project.
Create 2 packages: pack1 and pack2.
Create a new package named pack1 inside pack2.
Create two file in pack1.
Create two files with the same name as the previous two in pack2.pack1.
Mark the first file in pack2.pack1 as read-only.

Drag pack1 and drop it on pack2, you will be informed that the folder already 
exists and asked for a confirmation to overwrite. Press 'Yes to all'. The 
expected behaviour is that the folder has been overwritten but in fact it 
remained the same. Even though the second file is not read-only, it has not 
been overwritten. The log file does not show any exceptions.

I tried to mark the second file in pack2.pack1 read-only instead of the first, 
and even the first file was not overwritten in that case.
