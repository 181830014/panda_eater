I cannot disable binding on the coalesce operator.

Symfoware does not allow input parameters in the select list, so the following test fails:

org.eclipse.persistence.testing.tests.jpa.criteria.JUnitCriteriaSimpleTestSuite.simpleCoalesceInSelectTest

The generated SQL is:

COALESCE(t0.F_NAME,t0.L_NAME,? ) FROM CMP3_EMPLOYEE t0, CMP3_SALARY t1
WHERE ((t0.F_NAME = ?) AND (t1.EMP_ID = t0.EMP_ID)) bind => [Bobby, Bob]

I have tried calling operator.setIsBindingSupported(false); on ExpressionOperator.coalesce() before adding the operator in the Symfoware platform's initializePlatformOperators() method, but still an input parameter was used.

Following James' suggestion (who said the coalesce operator can't be overridden in the database platform implementation), I added exOperator.setIsBindingSupported(false); in org.eclipse.persistence.expressions.ExpressionOperator#coalesce(), but still the argument 'Bobby' was bound.

Requesting a way to allow binding to be turned off with the coalesce operator.
