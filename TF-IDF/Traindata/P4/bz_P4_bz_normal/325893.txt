Recently tested TopLink MBean in trunk(2.2.0), and found that:
(1) all the attributes and operations don't have descriptions to explain what the attribute is for and what this operation is about
(2) for parameters, that have no description as well, so it's hard for customers to figure out what values should entered there.
