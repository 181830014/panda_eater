When values are obtained by method "getOrInvokeMultiValued" from "IFacetManager". The returned collection don't manage the fOpposite: no resolution on adding new value by method "add" on the collection.

The fix is create new collection extending EList, with an override on add method to manage fOpposite (call "manageFOpposite" method on FacetManager implementation).
This collection must be return by the method getOrInvokeMultiValued.
