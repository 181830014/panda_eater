Currently there are two ways to change EclipseLink's default id validation behaviour to treat zero as an invalid pk number.  One is by setting it on the descriptor.  

The other is to use a static that was always only intended to be a back door.  The issue with setting the static is that it has implications on other applications running in the same VM.  

The main issue with setting this flag (static or descriptor) is that sequencing will no longer engage on primitives.  

This setting needs a project level setting, configuration from EMF properties.
