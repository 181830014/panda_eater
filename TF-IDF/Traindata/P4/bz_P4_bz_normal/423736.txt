parsed rdf content, log and stacktrace

Trying to read a Requirement from DOORS leads to an infinite loop. It seems that the rdf content returned from DOORS has malformed XSD datetimes (e.g. 2013-11-04). 
However, the error handling in the MessageBodyReader runs into an infinite loop.

I attached the rdf content, the log and the stack trace to this bug report.
