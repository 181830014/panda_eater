Comment from Bruce MacIsaac:

It is unclear where the work items get created.
I'm thinking that:
    - some work items are created by the project manager to cover "planned"  task or activities as defined in the project process for the iteration type
    - some tasks/activities, as as "develop solution increment" are implied by the requirements that have been defined for the system, so prioritizing the requirements
      for the iteration implicitly defines work items for this type "provided the scenario has already been detailed".
      If the scenario has NOT been detailed, then high priority work items of this type should be defined for prioritized requirements.
      I'm assuming that we prioritize requirements as work items, and then do a standard decomposition for scenarios into:
        detail the scenario
        develop solution increment
      - I suspect that in the meeting, high level objectives for the iteration are typically decomposed into lower level work items as part of the planning,
      while some decomposition might occur after the meeting.
      - The key is to tell a complete story that connects with the tasks and activities defined in the process
      This may become a bit lengthy - perhaps warrants a guideline, or merging with "prioritizing work items".
