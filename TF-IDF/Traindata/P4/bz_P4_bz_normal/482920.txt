When testing Bug 474482 which makes the capsule structure diagram synchronized/canonical, it shows that the auto layout needs some improvement to avoid that ports end up on each other and capsule parts could be placed more intelligent within the current size of the capsule structure diagram.

Steps to reproduce:

1) Create a UML-RT model
2) Create capsule in the model explorer
3) Open the capsule structure diagram of the capsule to make it visible
4) Create a port for this capsule from the UMLRealTime new child menu in model explorer (either selecting an existing protocol or create a new one)
5) Observer how it is placed in the top left cornet of the capsule
6) Create a second port
7) Observe how the port is positioned in the same location as the first port

It should be made sure that the ports does not end up on top of each other to avoid the cluttering.

Creating capsule parts works better. They don't end up on each other, but they seem to simpley be placed further and further to left and slightly lower down each time, causing a scroll bar to appear for the capsule. It is preferred if the layout algorithm tries to use the existing space as much as possible, for example by placing the capsule parts in rows and columns, until the complete space is filled (in which case scroll bars is unavoidable).
