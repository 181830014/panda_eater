AbstractTreeViewerTest defines a method :
protected abstract int getItemCount(TestElement element);

This method is used in various tests in order to ensure the correct number of
children for a given item.  However, 2 of the 3 subclasses define this method to
return 0.  As it happens, 0 == 0 pretty much every time.  These should be fully
implemented in order for the tests to be meaningful.
