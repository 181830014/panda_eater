If you work on a project for one language, then create another project and run the New Programming language descriptor wizard, the language field of the wizard will be initialized with the name of the language from the previous project.

I thought I'd fixed all of these initialization glitches, but I guess not.

This appears with both Eclipse 3.1 and 3.2.
