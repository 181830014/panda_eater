1) If your widget has a client area (e.g. overrides computeSize()) then when 
anything happens that could change the size of the client area (e.g. scrollbars 
appear/disappear, font changes and changes the size of the header area) then 
a "fake" SWT.Resize event should be sent to all your children.  Be careful 
because when you use notifyListeners, the SWT.Resize event will also get sent 
to your widget if you are listening for the SWT.Resize event.
