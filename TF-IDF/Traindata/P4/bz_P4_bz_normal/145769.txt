I am seeing problems if I have one AJ project depend on another outjar project. I think this has something to do with updating the refeernces to include the jar file and not removing references to old jar files when project references are removed. 

For example, see the attached two projects in a sample workspace. I created this problem by changing the outjar location of the dependent project to remove it then add it back.
