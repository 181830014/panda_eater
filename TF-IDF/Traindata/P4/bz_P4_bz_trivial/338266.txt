Improve icon used to indicate a task is scheduled in the task editor header. Currently the icon used is the same as used for today in the dropdown. That they are the same is quite confusing. It also sets up the expectation that the this week icon will appear in the header when the task is scheduled for this week, which would probably be a good thing, but which is not the case.

Ideally, there would be a different icon for each of the options in the dropdown, and the icon for the chosen date would appear in the header, and there would be a generic "scheduled" icon for dates further in the future.

A simpler solution would just be to remove the icon that appears next to today in the dropdown, and show that icon in the header when the task is scheduled for anything other than this week, and the this week icon when scheduled for this week.
