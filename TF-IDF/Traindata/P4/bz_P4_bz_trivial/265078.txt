while this is not a problem when the user guide is installed into Eclipse, the wiki-based version has no references to WikiText.  It makes sense for at least some mention of WikiText to be present, probably in the "Configuring Task Repositories":http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn/User_Guide#Configuring_Task_Repositories section
