We have a derived data type called CCTK_INT and CCTK_REAL and variables of their type. The photran refactor engine cannot locate the declaration of the variable and collapses then for the other variables of the direct type too. The AST is hampered I guess.
Then the next bug is F90 and CPP are not working well especially with the comments like /*@@. the outline windows shows syntaxException showing the unexpected /.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just create a new derived data type in a file and use the derived data type in another file and do locate declaration.
2.Create a fortran project with cpp files and comment some lines such as /*@@ you get to see the unexpected / as syntax exception in outline window.
3.
