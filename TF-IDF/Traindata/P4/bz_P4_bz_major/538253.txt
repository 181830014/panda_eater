The java files with the example from description.

Trying to override a method with an argument which is a generic array of ? extends SomeGenericRawType leads to the following errors:

1.
Name clash: The method method(Class<? extends List>...) of type SubClass has the same erasure as method(Class<? extends List>...) of type BaseClass but does not override it

2.
The method method(Class<? extends List>...) of type SubClass must override or implement a supertype method

------
Here a small example:

public class BaseClass {

    public String method(Class<? extends List>... classes) {
        return null;
    }
}

public class SubClass extends BaseClass {

    @Override
    public String method(Class<? extends List>... classes) {
        return null;
    }
}

------
The compile errors would not apprear if the argument is not an array, so the <? extends RawType> seems to be allowed and considered, but not for arrays.

------
The oracle compiler has no problem with the example above.

------
When changing the example the following way (make List not being a raw type, List<?>), the .class file looks the same, but there are no compile errors:


public class BaseClass {

    public String method(Class<? extends List<?>>... classes) {
        return null;
    }
}

public class SubClass extends BaseClass {

    @Override
    public String method(Class<? extends List<?>>... classes) {
        return null;
    }
}
