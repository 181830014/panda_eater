When repositories are updated to a new version or the supported feature set of a connector changes it can be desirable to update the offline data or tasks in the task list without causing an incoming notification. This has also been raised on the mylyn-integrators mailing list:

http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/mylyn-integrators/msg00537.html: new version of connector now fetches more data than previous one, and creates some new attributes. I'd like to force fetching this new data for all existing user's tasks (which don't have new attributes yet), but I prefer not to indicate that there is incoming data for every task, because this would break existing 'state of tasks' for user.
