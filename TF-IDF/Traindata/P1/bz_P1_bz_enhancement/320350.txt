When a task is first activated by a user who is not familiar with the task-focused interface, and has not learned about workspace focusing via one of the tutorial mechanisms, the effect can feel overly disruptive in the navigator views such as the Package Explorer.  We could bring up a one-time dialog on first activation that educates the user on this feature, and provides an overview of related functionality, such as the context quick view.
