There needs to be a way to create a new palette and to add custom Java Beans to 
this new or to an existing palette.

Currently the only way to "drag-and-drop" a new component is to use "Choose 
Bean", type in the name of the bean and then add it from there.

For visual editing developers this is too slow, not intuitive, and not in line 
with all the other IDEs (JBuilder/Netbeans/etc).

Thanks
