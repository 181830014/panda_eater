When opening visual (Swing) code created in NetBeans, the Visual Editor shows 
the components in a frame pretty messed up, as if they are not inside the 
frame. I understand that this is due to differences in the code that the VE 
creates from the code NetBeans creates (I researched this in the newsgroups). 
It seems that the code differences are minor, but tedious to apply manually. 
The VE should either simply make the changes for me, or ask me if I would like 
it to make them.
