Add support for sharing a single TaskDataModel object across multiple tabs
in a task editor that extend AbstractTaskEditorPage.

Currently each AbstractTaskEditorPage creates a new task data model in the
createModel method.  If a new task is created it appears that the data model
from the tab contributing the submit button will be used which will result
in missing field values for fields modified on the other tab since task data
is used from the first tab.
