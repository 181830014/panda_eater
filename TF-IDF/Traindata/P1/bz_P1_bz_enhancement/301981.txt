Currently the tooltip that is displayed in the C Editor when hovering over an item that is defined in a .xdc spec file and has CDOC help associated with it only displays the Name, Prototype, Description, Package and Include information.  It would greatly improve ease of use of XDC functions and events if the parameter info (@param, @a(return)) that is entered in the XDC spec file's autodoc comments and is included in the generated CDOC text was also included in the tooltip.  i.e. The same info that is available in XGCONF should be presented as hover help in the C editor.
