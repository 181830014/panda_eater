We would like to be able to share mylyn contexts without the requirement of the project needing to be named the same.  We have 20+ developers that work on 100+ projects and it is difficult to require everyone to name their projects the same.

Even if this is some sort of manual mapping, that is more desireable than not being able to use Mylyn at all.
