If "Use Toolchain Path" is selected in the toolchain tab for the debug configuration, the interface to the GNAT debugger currently executes gdb using the PATH environment variable to find the gdb executable.  This could result in using the wrong gdb executable if the desired installation does not occur first in the PATH environment variable.
