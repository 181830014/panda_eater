running of master

Steps:
1. create a new Gerrit repo
2. for Server enter "https://android-review.googlesource.com"
3. use your Google ID and password, don't check OpenId checkbox
4. validate

=> IS: got ambiguous error message saying "Invalid repository: OK" (sic!)
=> SHOULD BE: I guess a suggestion to use the OpenID should displayed, or at least the error message should be rephrased
