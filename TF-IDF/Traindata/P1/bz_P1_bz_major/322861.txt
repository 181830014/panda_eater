Currently when we initialize the properties on the RhinoDebugger side of things we do so as a flat list of properties - combining the properties from the current Context with those from the global / prototype Contexts. 

We should better cache these properties so that we can show them in the variable view more sanely - instead of one huge listing of all properties. We also need to serialize them better for clients to make sense of the scope of the properties.
