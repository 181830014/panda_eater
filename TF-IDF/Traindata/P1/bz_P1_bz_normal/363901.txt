When toggling comments ~20-30 lines of code (or more) I do get a Process-Window that shows me how much of the lines are toggled yet. This is weird, compared to JavaScript or Java comments toggling (where 300+ loc is no problem).

I'll toggle by keyboard shortcut (cmd+7).

Can you speed that up and don't show the process window anymore.

Reproducible: Always
