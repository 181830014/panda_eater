Display/Synchronization Bug:
Use two editors at the same time (The Ecore Editor and another model editor). Have a class that contains an arbitrary (but valid) Reference or Attribute. Delete the field in the other Editor and switch back to the Ecore Editor. The field is still displayed in the Ecore Editor and can be edited. BUT: The edit does not make the Ecore file "dirty" and therefore the changes cannot be saved. When the Ecore Editor is reopened, everything is displayed correctly (the deleted field is not present).
