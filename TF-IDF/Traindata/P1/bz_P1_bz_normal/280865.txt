Current method to add an entry to a map config param is
to double-click the top level of the config param.

This is unintuitive -- there's no visible hint to the user at
all. Better alternatives are to add a right-click menu, or a
toolbar button, or a blank line for a new entry (like the CCS
watch window does).
