Here are some improvement suggestions for the IDE Tooling:
- The Attachments should be removed from the context menu
- The Attachments should be displayed as a table with detail
- The "Generate Controls" should be renamed to "Create Control"
- "Generate Control" should be the first entry in the list
- Menu Entries should be grouped
- The menu should have maximal 6 entries, as it is to big otherwise
