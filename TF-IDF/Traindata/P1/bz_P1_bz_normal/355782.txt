The runtime uses Calendar objects to represent both dates and timestamps.  The runtime method for converting dates and timestamps to strings is EString.asString(Calendar).  The method needs to convert dates and timestamps using different formats, but it can't tell the difference between a Calendar for a date and a Calendar for a timestamp("yyyyMMdd").

See the testcase from bug 355163.
