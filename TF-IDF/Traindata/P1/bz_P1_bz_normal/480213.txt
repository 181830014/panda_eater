The TMD API was designed to customize the tree and the contents that get displayed. It is no rare use case that children are filtered. When all children of a node are hidden, we don't want to show the expand indication in the TreeViewer. For this to work out of the box, we need to set ExpandPreCheckFilters to true on the treeviewer.
