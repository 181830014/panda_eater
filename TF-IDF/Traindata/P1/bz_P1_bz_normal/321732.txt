Templates have variables that can be resolved to set of proposals. This functionality was there in the XQDT DLTK Editor. For example:

1. inserting a validation template:
validate validation_mode { expression }
"validation_mode" must be resolved to { "lax", "strict" }

2. inserting an "as" template:
as sequence_type
"sequence_type" must be resolved to { "item()", "node()", "text()", "empty-sequence()", ...}
