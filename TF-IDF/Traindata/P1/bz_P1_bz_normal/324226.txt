xdc-w tree series adds a capability to build applications using shared configurations. Specifically the 'addConfiguration' method of xdc.bld.PackageContents allows users to build applications by referring to prebuilt configurations and as a result reduce applications build time. 

The 'configuro' tool should be revised to use this shared configuration infrastructure. Ideally all our internal benchmark tests should be built using 'configuro' to mimick end customer behavior.
