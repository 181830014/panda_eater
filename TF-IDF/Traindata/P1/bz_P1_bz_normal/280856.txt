Drop down menus for function pointers are populated with
functions matching the signature of the config param, that
can be found anywhere in the configuration. These are rarely
the functions that the user wants to select, and are mostly
unrelated internal functions.

If anything, the list should be populated with functions with
matching signatures found in the user's application, extracted
using CDT PDOM.
