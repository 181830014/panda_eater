Adding to the end of an array hard-codes the index, can fail
if the index is not always the same â€“ use $add() instead.

Arrays can have various semantics. Some arrays allow the
user to add to the end of the array, others have fixed
length.

Maybe let the module writer signal which case is which
by $sealing the length property of the array, in the case of
fixed-length arrays. The script can also then embed array
indexes.
