The steps to reproduce the bug are similar to bug 240636. 

1. Activate a task
2. Open a bunch of files.
3. Deactivate the task and reactivate it.
4. Switch between files clicking on tabs or ctrl+clicking on symbols or ctrl+tabbing, etc.
5. Sometimes, the editor will switch to the new file and immediately go back to the old file.

Combined with bug 240636, this makes Mylyn a bit annoying to use in the first moments of usage. I was not able to reproduce the problem with JDT.
