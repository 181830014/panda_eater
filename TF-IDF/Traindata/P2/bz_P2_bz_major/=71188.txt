awt.Container.components handles errors on setting or instantiating a child by
actually putting the error on the child and not on the parent. This way the
child's editpart displays the error symbol. Then on reinstantiation we actually
ask the child are you valid for this feature before we try to apply again.

Composite and Table don't do this so if there are any errors applying a child it
tries over and over. Plus the error isn't noted on the child.
