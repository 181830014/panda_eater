I am using Dynamic Mapping. For primtive type(DirectField Mapping), org.eclipse.persistence.internal.dynamic.DynamicPropertiesInitializatonPolicy.initializeDefaultValue() sets default value(0) for primitive type. At least, there should be option not to initialize primitive type. My application distiguish null value from default value(0). "null" means nothing is entered. "0" could be a meaningful value for client.

I cloud have worked around this by explicitly setting null to each properties. But null is not allowed for primitive type(https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=393500). So there is no work around for this.
