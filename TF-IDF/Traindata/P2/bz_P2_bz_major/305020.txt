In the case of adding a relationship attribute to a FetchGroup EclipseLink currently loads the any required columns in the initial select and in the case of a LAZY fetch relationship simply populates the proxy. 

When a user specifies a relationship in a FetchGroup that relationship MUST be populated in the entities returned from the query. This is intended to allow a user to specify LAZY relationship that must be populated in the result of the query including 1:1, M:1, M:M, 1:M, Enbeddables, and Element collections.
