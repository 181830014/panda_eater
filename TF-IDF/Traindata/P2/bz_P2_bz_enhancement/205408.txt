Working on Web Projects, the java files I often work with are all nicely grouped together on top of my project (and under "Java Resources" in project explorer), regardless of where the java root folders are physically in my project folder hierarchy.

It would by nice to have the same virtual shortcuts for web context root folders, for example by grouping them together as "Web Resources".

The linked folder feature is not really an alternative, as you see all resources double.
