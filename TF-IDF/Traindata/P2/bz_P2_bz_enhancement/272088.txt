Known issues that could come up if the user were not careful about what they share:
* Orphaned context elements won't show up in the preview
* A preview is not forced or encouraged
* InteractionEvent objects have time stamps, which are not needed for context sharing, only for timing activities
* The user cannot control which kinds of elements are shared (e.g., document access vs. source code access)
