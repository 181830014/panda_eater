Recently with bug 268434 I've had to interact with the Mylyn team around potential bugs in a task context.  The team asked for my task context, however it contains references to code that are proprietary to our project and cannot be disclosed publicly.  It would be useful to have an 'Export Obfuscated Task Context' function that would export the task context while renaming files and code elements so that no confidential information is contained in the exported task context.
