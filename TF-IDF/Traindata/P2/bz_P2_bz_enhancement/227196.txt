I selected a large chunk of tasks that I didn't care about to mark as read, but accidentally selected a query that I did care about.  All of the selected tasks and tasks in the query were marked as read and I had no way to determine what tasks I hadn't read in my query.  It would be nice to have undo support for these operations, but at the very least, when a user performs an operation like mark as read on a query, they should be asked for confirmation (like when a user deletes something from the tasklist).
