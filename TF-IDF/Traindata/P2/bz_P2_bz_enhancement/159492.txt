With the rapid adoption of XML as the lingua franca for business information exchange, and for the exchange of information within an application, a large number of developers would like the output of a report delivered in XML. This would make it easy to integrate report content into other applications. Thus support for XML output is essential to the adoption of BIRT across a range of applications. This project provides an easy way to output a BIRT report as XML of-the-box.
