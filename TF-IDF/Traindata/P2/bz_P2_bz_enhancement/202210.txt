Discussed on bug 200851.  Disconnected repositories will currently synch when the users invokes a synch (e.g. via F5) or when they open a bug.  They should instead respect the disconnected status.  If a synch is forced on a query or task that's disconnected a message should come up instructing the user to update the connection state in the Task Repositories view.
