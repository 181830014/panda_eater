Build Identifier: 

I am repeatedly working offline commenting tasks, changing properties of it etc. So a pile of local changes builds up. Unfortunately there's no way to submit all local changes through a single action/keyboard shortcut so that I have to reiterate through all of them and submit them one by one which reduces the value of the offline edit feature quite a bit.

Reproducible: Always
