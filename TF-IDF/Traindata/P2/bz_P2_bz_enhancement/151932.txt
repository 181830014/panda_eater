Removing a capability pattern from the configuration view because it contains variability activities makes a lot of sense, because you do not want user to apply them as patterns.  However, users might be surprised about this behaviour.  Hence, we needs to warn the user with a dialog that pops up when you create the variability relationship telling the user that the pattern will no longer be visisble in the Config View, but only the Lib View.  It should have a check box saying "Don't warn me again."
