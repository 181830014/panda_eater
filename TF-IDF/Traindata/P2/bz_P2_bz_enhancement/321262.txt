Focus buttons are only enabled when a task is active and do not provide value otherwise. Since Mylyn contributes a focus button to most views in Eclipse the UI can appear more cluttered once Mylyn is installed. This is particularly visible in e4 which has a more simplified look than 3.x (see screenshots)
