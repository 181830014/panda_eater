Steps to reproduce:

- Open a bug in the bug editor.
- Press tab to navigate through the fields.
- Something happens when you get to the attributes comboboxes that you cannot focus them and apparently the focus goes to the editor itself, since the arrow keys scroll the editor up/down instead of through the combo values.
