When the Ant task was first implemented, we copied the command fragments (containing the commands and data mapping) for the wizard and created a seperate one for Ant: AntServiceRootCommandFragment and AntClientRootCommandFragment.  There weree some Ant specific commands that were added as well.

So now, when the wizard's command fragment and data mapping needs to be changed, we need to remember to do the same for the Ant fragments.  This manual step is easy to forget and can be error prone.  We should redesign this so that the Ant tasks could reuse command fragment and mappings from the wizard as much as possible.
