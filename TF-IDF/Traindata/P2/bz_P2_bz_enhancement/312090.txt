In the JPA structure the sorting of entities/attributes is not deterministic.  We should have an option to sort alphabetically.  We could also group entities in packages in the orm.xml.  In the project explorer the orm.xml files need to be separate from the java files.

At the least we should be forcing a logical order, even better would be to let the user choose the order (alphabetical, same order as the file, group by packages).  We also need to decide where virtual attributes belong: interspersed with the specified attributes, after all specified attributes?  Also would those match the order of the underlying java file?
