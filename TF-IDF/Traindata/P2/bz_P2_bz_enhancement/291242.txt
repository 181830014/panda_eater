I set a bunch of queries to disable automatic synchronization. However to my surprise I noticed that the tasks in those folders are still providing updates. This is welcome surprise for me but probably not so much for the server as I got 10 min sync interval set. When I point the cursor to the query it shows the time when I synchronized it last manually. But the individual tasks are getting more recent updates. If this is a feature please explain. Also, I noticed multiple duplicate notifications. Is it because I got the task once in a query and another time in categorized folder?
