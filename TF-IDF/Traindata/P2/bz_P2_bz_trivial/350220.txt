If an Entity's field is marked with both:
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
@NotNul
An exception will be thrown on commit.
Removing the "@NotNull" annotation fixes that. But of course it then no longer matches the table exactly and this annotation is added on generation when mapping against a table.
