When static weaving is enabled BeansBinding (JSR-295) is no longer working.
When i set the "eclipselink.weaving.internal" property to false in my peristence.xml everything is working as expected.

As already extensively discussed with Tom Ware on eclipselink-users mailing list, i am opening this bug and provide a demo project which allows to easily see the bug here:

BeansBinding and EclipseLink static weaving were working perfectly together until version 1.0.2 of EclipseLink. Upgrading to EclipseLink 1.1 broke BeansBinding.

You can find our discussion, which describes the bug here:
