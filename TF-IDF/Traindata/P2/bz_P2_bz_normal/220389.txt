EclipseLink should allow users to create entity managers using different user names for an entity manager factory.

We should support this in 2 ways.

1. (Simple) User provides properties to either the createEntityManagerFactory() call or to the createEntityManager() call that specify an alternate username and password.  In this case, we create all the structures necessary to provide and EM or EMF using that authentication information under the covers and provide the user with the desired construct.

2. (Advanced) User provides an alternate session name as a persistence unit property and any other persistence unit properties that will be overridden in the call to createEntityManagerFactory() or createEntityManager().  EclipseLink creates a new session with that name that uses the combination of the information in the persistence unit and in the overrides to create a whole new session.
