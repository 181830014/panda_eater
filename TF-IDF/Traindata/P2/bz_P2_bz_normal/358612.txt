I get a DataAccessor not connected exception when using cursors in a transaction context repeatedly.
My write connection is closed after 2 queries and I get said DataAccessor disconnected exception. I also think I found the bug in the code, in ClientSession.java, method releaseReadConnection.

        // If the cursor's connection is the write connection, then do not release it.
        if ((this.writeConnections != null) && this.writeConnections.containsKey(connection)) {

However, the last containsKey should probably be containsValue - I changed it and the bug disappears here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use cursors in a transaction-environment
2. query several times, the third fails, maybe depending on the number of setup write connections
3.
