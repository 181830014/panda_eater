Projects that use JavaScript can expect to require many dozens or hundreds of relatively fine grained JavaScript "libraries". Creating a CQ for each library is time consuming both for committers and for the IP Team and--at least in the case of projects that require license certification only--not particularly valuable.

With the introduction of Type A IP due diligence, we have an opportunity to make review a little easier for all parties. We've started rolling this out with some test projects, and so should update the handbook to include discussion of this exception.

A single CQ can be used for some coherent grouping of JavaScript files (potentially from multiple sources) when:

* Type A due diligence will be applied; 
* The aggregated content represents a coherent "thing"; and
* The source (i.e. unminified) files for all content is included.

A "coherent grouping" (or coherent "thing") means that the files must all be somehow related. They could be, for example, some bit of JavaScript along with the transitive closure of all of its dependencies. The coherent grouping should have a name (e.g. "Electron") and version which should be used as the description of the CQ.

Attach a single ZIP file to the CQ that includes all source content. Manifests, when available can also be included. In a comment on the CQ, include a list of the files by name.

Note that piggyback CQs are not supported for CQs of this nature. Exceptions may be granted at the IP Team discretion.

Take careful note that this applies only for Type A (license certification) due diligence.
