The code developed for bug 209227 needs to be setup so that the plug-in jar built is packaged so it can be invoked on the classpath.  The use case for this is the adopter who wishes to use the CMDBf query and registration framework.  That code needs its exception classes to derive from COSMOSException, but those classes are packaged as separate modules.  To keep the footprint small for that scenario, the common COSMOS code also needs to be built as a small module that can be accessed by other modules.
