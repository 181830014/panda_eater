I have a Generic JPA 2.0 project with 1 java class Foo that is listed in the orm.xml. Rename Foo.java to XXX.java and allow the refactoring to rename the reference in the orm.xml file. Now delete XXX.java and don't delete the reference in the orm.xml file. You do not get a validation error that the referenced XXX in the orm.xml file does not resolve to a class.

In GenericJpaProject.externalJavaResourceCompilationUnits the JavaResourceType for the XXX IType was added to this collection when Foo.java was originally renamed. This is because of the order of events, the orm.xml context model is updated before the jpa file has been created for XXX.java. It is never removed from that collection, thus it is a zombie object. You have to clean the project to get the errors in the orm.xml file.
