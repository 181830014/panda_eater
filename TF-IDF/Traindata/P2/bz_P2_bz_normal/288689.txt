Currently, SynchronizeRepositoriesJob just asks for

bc. connector.isRepositoryConfigurationStale(repository, monitor)

to determine wether to update the configuration. Also, the last updated timestamp is set afterwards, so on failure there will be no record.

Necessary changes:
* record a "last attempt" instead (or besides) a "last updated" time stamp
* exponentially increase the period between updating stale configuration 
* find a reasonable limit ( 1 day, 1 week?) for maximum time interval between stale configuration updates
