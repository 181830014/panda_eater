I am encountering a number of issues when trying to read in an entity mappings file containing a <structure>.

1) The 'target-class' is never initialized;  I don't see an element defined in the XSD for target class, so I assume it's never read in.

2) A validation exception is thrown if I don't set 'attribute-type' when VIRTUAL access is used.  The 'target-class' is being set;  is setting 'attribute-type' really necessary?

FYI, my structure looks like:

<orm:structure name="addr_region" target-class="test.Dbws_region />
