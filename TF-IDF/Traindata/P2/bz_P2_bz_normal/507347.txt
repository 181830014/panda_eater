If you have an Ecore where you have a package and directly inside it a subpackage without an EClassifier next to the subpackage, then the view model for Classes of this subpackage is not loaded.
The problem is, that EMF doesn't generate any package description for the parent package. But the ViewModel expects this parent package to exists. This way the uri of the rootEClass cannot be resolved and the ECLass of the ViewModel doesn't fit the provided EClass when retrieving the view.

We need to handle this case in the EcoreHelper class.
