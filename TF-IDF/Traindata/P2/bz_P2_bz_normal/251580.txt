The quick fix to Bug 247735 was to turn off validation when reading persistence xml.  There are better more correct solutions listed in that bug that should be explored.

-----
An error can occur reading Persistence XML when the enviroment is configured to
use a JAXP SAX parser that does not support the
"http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaLanguage" property, the
following exception occurs:

Caused by: org.xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException:
http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaLanguage
    at org.apache.xerces.framework.XMLParser.setProperty(XMLParser.java:1626)
    at org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser.setProperty(SAXParser.java:770)
    at org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserImpl.setProperty(SAXParserImpl.java:183)
    at
PersistenceUnitProcessor.processPersistenceXML(PersistenceUnitProcessor.java:121)

Currently for reading Persistence XML schema validation is enabled using JDK
1.4 style APIs, a fix could involve the following options:

1.  Continue to use JDK 1.4 APIs, but enable user to turn validation off.
2.  Continue to use JDK 1.4 APIs, but log a message when schema validation
cannot be enabled.
3.  Switch to use JDK 1.5 APIs, this has been the approach in other areas of
EclipseLink.
