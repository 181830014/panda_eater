More information:
The right side of the error pop-up (support info button, "what were you doing?" entry area, etc) is cut off by the right side of the pop-up window.  Dragging horizontally scales the stack trace window and the right side proportionally, so on a wide enough screen you can see the entire pop-up.  The problem appears to be that "desired width" includes the widest line of the stack exception trace, even though that window has its own scroll bar.
