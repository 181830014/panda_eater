deploy failure with schema-generation to create ddl without file name
http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-19862
glassfish-4.0-b79.zip

In the test of web app with
<property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="create"/>
<property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action" value="drop-and-create"/>
I got deploy failure with schema-generation to create ddl without file name

Email discussions with Guy and Mitesh.
1) JPA2.1 Spec. "Scripts will only be generated if script targets are specified."
In one view, this is defined by the spec.
In another view,  can deployment go through with warning message?

2)  The old way  will still work,
<property name="eclipselink.ddl-generation" value="drop-and-create-tables"/>
<property name="eclipselink.ddl-generation.output-mode" value="both"/>
It is user friendly since ddl can be created with default name.
