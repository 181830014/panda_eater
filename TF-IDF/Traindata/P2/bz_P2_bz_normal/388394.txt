You can't use "standard" validation (jsr303) when composite persistence units are used.

the reason is this code in EntityManagerSetupImpl:

[code]
if (!isCompositeMember()) {
    addBeanValidationListeners(deployProperties, realClassLoader);
}
[/code]


in lines 431-433

which basically means: if the pu in question is composite member then now validation listeners is added.

On the other hand the "master" no validation listener is added too: one can see that several lines above.

I had a look at the source code versions 2.3.3 and 2.4.0 and the problem seems to remain there as well.
