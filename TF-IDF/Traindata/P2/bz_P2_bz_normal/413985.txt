In one of my entity classes, I basically have a field of type Set<EmbeddableClass>, similar to the example in JavaDoc of javax.persistence.CollectionTable:

@Embeddable public class Address {
   protected String street;
   ... 
 }

@Entity public class WealthyPerson extends Person {
   @ElementCollection
   @CollectionTable(name="HOMES") // use default join column name
   @AttributeOverrides({
      @AttributeOverride(name="street", 
                         column=@Column(name="HOME_STREET"))
    })
   protected Set<Address> vacationHomes = new HashSet();
   ...
}

I would expect that collection table HOMES would contain column HOME_STREET but not STREET. However, in my case, that table actually has the latter (STREET). Thus, it seems that annotation @AttributeOverrides has no effect.

I am using EclipseLink 2.5.0 and MariaDB 5.5.31 with MySQL Connector/J 5.1.21.
