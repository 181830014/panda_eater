I often use the quick filter dialog in my Task List to find specific bugs (tasks).  Once I find the bug I often want to see the sub-items, however, they are filtered (they didn't match the filter criteria).  So I clear my filter, but then my task list collapses and the item I selected is no longer selected.  

This means that the filter is useless if I want to see sub-items, but with a few hundred tasks it's difficult to find things without this control.
