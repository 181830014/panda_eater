We have started to use the JDT @Nullable and @NonNull annotations in some of the code but null analysis is not enabled so there are no warnings if the annotations are not respected. We should enable null analysis but we need to use settings that don't result in a huge number of warnings because most of the code is not annotated. We need to choose the right defaults.
