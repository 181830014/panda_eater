Currently, the Web services Ant task has it's own data mapping stored in AntClientRootCommandFragment and AntServiceRootCommandFragment which basically is a subset of ClientWidgetBinding and ServerWidgetBinding respectively.  So whenever we add or delete a binding from the widget binding, we need to make the same change to the Ant root command fragment.  This is very error prone and high maintence. We should restructure the registerDataMapping in the widget binding to call 2 methods. One of them is the mapping that's applicable for both Ant and wizard and the other one is the mapping just for the wizard.  With this restructuring, updates to the mapping only needs to be done in one place.
