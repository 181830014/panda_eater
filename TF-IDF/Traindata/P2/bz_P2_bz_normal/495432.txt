When I enable Mylyn in project/package explorer to show contents filtered for my current task context... then it seems the "Customize View" action gets disabled.

Similarly the "Filters..." action which has a similar function in the package explorer gets disabled as well.

I'm not sure this behavior is intentional, but it is definitely annoying. I'm also pretty sure that this behavior is new in Eclipse 4.6. In Eclipse 4.5 these actions did not get disabled by Mylyn I think.

If its intentional then its still strange because I still can get around this by disabling task-focused mode, then changing the filters on the view and then switching back to task-focused view again.

Also... in package explorer... there will be 'shortcut' menus for the Filters that have been used before and these do not get disabled (which is inconsistent with the fact that the generic "Filters..." menu does get disabled.

Oh and I just spotted another 'action' that mylyn seems to disable. The action to toggle "Link with editor".

Attaching a screenshot of the view menu in package explorer view. Notice that:

 - Focus on Active Task is enabled
 - "Filters..." is disabled
 - "Closed projects" action is enabled (which is inconsistent if disabling "Filters" was actually intentional)
 - "Link with Editor" is checked but disabled (so even though the action is checked and linking is 'active', I can not use the action to toggle it off/on)
