I have shared-cache-mode = ALL in the persistence.xml and a multitenant entity with @Cacheable(false) specified on it, I get this warning:
[EL Config]: Ignoring the explicit cacheable=false set for the entity class [class model.Employee] since a caching type of ALL has been specified in the persistence.xml file.
