Build Identifier: 2.1.1

See bug 297198:

The solution breaks with HSQLDB 2.x. Version 1.8.x requires a comma between
"START BY 1" and "INCREMENT BY 1", while version 2.x complies with SQL:2008 and
does not accept the comma.

The previous fix added the unnecessary "INCREMENT BY 1" (increment is 1 by
default). If this is removed, it will work with all versions of 1.8.x and 2.x.

The method should be altered as follows:

public void printFieldIdentityClause(Writer writer) throws ValidationException
{
  try {
    writer.write(" GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1)");
  } catch (IOException ex) {
    throw ValidationException.fileError(ex);
  }
}

Reproducible: Always
