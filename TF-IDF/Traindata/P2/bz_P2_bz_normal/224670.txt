The JIRA issue appears as scheduled for today even though it's closed.  The task is locally synchronized (with no incomming changes).
I don't want to filter completed tasks, since then I won't see incomming changes for other completed tasks.
the only way I can see to work around this problem is to remove the due date, which requires that I go to the web interface
Note that this problem is related to the JIRA 'due date' field, not the Mylyn 'scheduled date'.
