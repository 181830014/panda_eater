[I'm not sure if this is the correct place to report this; please move the report to Orbit or wherever it belongs if this isn't a BIRT bug]

org.apache.batik.pdf contains classes from other Apache projects:

Avalon: org/apache/avalon/framework/
commons-io: org/apache/commons/io/
commons-logging: org/apache/commons/logging/

Some of these classes are incomplete. For example, IOUtils just contains a small fraction of all available commons-io classes. My own project uses IOUtils and now I get build errors if I include BIRT via the POJO runtime.

I can't solve this short of deleting those classes because I have no control over the order in my classpath when the app runs in a web container.

Please don't merge several OSS projects into one. Use the proper Orbit bundles instead.
