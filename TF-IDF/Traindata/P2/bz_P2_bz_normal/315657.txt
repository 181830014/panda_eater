In bug 315242 we fixed an issue with fetch groups and weaving by ignoring variables called _persistence_fetchGroup in our metadata processing code.

This fix needs to be revisited.

Some suggestions to solve the problem:

1. Add an EclipseLink specific annotation to get EclipseLink to ignore the field
2. Add a property that affects whether weaved fetch groups are serializable and default it to false
