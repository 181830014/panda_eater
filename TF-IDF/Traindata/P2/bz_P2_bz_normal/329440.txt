We have some support for duplicate items in DirectCollectionMapping.  It seems to write correctly to the database, but either the merge or read is failing to include the duplicate.

Can recreate using the advanced JPA model, add same item twice to responsiblities, run verifyObject after update, and will fail as duplicate is not maintained.
