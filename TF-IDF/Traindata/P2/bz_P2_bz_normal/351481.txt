Have verified this behavior on both EclipseLink 2.0.0 and Eclipse 2.3.0.

I have the following name query defined on an Entity:

**********
@NamedQuery(name = "Definition.findDefault",
                    query = "SELECT DISTINCT d"
                            + " FROM Category c JOIN c.definitions d"
                            + " WHERE c.active=true AND d.active=true AND d.defaultInCategory=true",
                    hints = {@QueryHint(name = QueryHints.CACHE_USAGE, value = CacheUsage.CheckCacheThenDatabase)})
**********

Note the use of a JOIN, and that the (single) result returned by the SELECT is from the right side of that JOIN.
With the QueryHint in play, EclipseLink incorrectly returns 'c' (the Category).
Without the QueryHint, EclipseLink correctly returns 'd' (the Definition).
