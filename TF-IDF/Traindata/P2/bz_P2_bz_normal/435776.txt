Using "Compare with base" doesn't handle the author field (addedBy()). Some works was done in Bug 391615.  The result is the internal structure doesn't have an IReview object or something similar. There is some side effect when a user enter a comment and when hovering the person icon, no user was entered (  Bug 435438 ). It also cause effect to Bug 423242 (ability to edit comment from compare navigator). Another side effect, the author of a comment icon is null and the Person icon display the wrong color when opening a navigator with "compare with base".
