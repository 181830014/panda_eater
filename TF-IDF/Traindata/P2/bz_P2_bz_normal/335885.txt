but here's my problem: ig have these three classes:

Cliente: http://pastie.org/1501994 (yes, cliente has id, but is not shown)
GrupoTelefone: http://pastie.org/1501995
Telefone: http://pastie.org/1501996

when i try to save a NEW 'cliente', eclipselink says that the fields to insert on grupotelefone table is null..so, looking at the grupotelefone table, it has only an Id, which is referenced in other tables...but, being a new grupotelefone, he hasn't id (the database generates a new one) and this way, all the fields (only id, in this case) is null...

anyway, refer to: http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&th=203773&start=0&S=84a0b649e689e5e3abd5bbcc0ea5b6ed
