Build Identifier: 2.3.0.v20110604-r9504

During some transition scenario that I cannot reproduce, I found that EclipseLink creates the default discriminator column "DTYPE" as nullable.

I cannot imagine that there is a case where an entity would be persisted that contains null in this value.

In my case, it prevented discovery of the scenario in which one such entity with null in "DTYPE" was created - it was creating problems later.

The attached testcase is a NetBeans project that needs some configuration of its libraries.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Extract the attached testcase and open in NetBeans
2. Configure persistence.xml
3. Configure libraries
4. Run JUnit test - should create table
5. Inspect table layout - column "DTYPE" should NOT be nullable
