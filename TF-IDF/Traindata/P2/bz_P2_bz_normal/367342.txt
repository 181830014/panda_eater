Default mapping does not default any JPA 2.0 mapping types.
These should be defaulted correctly the same as JPA 1.0 mapping types.

- List/Set<EmbeddableType> - should default to ElementCollection (current defaults to Basic)
- List/Set<BasicType> - should default to ElementCollection (current defaults to Basic)
- Map<BasicType, EmbeddableType> - ElementCollection with MapKeyColumn (current defaults to Basic)
- Map<EmbeddableType, EmbeddableType> - ElementCollection with MapKeyClass (current defaults to Basic)
- Map<EntityType, EmbeddableType> - ElementCollection with MapKeyJoinColumn (current defaults to Basic)
- Map<BasicType, BasicType> - ElementCollection with MapKeyColumn (current defaults to Basic)
- Map<EmbeddableType, BasicType> - ElementCollection with MapKeyClass (current defaults to Basic)
- Map<EntityType, BasicType> - ElementCollection with MapKeyJoinColumn (current defaults to Basic)
- Map<BasicType, EntityType> - OneToMany with MapKeyColumn (current defaults to OneToMany with Id as MapKey, which will may fail... but might work)
- Map<EmbeddableType, EntityType> - OneToMany with MapKeyClass (current defaults to OneToMany with Id as MapKey, which will fail)
- Map<EntityType, EntityType> - OneToMany with MapKeyJoinColumn (current defaults to OneToMany with Id as MapKey, which will fail)
