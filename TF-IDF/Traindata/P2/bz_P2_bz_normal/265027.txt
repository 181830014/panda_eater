When Eclipse restarts after an unclean shutdown, it often hangs while loading my workspace.

The hang seems to be connected to RSE: I can load up my workspace again by temporarily removing the RSE metadata (<workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.rse.*). Then, after one successful startup, I can stop Eclipse, copy my original RSE metadata back, start Eclipse again and continue working as usual.

Here is a Java dump taken during the hang on startup:

Here are my Eclipse configuration details:

The details above are from Eclipse 3.4.1 + TM 3.0.2, but I have experienced the same issue on Eclipse 3.5M5 + TM 3.1M5.
