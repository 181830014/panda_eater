The StructureAccessor metadataclass appears to support a targetClass being defined on a structure mapping. The targetClass is mapped in XMLEntityMappingsMappingProject. But in the eclipselink-orm schema there is no target-class attribute defined. The Structure annotation does not define a target-class either.
