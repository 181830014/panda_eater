When creating a new WebDynamic project, the wizard doesn't seem to validate the Name field correctly after each character is typed in.

So in the case when you enter the a project name of an existing project, the wizard will give an error, but even after correcting the name the wizard still displays the error.

Steps
1. Create a project "testing"
2. Create a second project "testing2"

All buttons expect back are disabled. Pressing back and then next, fixing the error, but this shouldn't happen.
