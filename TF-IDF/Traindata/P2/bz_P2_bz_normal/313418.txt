On a delete all query we delete m-m join tables and direct collections, but are not deleting 1-1 with join tables, or aggregate collections.  They should be deleted as well.

In the delete all code it is currently checking for an casting to ManyToManyMapping and DirectCollectionMapping, instead it should dispatch to the mapping.
