With multiple generic types, the table-relations are all created with the last argument type. 
With the classes below, the table of FooImpl has two foreign key relations to BImpl:
aReference_idB
bReference_idB

I would expect the relationship aReference to be with AImpl instead. The tables I expect are:
aReference_idA
bReference_idB

@MappedSuperclass
abstract class AbstractFoo<A extends AType, B extends BType>{
   A aReference;
   B bReference;
   @Id
   long id;
}

@Entity
class FooImpl extends AbstractFoo<AImpl, BImpl>{
}

@MappedSuperclass
abstract class AType{
   @Id
   long idA;
}

@MappedSuperclass
abstract class BType{
   @Id
   long idB;   
}
