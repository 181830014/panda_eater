Currently, the Gerrit connector obtains config information through parsing the html content. This is not a stable API and is subject to change at any time. For example in Gerrit 2.11, one such change prevented users from opening tasks and editing queries. Gerrit will be providing a /config/ REST endpoint in Gerrit 2.12 that will return the necessary data.
