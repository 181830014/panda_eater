If you have the following mapping:
    
    @ElementCollection
    @CollectionTable(name = "JPARS_CERTIFICATION", joinColumns = {@JoinColumn(name="EMP_ID")})
    private List<Certification> certifications = new ArrayList<Certification>();

That maps the following object

@Embeddable
public class Certification {
    @Column(name = "NAME")
    private String name;
    
    @Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)
    @Column(name = "ISSUE_DATE")
    private Calendar issueDate;

...

The DDL for the issueDate will create a column of type VARCHAR instead of a temporal type. (If a similar Temporal mapping is mapped directly on an Entity everything works)   This incorrect DDL eventually results in exceptions when reading objects with these mappings.
