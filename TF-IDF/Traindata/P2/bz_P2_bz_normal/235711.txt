1. File > Open File..., choose an SML-IF file
2. Click on "validate" or "import" links on first page of editor

You see an hourglass for a few seconds, and nothing happens.  This works fine if the SML-IF file is already a workspace file.

I suspect this is a case where we aren't handling a URI file since that is what Eclipse gives the editor.  So we need to tease out the actual file name from that object just like we do in the init() method of the editor.
