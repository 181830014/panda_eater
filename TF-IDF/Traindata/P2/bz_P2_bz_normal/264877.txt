DescriptionDirectEditPolicy is a subclass of LabelDirectEditPolicy and it contains necessary functionality for editing pure-design diagram elements. In the same time:
1. This class is in internal package
2. Whole functionality of this class can be moved to it's superclass (LabelDirectEditPolicy) by adding appropriate parameter (like: "hasDomainElement"). 

The problem is: intention of DescriptionDirectEditPolicy AFAIKSee was just to replace EObjectAdapter creation logic from its parent. I think it does not make sense to create separate class for it (in addition just duplicating the logic from LabelDirectEditPolicy in this overriden method).

Currently generated code uses LabelDirectEditPolicy and does not work correctly for the pure-design diagram elements (diagram elements without undarlying domain model). The workaround for now is to switch off assertion, but i suppose this inconsistency in GMF runtime classes should be fixed in general.
