This bug can be reproduced with EclipseLink-2.3.0.

If an Embeddable derives from an Embeddable which has an Embedded property, this Embedded property will not be mapped. It will be mapped when the superclass Embeddable is used, thus this is a problem in the implementation of bug 283028.

Suppose the following constellation:

An Embeddable "Primitive" defines a field "field".

An Embeddable "BasicEmbeddable" has a property of type "Primitive", which is annotated with Embedded.

An Embeddable "ExtendedEmbeddable" inherits from "BasicEmbeddable".

An Entity "TheEntity" contains "ExtendedEmbeddable".

The resulting table will NOT contain the field "field".

To simplify this a bit:

TheEntity refers to ExtendedEmbeddable inherits from BasicEmbeddable refers to Primitive

I will attach a test case with which the problem can be reproduced.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Extract test case and create a corresponding persistence.xml
2. Generate tables or do whatever is necessary to inspect the mappings
3. Notice that theentity only has a field "test", and is missing the field "field"
