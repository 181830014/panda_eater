Attempting to set a FetchGroup on a query when weaving has not been performed results in the exception:

Exception Description: You must define a fetch group manager at descriptor <CLASSNAME> in order to set a fetch group on the query (null)

If the only reason for there to be no fetch group manager is because weaving was not performed then the exception should indicate that configuring weaving may resolve this issue. If there are other possible root causes then those should be described also so that the developer can avoid this exception.
