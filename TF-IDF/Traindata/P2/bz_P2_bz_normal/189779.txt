Dali fails to detect when a single column is mapped to multiple attributes.  This results in a runtime error and failure when a project is deployed to a JPA runtime like TopLink Essentials.  It is illegal to map multiple attributes to the same column.

This is a common mapping mistake and will be hit fairly frequently by new JPA developers.  The goal of Dali is to reduce and hopefully eliminate design time mapping errors that would result in deployment failure.  Not identifying this problem will result in frequent deployment failures.
