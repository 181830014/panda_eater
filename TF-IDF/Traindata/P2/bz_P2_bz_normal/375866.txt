CPP package contents as per About in Juno M6.

Build ID: Juno M6

Looking at http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/junom6
the package contents is outdated:

- Linuxtools stuff all missing
- Marketplace client not explicitly highlighted
  ("epp.common.feature" is misleading)

The correct contents as per "help > About" in CPP Juno M6 is in attached GIF.
