MetaclassInstance classes are currently owned by 'org.eclipse.gmt.modisco.infra.common.core'. This plug-in has dependencies to various products (EMF, JDT, PDE).

MetaclassInstance classes implements the "allInstanceOf" feature. This feature only depends of EMF. Further more this feature is note strictly in the MoDisco scope and this feature can be useful for project which do not need MoDisco.

That's why those classes have to be owned by an EMF dedicated plug-in called 'org.eclipse.modisco.util.emf.core'.
