Steps to reproduce:
1. Start debug session with some local JS file
2. Change the file such that the breakpoints lines will change (e.g. press Enter in the first line)
3. Note that error dialog shows up and tells that Hot code replace feature is not supported
4. Press Terminate
5. Start debug session again

Now debugger does not stop on breakpoints any more
