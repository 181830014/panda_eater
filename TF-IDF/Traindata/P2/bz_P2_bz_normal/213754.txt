There are occasional failures in taglib index unit tests. 

For exmaple, occasionally, such as 1 of 4 builds, this test will fail:

The test should either be fixed, or removed from the build tests (since an unreliable test is not a good test to have run each build ... yes, it indicates a problem, but, if it doesn't indicate a regression we should fix immediately and re-spin for, then it's not doing us much good as a JUnit test.
