In trying to deploy a persistence unit an getting no errors logged, but having things not work.  I turned on logging and got these errors logged at config and finest, they should be warning (or perhaps even fail for the osgi one?),

 [java] [EL Config]: ServerSession(33078541)--Thread(Thread[Start Level Event Dispatcher,5,main])--Exception while loading ORM xml file: META-INF/non-existant-orm-file.xml: Exception [EclipseLink-7253]
 [java] Exception Description: There is no mapping file called [META-INF/non-existant-orm-file.xml] in classpath for persistence unit named [default].

 [java] [EL Finest]: Thread(Thread[Start Level Event Dispatcher,5,main])--Construction of environment specific OSGi initializer, [org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.deployment.osgi.equinox.EquinoxInitializer] failed with message: [java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException].
