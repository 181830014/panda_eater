It is impossible to telnet to vxWorks 5.5 target. 

I checked the TCP dump and this is what I noticed:

After successful connection to vxWorks (with password) the RSE Telnet changes its source port number and wants to continue TCP tranmsition with new source port. But since VxWorks telnet is a single user server it reports Sorry system is engaged and the TCP stream stops.

Is there any reason for changing the source port number?
