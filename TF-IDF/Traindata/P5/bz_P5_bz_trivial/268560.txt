Rename message that states that we are "reconnecting" to external connection pool to one that states we are only "requesting" an existing pooled connection.


Reproduction:
-------------
Run against an external connection pool via a global scoped (or application scoped) JTA datasource that persists 2 or more entities on the WebLogic server.
Any container managed app will do - for example:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Examples/JPA/WebLogic_Web_Tutorial

You will see the following message that seems to be implying that we are reconnecting to the pool.  In fact we are requesting a pooled connection back after having released it previously back to the pool.
This is normal behaviour for DatasourceAccessor.reconnect() so we may want to reword the FINEST message to state
