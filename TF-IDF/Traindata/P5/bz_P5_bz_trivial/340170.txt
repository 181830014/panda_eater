With a model discoverer (subclass of AbstractModelDiscoverer), when the user sets SERIALIZE_TARGET to true but doesn't specify a URI in TARGET_URI, a default target is chosen by the discoverer.

But if the target file chosen by the discoverer already exists, it will be overwritten without the user's knowledge.
