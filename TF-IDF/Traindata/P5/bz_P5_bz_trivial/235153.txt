This is a problem found in RSE-SDK-N20080423-0100.zip.

1. Start the new connection wizard to create a UNIX connection with the host name TEST
2. Press the Next button and go to the Files wizard page
3. Change the server launch type to REXEC and make a couple of changes to the launcher properties
4. Press the cancel button to terminate the connection creation
5. Start the new connection wizard to create a Linux connection with the host name TEST
6. Press the Next button and go to the Files wizard page
7. The same properties page set in step 3 appeared
8. Press the OK button without making further change
9. Open the launcher properties of the Linux connection, the launcher was actually set to Daemon and nothing set in step 3 was picked up.
There are two problems/questions here.
1. Since the connection type was changed from UNIX to Linux although the host name was the same, should the launcher properties setting be carried over?
2. The launcher properties shown in step 8, whatever it was, should be used to create the connection.

The same problem can be reproduced with the following changes to the steps.
4. Press the OK button to create the connection
5. Start the new connection wizard to create another Linux connection with the host name TEST
