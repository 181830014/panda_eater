With 2 classes a.C1 and b.C1, the following line:

a.C1 a = new b.C1();

yields this error message:

Type mismatch: cannot convert from C1 to C1.

While in this case it is pretty obvious what the problem is, but we came across
this problem when using a external API (Type mismatch: cannont convert from
Iterator to Iterator).

A simple fix would be to test for the case when the shortened name of both
classes are the same and instead give the full package name.  For example:

Type mismatch: cannot convert from b.C1 to a.C1.
