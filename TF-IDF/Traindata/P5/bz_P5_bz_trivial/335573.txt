Extension points in:
/org.eclipse.emf.facet.util.emf.core/schema
are not defined correctly.

For example, for extension catalogmanager:
- the id should be "catalogmanager" instead of "org.eclipse.emf.facet.util.emf.core.catalogmanager"
- same thing for the id referenced in the "extension-point" element in the plugin.xml
- the file should be named "catalogmanager.exsd" instead of "org.eclipse.emf.facet.util.emf.core.catalogmanager.exsd"

The documentation is here:
http://help.eclipse.org/helios/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/extension-points/index.html

It states:
"Edit the Plug-in ID field to specify the qualifier portion of the unique extension point schema ID. This field's value should match the the ID of the plug-in that the schema's corresponding extension point is defined in. "
and " The format of an extension point schema ID is the same as the fully qualified ID of it's corresponding extension point: <plugin-id>.<point-id> "
