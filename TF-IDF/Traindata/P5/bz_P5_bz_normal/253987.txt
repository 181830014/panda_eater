When a Connection Pool is defined within a sessions.xml file but no login information is provided EclipseLink will use the session login.  Because of the way the Connection Pool config is processed EclipseLink will ignore any external connection pool settings on the session login and use internal TopLink pools for the defined Connection Pools.
