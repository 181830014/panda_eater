I wrote an action to edit the description of the table. I use tableInstance.setDescription(newDescription) to change the description. 
I see 2 problems : 
	- the widget is not refreshed to change the displayed description
	- the editor doesn't see that I changed the description -> when I save my file, the new description is not saved.
