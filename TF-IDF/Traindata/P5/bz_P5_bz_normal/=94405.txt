3.1M7 test build, observed on the various motifs, is most apparent on slower
boxes

- begin retrieving a large project from dev.eclipse.org and run the retrieval in
the background
- watch the "Retrieving..." status string in the very bottom-right corner of the
workbench -> it often flashes, even when its content (ie.- the percentage
retrieved) has not changed
- to eliminate this flashing, this Canvas should either use the DOUBLE_BUFFERED
support, or (more efficient but slightly less effective) don't redraw the Canvas
if its text content is not changing
