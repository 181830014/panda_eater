In fixing bug 6151822 we found a corner case that is currently not supported.
It's probably not that common so is a lower priority to fix.  If I have the following in a schema
<xsd:element ref =”ns0:Address”/>
<xsd:element ref =”ns0:Address”/>

we create an SDOproperty for Address that is many=true.  Now if there was
also other global elements defined of type ns0:Address then the Address
descriptor could have multiple root elements and when marshalling the wrong
element name could be written out.
