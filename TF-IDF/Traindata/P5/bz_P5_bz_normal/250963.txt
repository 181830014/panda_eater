org.eclipse.persistence.platform.xml.XMLComparer

During some testing, two DOM documents were created using
different implementations - the control document from the
internal (xerces) JAXP DocumentBuilder and the SOAP message
from the JAX-WS Soap MessageFactory.

In one case, attributes that are namespace declarations do
not count as attributes while in the other they did, so
'identical' documents failed their comparison using
XMLComparer due to a difference in the number of
attributes for a certain element.

An option 'relaxAttributeXMLNSComparison' would solve
this problem
