Enter the following into a new .f90 file in a project with analysis and refactoring enabled.

program example
    use m
    call s
end program

module m
contains
  subroutine s
  end subroutine
end module

Save the file, then try to use Open Declaration on s in the CALL statement.  It will not work.  Modify the file and save it again; it will.

The VPG is attempting to process the file in-order, so on the first save, it will not have information about the module stored until after it has already processed the main program.  When the file is modified and re-saved, there is information about the module in the database from the previous save, so it works (although the saved information may be out of date by that point).
