I think there is an inconsistency between the Table and the ModelExplorer used in Papyrus. In the ModelExplorer, we use the CustomizationManager, whereas in the NattableWidget, this object is not used, the widget manages itself the CustomizationEngine.
So, in the table we can use customizations declared on EObject (often used to hide the eAnnotation columns), but in the ModelExplorer (we use org.eclipse.emf.facet.infra.browser.uicore.CustomizableModelLabelProvider), we can't use Customization for color, italic, ... declared on EObject (the same problem with the facet).
