The bookmarks view inherits to show busy feedback for the build job families 
from the MarkerView. Since bookmarks are not an output of the build process 
they should not show a corresponding busy indicator.

This is the inherited code from MarkerView causing the problem:

		getProgressService().showBusyForFamily
(ResourcesPlugin.FAMILY_MANUAL_BUILD);
		getProgressService().showBusyForFamily
(ResourcesPlugin.FAMILY_AUTO_BUILD);
