When I open a uml model with the MoDisco browser, accessibility, uicustom and facets buttons appears on the main toolbar.
if i open a uicustom model, they disappear but if i switch to my uml model tab, they reappear. That's how it works in Eclipse 3.8.

When i use Eclipse 4.2, buttons appears when i open my model with the MoDisco Browser, they disappear when i open a uicustom model but they don't reappear when i switch on the uml model tab.
