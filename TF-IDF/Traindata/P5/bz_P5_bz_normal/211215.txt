The SessionFactory currently provides detach functionality through the use a non-synchronized UnitOfWork. This native API approach to detachment should be optimized and aligned with how a JPA entity manager detaches non-transactional entities.

Need to ensure that any read-only configuration options on the Project/Descriptor/UnitOfWork does not prevent proper detachment.
