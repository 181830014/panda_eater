The keys preference page is not yet API (see bug 73510) but when it is there are
problems using it with RCP applications. There are two ways for an RCP
application to define key bindings for commands:

1. define then in the default key configuration, with the caveat that there are
many keys already assigned by org.eclipse.ui
2. define a new key configuration and assign all key bindings for your
application to the new configuration.

The problem will be that although the keys are assigned to a configuration,
essentially scoping them, the keys preference page shows ALL commands as
possibly key bindable. This is because the workbench has no concept of command
namespaces, or command configurations. It becomes confusing because all RCP
applications inherit org.eclipse.ui commands and dialog or pages that simply
display all commands are useless in a RCP applications because the listed
commands may not make sense in that application.
