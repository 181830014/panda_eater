Tested using BIRT build 2.3.0.v20080527:
Create an empty table. Click on a table header cell and right click to bring up the context menu. Under "Insert" submenu, "table" and "list" options are disabled. As a result I cannot insert a table into the table header.

If I click on a table footer cell however, I am able to insert another table.

See attached screenshot
