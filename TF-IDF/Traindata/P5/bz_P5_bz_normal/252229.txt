When running the MOXy test cases against version 6 of the IBM Virtual Machine, several negative tests are failing. This is happening because IBMs Transformer implementation fails in a different way than other implementations and the test cases are expecting a specific error. Also by default, the IBM Transformer Implementation has an ErrorListener set on it that logs error messages to System.err but doesn't rethrow the exception as the test cases expect.
