Here is a typical comment from a user exposed for the first time to eclipse:
  In Windows I know that if I double click on an object that
  the first action from the action menu is invoked.  However,
  in Eclipse I am not sure what the algorithm is and I find I
  just have to try it and see what happens and it appears that
  the invoked action is hard-coded somewhere on a per-object
  basis, which is pretty undeterministic as compared to
  Windows...

Some examples:
- Task View: The first context menu entry is "Add Task", double click
  opens the task (something not on the context menu)
- PDE log view: first entry is "Copy", double click opens
- ...

It would be nice, if the double click action would always be the first in
the context menu or if it would be emphasized in some way....

Maybe the UI-Guidelines should say something about double-clicking...
