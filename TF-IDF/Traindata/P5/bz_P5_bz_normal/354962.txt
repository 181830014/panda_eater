Menu items "Execute Query ... ", "Create Java Query Implementation Class" and "Create Query" appear in every menu in Eclipse 4.2.
They shouldn't. This is a regression compared to MoDisco on Eclipse 3.x

This may be a bug in the compatibility layer, or a different behavior from Eclipse 4.x with the modeled workbench (the aforementioned actions are defined on EObjects).

These actions are defined using "org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus".
