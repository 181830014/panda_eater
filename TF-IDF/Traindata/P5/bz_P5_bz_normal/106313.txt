Create an instance of ApplicationWindow with a status line. In the window's 
contents, create a TableViewer with a vertical ScrollBar. Attach a listener to 
the ScrollBar which will perfom some runnable task using the 
ApplicationWindow's run method with fork set to true.

Run the snippet, click on the table's scroll bar just below the thumb. The 
table scrolls and the ApplicationWindow handles the IRunnableWithProgress 
task. However, the scroll bar still appears highlighted until the mouse is 
moved. Further, if the thumb is clicked and dragged straight after this the 
painting of the scroll bar is done incorrectly and destroys the table.

Another issue is when clicking on the down button of the scroll bar without 
moving the mouse, the entire table will be scrolled. Similar behaviour may be 
observed when clicking on the scroll bar in a position that is relatively 
distant from the thumb.

Without a status line this situation does not occur.
