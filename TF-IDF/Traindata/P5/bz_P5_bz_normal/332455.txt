The project which generates the error

When executing the JSP discoverer on a very simple project containing four JSP pages, I have an error on one of the pages:

Metamodel is still going to be created, but discovering this file : C:/Documents and Settings/fmadiot/workspace/JSP tests/test1.jsp encountered an eror (org.eclipse.modisco.jee.jsp.discoverer_0.9.0.v201011101707)
