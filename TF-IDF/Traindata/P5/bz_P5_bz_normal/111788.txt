A quick look at the latest development version of AspectJ reveals a lot of 
files (.java, .aj, .html, ...) in aspectjtools.jar and asepctjweaver.jar which 
is built from it. This hints at a build process problem that may result in 
shipping what we shouldn't! It's also confusing for users and consumers like 
AJDT because there _are_ non-Java files like the messages properties that are 
required.
