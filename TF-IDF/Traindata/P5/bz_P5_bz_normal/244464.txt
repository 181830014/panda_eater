In addition to the singular @Customizer, there needs to be support for multiple customizers on an Entity through an @Customizers annotation.

e.g.,

@Entity
@Customizers({PostBuildCustomizer.class, AuditingCustomizer.class));
public class Publisher implements Serializable {

The EclipseLink mapping file already supports multiple customizers and there is no need for any changes:

...
  <xsd:complexType name="entity">
...
    <xsd:sequence>
...
      <xsd:element name="customizer" type="orm:customizer" minOccurs="0"/>
...


The order the Customizers are run must be guaranteed to be in the order in which they are declared.
