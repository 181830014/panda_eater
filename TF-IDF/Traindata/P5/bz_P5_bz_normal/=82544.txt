Using the following steps:

1) Have the org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser plugin in your workbench
2) set off a runtime workbench
3) go to "Window > Show View > Other > Visualiser" and select the visualiser 
views
4) click "ok"

produces a SIGSEGV in the JVM (every time).

This only occurs with IBM's 142 JVM and doesn't occur if you set the compiler 
properties of org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser not to inline (right click 
org.eclipse.contribution.visualiser > properties > aspectj compiler > use 
project settings > Advanced > No Inline)

This is because of aspectj bug 80430.
