1. start fresh workspace
2. create Java project "JUnit"
   (accept to switch to Java perspective)
3. import JUnit source into "JUnit"
4. Ctrl+H
5. switch to "Java Search" page
6. check "Search the JRE system libraries"
7. click "All occurrences"
8. click Method
9. enter toString
10. click Search
11. click "Run in Background"
12. observe: Search view title is italic
13. give focus to Problems view and wait
14. observe: Search view title (might) turn bold
15. give focus to Search view
16. context menu > Search Again
17. click "Run in Background"
18. give focus to Problems view and wait
19. observe: Search view title *does not* turn bold (sometimes a quick bold
title might be visible).

I could reproduce this with other scenarios e.g. first search then add some
error to the code and save ==> Problems view did not get bold title.
