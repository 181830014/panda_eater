This test fails when sortedByTypeAtoZList array and sorted columns list are compared (AtoZ and Type). The column '/eReferences' is missplaced.

The test should be modified to compare directly the current column eStructuralFeature type name and the next column eStructuralFeature type name. If the two eStructuralFeature type names are equal, we should compare eStructuralFeature names.

We should ignore the test until modification.
