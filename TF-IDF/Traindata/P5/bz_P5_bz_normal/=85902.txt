When you right click, source, add import in Mac OS X, and the Class you need to import is not unique 
(such as List, Comparator, ArrayList, etc, etc), eclipse pops up the searching box, and behind it pops up 
a box with the results of the search.  Unfortunately, you cannot focus to the window behind it to select 
the correct import.  You cannot actually focus to any window, or even close the app.

After a while (5-15 mins) it allows you to focus to the required window and select your import.  Very 
annoying.
