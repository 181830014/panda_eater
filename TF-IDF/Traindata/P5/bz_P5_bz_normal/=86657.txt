If you are editing Old.java and refactor the name to New.java, the window title
continues to report "Old.java".

This is an issue if you are doing applet development and testing multiple
browsers. The only way to be sure that all browsers reload the current version
is to continually upgrade the name (app0, app1, ...) and update the HTML with
the latest name. As you cycle thru the browsers, the minimized Eclipse is
reporting the wrong version name.
