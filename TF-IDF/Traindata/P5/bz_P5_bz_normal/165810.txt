Hello,

when having an advice for a pointcut expression like:
  !execution(* *.Test.get*())
this leads to a strange exception when running the compiled program:

> java test.Test
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
        at test.Test.<clinit>(Test.java:1)
Caused by: org.aspectj.lang.NoAspectBoundException: test_Aspect
        at test.Aspect.aspectOf(Aspect.aj:1)
        at test.Aspect.<clinit>(Aspect.aj)
        ... 1 more

It took me a while, to figure out, that such a pointcut expression does not make sense. A sensible combination like
  !execution(* *.Test.get*()) && execution(* *.*(..))
worked fine.
A compiler warning (or even an error) would be desirable when encountering advices for such pointcut expressions. The exception gave me no clue to what was causing the problem.

Test case follows.

Regards Ben
