In 3.1 a new constructor was added to Window - Window(IShellProvider
shellProvider). It was also added to Dialog.

Constructors were not added to the public subclass ProgressMonitorDialog so now
our private ProgressMonitorDialogs cannot take advantage of this.

We want to add ProgressMonitorDialog(IShellProvider) to the API. It will call
the API in the super class and otherwise work like ProgressMonitorDialog(Shell).
