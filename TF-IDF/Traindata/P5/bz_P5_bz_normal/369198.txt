Created attachment 209797 [details]

I tried the model table on Eclipse 4.2 M4, and I noticed that the "open saved table" and "create new element" buttons have an invisible icon in the view's toolbar (see attached screenshot)

The corresponding commands are defined like this :

<command commandId="org.eclipse.emf.facet.widgets.table.openSavedTableCommand"
icon="IMG_OBJ_FOLDER" style="push" tooltip="%open.table">

<command commandId="org.eclipse.emf.facet.widgets.table.createNewElementCommand"
icon="IMG_OBJ_ADD" style="pulldown" tooltip="%create.new.element">


The icon definition produces a warning in both Eclipse 3.7.1 and 4.2M4:
 Referenced resource 'IMG_OBJ_FOLDER' in attribute 'icon' cannot be found
But the icons appeared in 3.7.1 and they don't anymore in 4.2M4.
