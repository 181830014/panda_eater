I've tried to search a class references in all workspace (among all projects) to
see where is referenced this class. The results that appears always are relative
to the project where I'm searching references, never show any result of classes
on any other project that uses the referenced class.
I've tried different ways like:
   - Search in working set 
   - Open/close projects and then search
   - Eclipse 3.1 
and the result is the same. In fact, the results of search in working set,
workspace and project are always the same.
