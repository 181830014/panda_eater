I-build 0824:

I opened this build using an older workspace, it came up, I did not see 
anything happening (i.e. progress indication in the lower right corner), and 
tried to open the Help menu. At that point, the Users jobs dialog came up, 
showing that tasks that must complete first, it goes away, and does this a few 
times. I may have accidentally clicked the Help menu a few times, and that 
could explain the flickering of the dialog.
