Steps to reproduce : 
	1/ create a UML Model
	2/ Open a table on the Model with the action "View in a table"
		-> the table contains the object Model
	3/ Export the table as XMI
	4/ Open the file as text and look for the local customs : 
		2 local customs are declared with no name : 
			  <localCustomizations/>
			  <localCustomizations/>

			  
	Now, open a empty table (using the patch provided by the bug 387591), drop the model in the table, export as XMI in an other file and open it as a text file.
		-> the contents of the file is the same, except for the customization. Now we get : 
		  <localCustomizations name="Column hiding customization for ecore"/>
		  <localCustomizations name="Column hiding customization for uml"/>
