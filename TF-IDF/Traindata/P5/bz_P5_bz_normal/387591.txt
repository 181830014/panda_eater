Most of the time, when I must report an bug on the table, firstly I should provide a plugin to open an empty table to reproduce by bug on Ecore Model. I already have the problem with the first version of the table (0.1.X). So I think that EMF-Facet should provide a way to open empty table in order to post and reproduce easily bugs on EMF-Facet table.
