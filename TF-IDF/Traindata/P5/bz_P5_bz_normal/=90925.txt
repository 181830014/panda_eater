When setting up a project, I kept getting an error dialog with unidentified CVS access errors (I don't 
have any CVS connections; the one I had I disconnected in an attempt to make that error dialog stop 
showing, which didn't work).

To avoid having to continually dismiss the error dialog, I iconified it.  Now no input dialog will display 
until the error dialog is un-iconified and dismissed.  Since the error dialog only shows up in the Dock, 
there's no indication within eclipse of what is wrong, only that every operation invoked from menus or 
context menus seems to start and then do nothing.
