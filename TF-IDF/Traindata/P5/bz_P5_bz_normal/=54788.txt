Our plugins have their own set of preference pages. If someone press the apply 
button, some settings are performed and some Java classpath and Platform path 
variables are set/updated.

If someone has opened (instanciated) the Platform's path variable preference 
page before, then modified our page, then pressed apply, and then reselect it, 
its internal model is not updated. It still contains the old path variables.

The Java's classpath variable preference page has excactly the same problem. I 
have to close and reopen the preferences dialog to see the new values.
