Update CacheType annotation and XML to rename the CacheType.NONE option to be a name that more clearly indicated the implications of using this setting or at least provoke a sense that more research into this setting is required.  The current name is confusing for users as it means much more than simply turning off caching.

NO_IDENTITY has been proposed as an option.
