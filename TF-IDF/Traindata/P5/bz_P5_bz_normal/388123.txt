Steps to reproduce : 
	1/ Create an empty table
	2/ Add Facet Column with the action Add Columns
	    -> the added columns are not visible
	3/ Drop elements using these facets
		-> the added columns are not visible too
		-> using Show/Hide columns, these columns are not proposed, so they have never been created.
