For invalid connectors there could also be some improvements to make it more clear to the user that it is an invalid connector, e.g. you are able to start dragging a connector from an external behavior port, i.e. a preview connector appears fooling the user into believing a connector could be created. Compared with the case when you try to connect an SPP or SAP, in which case no pre-view connector is shown at all. This makes more sense and should also be used for the external behavior port case.
