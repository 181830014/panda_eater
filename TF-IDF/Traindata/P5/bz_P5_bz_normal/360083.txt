When trying to edit a string cell in a tabular editor, I have encountred this bug:
Steps to reproduce:
1/ double click on a string cell without doing any modification on the contents of the cell
2/ try to double click once again on the same cell, or another cell on the same column, the cell is locked. No possibility to edit edit.
