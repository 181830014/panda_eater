- in the browser example, open the history view
- drag it into the same folder as the browser view
- drag it to the left edge of the stack until you get the left arrow
- drop it
- it splits the area evenly
- drag it back so there's a single stack again
- drag it to the left edge of the window until you get the right arrow
- drop it
- it splits the area 1/3, 2/3

If dropping on the same edge, there should be only one way of doing it.
