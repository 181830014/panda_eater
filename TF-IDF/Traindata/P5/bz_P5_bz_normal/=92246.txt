When you're running at 1024x768 (ie: most laptops) new workbench windows open
off of the screen bounds.  It would be nice if we could detect this case and
compensate for it by recentering the app so that the entire thing is on screen.
 This is particularly terrible when you're running test suites and the new
workbench windows are obscuring your taskbar/system tray.
