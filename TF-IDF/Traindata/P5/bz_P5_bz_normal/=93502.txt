Test Case:
0. start a workbench that has "org.eclipse.jface.text" in the workspace
1. Ctrl+Shift+T
2. type "CPP"
==> several matches one of them being "CompletionProposalPopup"
3. replace "CPP" with "CP*P"
==> "CompletionProposalPopup" is not shown

Honoring all combinations of '*' and camel case might be too expensive but I
would expect that "CP*P" gives at least as many results as "CPP".
