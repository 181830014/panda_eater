stacktrace

I got a NPE in:
org.eclipse.emf.facet.util.core.Logger

While running a SWTBot UI test (EPackageRegistryTest).

I believed what happened is that the Logger was called when the workbench was closing, and after the plug-in Activator's stop() method was called. So, the Activator singleton was null.
