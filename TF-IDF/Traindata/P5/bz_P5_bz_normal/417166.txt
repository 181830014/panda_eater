This test fails when wantedOrder array and sorted columns list are compared. The column 'ePackage' is missplaced.

The test should be modified to compare directly the current column eStructuralFeature name and the next column eStructuralFeature name. We must found :
 - in first place the columns having a name surounded by square braces;
 - in second place the rest of columns ordered by their eStructuralFeature name.
 
We should ignore the test until modification.
