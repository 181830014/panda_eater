Hello,

I'am facing some issues with Eclipse 3.0.2 in regards to mouse events. Whenever 
I try to click on any perspective of Eclipse the rest of the perspectives (or 
sections) of the screen are becoming in active. In other words, If I 
click "Java browsing" section, my mouse click is not working for the rest of 
the sections. I would have to click another application before enabling the 
other sections of Eclipse. But once I do that, the rest doesn't work....so 
between every move of mouse....I've been forced to click other app before 
clicking Eclipse....Any ideas what the problem is.. I've tried uninstalling (4 
times various versions) shutting the systems...re-installed JDK etc.

Thanks,
