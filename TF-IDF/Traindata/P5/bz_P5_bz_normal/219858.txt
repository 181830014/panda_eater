Bidirectional relationship support is a vestige of EJB CMP, is confusing to developers in POJO persistence, and is not supported by JPA.  It should be removed from EclipseLink, Docs, and the Workbench.  

For those migrating to EclipseLink from TopLink it would be necessary to flag such usage when migrating for manual correction.  Since it is a little used feature, removal should not affect many who are migrating.
