Currenlty, when the label displayed in a cell is too long, a part of the label is hidden. There is 2 problems : 
	- the user can't know that the label is not fully displayed : 
			-> add "..." at the end of the displayed text
	- the user can't see the full text without opening the editor
		-> idea : add a tooltip which displays the full label
