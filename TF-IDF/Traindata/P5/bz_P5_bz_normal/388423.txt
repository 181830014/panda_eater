The EOperation used to create new elements (InstanciationMethod) are displayed in the AddColumn Dialog. I think it is a bug, because these operations are used to create new element
and not to display derived feature of the elements. A solution should be to create a new interface InstanciationMethodQuey extending IJavaQuery2 to filter them easily?
