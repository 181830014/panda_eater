When I open a table editor, I see two toolbar groups:
- One with "create new element", "load a customization", "load an EMF Facet", "select columns to hide", "sort column by type", "sort column by name (from A to Z)", and "sort column by name (from Z to A)"
- And a second group with "only show common columns" and "hide empty columns"

What's more, the first group is linked to the editor context, whereas the second is not: when I click on another view in Eclipse, the first group disappears and the second one stays active.

I think the two actions in the second group should be redefined as commands instead of actions.
