A find() call should return null if a value of null is passed in as the PK. It currently throws an NPE.

Based on the Javadoc of the find() call there is some room for interpreting it that an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown instead, but in the spirit of the find() call my expectation would be that null should be returned.
