>The following legacy original product model class, attribute, function names and test content needs to be modified or removed
...for multiple obvious reasons
>The functionality of the tests by the original developer(s) is fully sound and should be retained however.

See packages models.jpa.delimited, models.jpa.advanced and models.jpa.fieldaccess.advanced
Custom*Converter.java - this class needs to be renamed so perhaps Custom
AdvancedJPAJUnitTest.java:621 - this function needs to be removed
Employee.java - one of the attributes and associated enum needs to be changed
jpa.xml.advanced.EntityMappingsAdvancedJUnitTestCase.java:124
This 
- leaving PolicyHolder unchanged for both InsuranceProject projects AND customsqlstoredprocedures package

>Proposed Change: M = Home, F = Office
Use another binary enum like Location {Home, Office} - and retain the non-standard lowercase chars in the enum constants.

>The refactoring patch needs to be fully integration tested first when time permits.
