This does not seem to be needed, as long as the task tag literal value does not
change (that is, changing from WORK to WK - or adding WK for that matter -
clearly calls for a new analysis of all source files; removing WK could skip
this; changing the importance of already indexed WORK instances should not
trigger a new analysis either.)

The user scenario that is ampered by this behavior is the following. Assuming
that I work with many sources and a handful of task tags (say WORK for work is
needed right now, REVIEW for seeking peer advice, PREMATURE for postponed work,
ADDTEST...), and I want to switch activities rapidly, I need a way to tell the
tasks filter to present me with the information I want, even when it may combine
several tags (say WORK and REVIEW). I thought that the priority would fit nicely
here (use High priority for what you want to focus on), but it doesn't because
of the full rebuild. 
I may miss other ways to tune the filter that would help here (for example,
having an OR operator in the contains part of the filter), in which case this
bug should only be regarded as a suggestion for performance improvement.
