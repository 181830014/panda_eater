It doesn't seem to be possible to properly return an empty result for an Icon query (e.g. "Type Icon" in uiCustom). Both "" (Empty string) and null are treated as invalid results, and display an error in the log.

There should probably be a test, so that either "" or null simply correspond to a null Image, which is not an error (Sometimes, the Image is facultative).

This is a problem in the case of a Customizable Label Provider: when the value is invalid, the provider delegates to EMF for retrieving the default Image associated the EObject's metaclass, while we may want a "Null image" instead.
