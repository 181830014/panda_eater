I have a simple project and a number of plugin and feature projects in my 
workspace. I happen to have a dirty feature editor open and am trying to move 
(drag) a file from one dir to another in the simple project.  When I do, I get 
a dialog saying that all files must be saved before the operation can be done.  
This is strange.  the project is in no way related to anything else in the 
workspace.  I should be free to do what I want.  In any event, what does moving 
one file have to do with any other file and whether or not it is dirty in an 
editor?

If there is some valid reason for this dialog, users should be given the option 
to just do it anyway.  The current dialog offers to turn this checking off 
competely but, assuming there is a reason for it in the first place, it seems 
harsh to just turn it off.

(yes, it happens that I do not want ot save that dirty editor so basically I 
cannot move the file I need to and have to go and find it in the Explorer and 
move it there)
