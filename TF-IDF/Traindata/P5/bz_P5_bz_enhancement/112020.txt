Large lists in "referenced by" nodes can easily make Active Search useless for most of
the time. 

I think that the major problem is that this node expanded automatically.
If we can have "smart expand" for this case, so it won't expand it under certain conditions
(e.g. more then 3 refferals or number of landmrks in current context is over 15) it should
significantly change situation.
