From the original 3.1 undo proposal:

Undo and Redo on the toolbar should include a drop down that shows the 
operation history.  This history depends on the current partâ€™s context.

            operationHistory.getUndoHistoryFor(myContext);

The drop down permits range selection of operations from the top down (see MS 
Word and other applications).  This UI implies a linear undo within any 
particular set of contexts.  While the selection of a range of undo operations 
is not considered that valuable, the ability to see the history is considered 
valuable.

- This feature was deferred in 3.1 but was never captured in a bug report.
