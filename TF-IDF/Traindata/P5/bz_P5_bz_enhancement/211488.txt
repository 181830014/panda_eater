Currently, you cannot use the Source -> Implement/Override feature on interfaces.  Enable this feature on interfaces, because the following use cases are possible:

1. Narrow return types of methods.  I believe this has been allowed since Java 1.5
2. Add a "throws" declaration of a RuntimeException
3. Remove declaration of Exceptions

The two interfaces below demonstrate these cases:

--
import java.awt.AWTException;
public interface Interface
{
    public Interface method() throws IllegalArgumentException, AWTException [3];
}
--
public interface SubInterface extends Interface
{
    public SubInterface [1] method() throws UnsupportedOperationException [2];
}

It is arguable about how useful 2 and 3 are, but 1 is definitely useful.
