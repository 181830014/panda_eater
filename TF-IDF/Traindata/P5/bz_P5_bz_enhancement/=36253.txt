2.1

It would be nice to be able to search for text in the Javadoc of types and 
members, and have the matches be presented in terms of Java members.
Alternatively, searching the whole body of a Java declaration would be fine.

What I was actually trying to do was to find all types and methods with "@since 
2.1".  I had to use text search, which only gives the matches in terms of the 
files, not the individual declarations.

More specialized support for searching Javadoc tags is another possibility.  
E.g. search for "2.1" in all @since tags.
