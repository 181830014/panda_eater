When the project is created by New Project wizard, the wizard prompts the user 
and switches to the predefined perspective.
Import wizards sometimes creates new project in the workspace but these do not 
have function to change the perspective.
org.eclipse.ui.importWizard extension point needs to support finalPerspective 
option as well as org.eclipse.ui.newWizards extension point.
