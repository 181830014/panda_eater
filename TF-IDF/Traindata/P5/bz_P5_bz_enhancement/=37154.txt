One of my biggest gripes with CVS is the lack of directory metadata.

Subversion is a version control system which is very similar to CVS, except it
tries to fix a number of the CVS shortcomings such as the lack of directory
metadata. http://subversion.tigris.org/

The CVS integration in eclipse is one of the best CVS client implementations I
have seen, and I would love to have an eclipse subversion integration that
worked as well as the CVS one.

Since there is a fair amount of overlap in behavior between CVS and subversion,
it probably wouldn't be that hard to rework the cvs plugins to add support for
subversion.  Obviously, this would be a lot easier for the people that wrote the
cvs plugins than for someone starting from scratch that had to learn the
existing code.
