Allow automation of common tasks. To make it easier for users to automate 
common and repetitive tasks, the user should have a simple way of recording 
the sequence of actions as they perform them. The recording can be edited, 
saved persistently, and played back under similar circumstances in the same or 
later session, or possibly another workspace. [Platform UI, Platform Core,
