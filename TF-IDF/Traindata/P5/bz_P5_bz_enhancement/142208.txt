The "Last modified" time for files in the RSE Properties View is filled from IHostFile.getModifiedDate(), which has semantics same as Java File.lastModified(): seconds since the Epoch, GMT.

Essentially for a remote system we do not know what time zone the remote system runs in, so we need to display time information in a common format such as UTC or GMT.

What's confusing for the user, is that when he types e.g. ls -l in a remote shell, times are displayed in the remote system's time zone. So they do not match what the Properties view shows.

Therefore, the Properties View should indicate that the times displayed are in GMT, e.g.
  April 6, 2006 10:40:33 AM GMT

This could be accomplished by doing Date.toGMTString() instead of Date.toString(), or the equivalent from DateFormat.format().
