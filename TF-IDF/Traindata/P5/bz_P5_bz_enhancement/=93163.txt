The following feature would be very handy:
Select multiple files (resources) in view, and copy their full-filenames 
(including path, either fullqualified either relatively to the 
workspace/project) in the clipboard.
I would like this feature to work in several views especially in:
1. Resource explorer
2. Java Package Explorer
3. Team Synchronize - Synchronize view
4. CVS Commit/Update views.

The reason why I need them - sometimes I need the list of modified resources 
and the easiest and fastest way for me to get this list - take it from one of 
the Team Synchronized views.
