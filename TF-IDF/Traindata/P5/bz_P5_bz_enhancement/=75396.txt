Our users did not realize (for some reason) to click on go to Workbench arrow 
to make intro (new welcome page) in "stand by" move. Instead they to switch to 
the perspective that is already open. Can we put some logic that would mode 
intro from full to stand by mode if user tries to switch to the already opened 
perspective?

There is already this logic when you switch to another perspective, so you need 
to move this code “up” a bit, before the check for perspective being already 
active.

Thanks
