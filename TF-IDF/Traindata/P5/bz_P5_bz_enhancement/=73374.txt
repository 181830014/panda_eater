For some theme definitions, they are used as optional preferences. For example,
if CVS supported color and fonts for the decorations the user could decide if
they wanted to use colors and fonts. A definition with an optional
enabled/disabled checkbox would allow this to be shown to the user. 

Without this support, from the fonts and colors page it looks like all settings
are used at all times. And changing one of the definitions will result in a
change to the UI. This is not always the case because the colors and fonts may
be enabled from another preference page.
