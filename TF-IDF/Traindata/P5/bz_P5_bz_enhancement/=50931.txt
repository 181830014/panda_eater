The views that show inheritance (e.g. eclipse type hierarchy, XDE static 
structure diagram) need to be augmented to show how aspects affect this 
inheritance structure.  For example, if an aspect declares a new parent on a 
class, the corresponding tree or UML view should show this new link, and 
should point to the aspect declaration that caused it.  A mock-up is attached.
