Hi Gr√©goire, 
  in Papyrus, we try to make synchronized table with the context of the table. In order to do that, we need to have a method addRows(List<?> element>) and a method (removeRows(List<?> elements)) which don't use the command stack. I think there is at least 2 ways to get that : 
  		- the nattableWidget could provide these methods
or 	- the TableInstanceCommandFactory could be accessble (and not in Internal) to get these commands.
or ?

I know this feature needs changes in your API, so it won't be done before 2012.
For this year, we use a PapyrusWidget which extends yours.

Best regards,
