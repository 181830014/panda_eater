In some cases the substituted keywords, notably the $Id$-keyword, will exceed
the maximum line width. In this cases the formatter will add a line break which
inhibits CVS from recognizing the keyword.
That means every CVS keyword (in the edited files) has to be checked manually
prior to commiting.

Please add an option to exclude CVS keywords from formatting.

An even better option would be the ability to exclude lines that match a given
pattern.
