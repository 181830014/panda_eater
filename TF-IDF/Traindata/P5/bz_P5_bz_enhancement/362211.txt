I create a C# to KDM transformation. I am going to support the code and action package. For this purpose, I use MoDisco's KDMSourceDiscoverer to produce the InventoryModel of the underlying filesystem. However, There is no possibility to, e.g., count a specific type of read files, say SourceFiles. Furthermore, I cannot display the progress while construction the InventoryModel, because I, again, have no access on the single read files/folders.
I propose two listener, one before the next file/folder is read and one after it is read. Since you already check whether the given file is a file or a folder, you could provide these two listeners for a read file as well as for a read directory.
Within these listeners, you can do whatever you want with it, e.g., display the current progress.

Please let me know whether you could implement and release this extension to the "inventory model parser" in the next month.

Regards,
Christian
