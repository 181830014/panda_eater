Currently, array initializers have a special setting to prevent any newlines in
the declaration (keeping them on the same line instead of putting a newline
after the initial brace).

Enums should behave the same way. The current formatting for enums declarations
mimicks a method or class declaration, and does not allow the declaration to be
kept on the same line. Compare to
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html, where all enum
declarations are wrapped only on demand, never after the opening brace.
