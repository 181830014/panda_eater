Eclipse puts up modal requesters with some information and a single "OK" button.

E.g. "Could not contact the CVS server" [OK].

It is very annoying to have focus stolen from the editor I'm currently working
in. Even more annoying if I click the wrong spot and accidentally send the modal
dialog box to back. (Can happen w/GTK + Xming X server).

Perhaps something akin to the "MSN Messenger" non-focus-stealing, non-modal
notifications that something is amiss, with a possiblity to go and examine the
modal dialog box queue at a later time.

Incidentally it would be nice to be able to copy&paste the text in the error
message, which I'm not sure you can directly from the modal dialog box.
