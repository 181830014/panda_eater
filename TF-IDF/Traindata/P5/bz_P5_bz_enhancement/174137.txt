In JDT, when you comment or uncomment one line code used "Toggle Comment" menu item, 
the "//" always be added the header of the line. But I think the most developer 
needs another style. Please see the following.

Current Style:
	if (a > b) {
			method1();
//		Invoke method2..
			method2();
	}
	
Expected Style:
	if (a > b) {
			method1();
			// Invoke method2.
			method2();
	}  	
	
So I think you can add a new feature for this. Thanks!
