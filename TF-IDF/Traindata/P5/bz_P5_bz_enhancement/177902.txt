Every so often I have a report that contains a table of elements that I want to link off. However, the destination for each row is different as the reporting requirements for each row is not the same.

What I need is a mechanism to map a specific row (based on data in any column)  to different reports. The DataItemEventAdapter would be ideal; however, there is no way to access the hyperlink detail in the onRender or onCreate events.

e.g

row a -> report 1
row b -> report 2
row c -> report 1
row d -> report 1
row e -> report 2
