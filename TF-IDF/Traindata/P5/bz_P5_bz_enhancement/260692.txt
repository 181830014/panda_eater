Build ID: I20080617-2000

Steps To Reproduce:
1. The user activates a given task;
2. MyLyn calls some script/command with variable as arguments upon this task activation;
3. The script makes wonderful and unimaginable things =)


More information:
It would be great if it was possible to configure commands/scripts to be executed every time the user activates or deactivates a given task. Something like the "External tools" where you specify the location, working directory and arguments for the command/script.

This started as a post in the newsgroup:

The commands/scripts could be whether global (all tasks), per task repository or per task. I'm just thinking loud over it =)

Thanks,
Pablo.
