Hello,
I would like to suggest the following enhancement (I'll try to be clear :-( )
It could be good to add a new dialog box mode based uppon the statefull modal
dialog box, ie the dialog box with next/previous choices ...
The proposal is to render the dialog box like a perspective with states
(next/previous/ok/cancel). 
Example :
When we open the state perspective, this one is blocked in the current state. We
can't change the current perspective unless we choose the cancel or ok button...
In certain case, we would have only next/previous button...  I think such a
state perspective should be useful for some kind of applications
