its a pretty usefull tool in eclipse , and i like first to thanks the eclipse
team :)

however, i'd like to know if it is possible for a next release to have :
1) in the code formatting/cleaning tool, for the "white space" features, add the
features : "add white space before/after a DOT (.) " (like it does for commas
(,) etc ...)
1) in the code formatting/cleaning tool, for the "blank lines features", add the
feature : "leave a blank line at the very and of the java file" (for now the
tool just leave a "}" at the end, and i like a "}"+"line feed" )

very uncommon request indeed :p

'just hope it could be made :)
