When contexts gets very large views can become overpopulated.  The interest
threshold can be used to control view population, but is currently not exposed
in any UI.  The most convenient place to expose it is probably in a "fit to
view" button on the package explorer.  Currently the filter is a slider on the
context control panel, which is in the sandbox and not exposed.  The slider
could be added to a "Context" section of the Task Editor.  It will be essential
once we provide cascading contexts (e.g. the aggregate workspace context), and
will be useful for limiting elements in visualizations.
