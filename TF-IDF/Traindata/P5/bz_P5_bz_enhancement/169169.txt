2.0M3 (Similar but more generic than #141548, which is closed)

A model (such as QVT that extends EMOF) cannot be satisfactorily
processed by StructureBuilder because not all EClasses are in the same
EPackage or even the same Resource.

An Ecore model comprises EClasses which could each be in a distinct
EPackage which could each be in a distinct Resource.

The iteration in StructureBuilder.process should iterate transitively
over all referenced EClasses and all their super and sub classes.

Suggestion: in order to constrain the subsequent user entry, a per-EPackage
include/exclude check-box would be helpful.
