Project policy is that all methods (public, private or otherwise) must be fully javadoc'd, while members are only doc'd if they are public constants.

Eclipse does not differentiate between methods and members, however, meaning I have to leave its doc checking off (and use Checkstyle). It would be nice if Eclipse had this flexibility.
