The evaluation of pointcuts refering to annotations can be done statically. However the AspectJ compiler is not capable of doing so. Compiling
@TypeLevel(2)
public aspect Alpha {
	void around(): (adviceexecution()
		&& @within(TypeLevel)
		&& if(TypeLevel.value() < 2))
		|| execution (* *(..)) {
			System.out.println("Test");
		}
	}

will result in an error. However it would be desirable if the AspectJ Compiler would evaluate these pointcuts at compiletime.
