Most of our public API now takes List, however internally we mainly use Vector and Hashtable still.  This has caused us concurrency issues before (we now use NonSyncronizedVector), and still causes a minor performance overhead.  It also looks very bad as Vector is a class from JDK 1.1 that has been undesirable since.  This issue has been raised in public forums by people critiquing our code quality.
