With the AspectJ 1.5.0M5 compiler, an inter-type field declaration of type int with an initializer is not type-checked to prevent an attempt to assign null into the field by default.  The result is a VerifyError at runtime.

Is this the intended behavior?  I couldn't find any evidence in the AspectJ documentation that initializers on inter-type field declarations should not be type checked, but I can't admit to being particularly experienced with AspectJ.

Here is code that reproduces the problem:

------------------
// Foo.java
public class Foo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Foo f = new Foo();
    }
}
------------------
// Bar.java
public aspect Bar {
    public int Foo.x = null;
}
------------------
I compiled the code with the following command:

    ajc -1.5 -source 1.5 Foo.java Bar.java
