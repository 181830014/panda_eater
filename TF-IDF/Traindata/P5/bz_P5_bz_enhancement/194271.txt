Introduce some validation regarding Javadoc location.
According to Sun spec http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/javadoc.html#wheretags
not all tags are valid anywhere in the Java Source.
I'll attach a sample project to illustrate Javadoc location issues.

2 options here:
- conform with Javadoc tool behavior
- raise warning/errors as spec'd http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/javadoc.html#wheretags
