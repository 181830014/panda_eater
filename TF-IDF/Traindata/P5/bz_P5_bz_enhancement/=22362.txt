I would like to be able to define an Exclusive working set instead of an 
Inclusive one.  That is, I want my working set to be "Everything that is not in 
the following projects/packages/folders".  That would allow my filters to show 
new things as they are added, or to exclude a particularly troublesome 
package/prject/source folder from the various filteted views without having to 
update it everytime I add something to my project/workspace.  

Please see:  bug 14441  (Task filtering).  A common use case here is you have 
one troublesome thing that produces thousands of errors.  Would be useful to 
just exclude that one thing rather than trying to include everything else.
