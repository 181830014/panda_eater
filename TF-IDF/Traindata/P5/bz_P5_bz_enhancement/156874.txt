My situation is the following: I am automatically processing a huge code base with the ASTRewriter, and in some cases I do not want that comments are deleted when the neighbouring statements are.

So, my wish would be to allow more flexibility. I don't really care how it is realized, but I would propose a strategy pattern, so that anybody can implement an own CommentMapping strategy object and influence the behaviour as needed. This way everybody can decide, which comments will move or delete together with the neighbouring node, and which comments stay in place.
