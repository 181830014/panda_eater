Where source code is generated by tools (idlj, Castor, XDoclet, etc.) this is 
usually picked up by configuring source folders to point at the tool output. 
Often, this code generates warnings with certain compiler settings (typically, 
unused imports, no serialVersionUID, etc.).

It would be useful to allow different sets of compiler settings for different 
source folders in order to minimise the number of warnings reported.
