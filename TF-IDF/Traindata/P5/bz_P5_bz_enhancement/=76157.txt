I often search for files with a special meaning to Windows but not to Eclipse,
which Eclipse then delegates to Windows to open.  An example is a PNG-file,
where I basically do not want to work with the contents but the directory
containing the file.

I therefore type in the file name, and see several folders where this file
exist.  i would then like to be able to right click on the folders and be able
to in some way work with the folder.  Examples coul dbe:

* Show file in Navigator.
* Open folder in Windows or Navigator
* Just the "Open with..." functionality seen elsewhere.
