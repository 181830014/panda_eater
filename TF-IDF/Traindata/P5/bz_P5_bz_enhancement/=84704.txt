Would like a way to export a project from the workspace, including it's local
history (from metadata). Of course, would also like to import a previously
exported project into a different workspace with the local history intact.

Basically, I'd like to enhance the current freedom of moving projects between
workspaces to avoid losing all their local history in the process.

Note that the export/import of local history is mentioned in the original
description of Bug 3101, but then seems not to be addressed further.
