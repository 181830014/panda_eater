From time to time I am using local tasks to prototype something before creating tasks in repository. It seem natural to use the same summary for the derived repository task (in the future we may provide some level to automate such promotion). However those tasks can't be differentiated. Because changesets in Synchronize view and task history drop downs don't show task id local and repository task look exactly the same and making big confusion.
