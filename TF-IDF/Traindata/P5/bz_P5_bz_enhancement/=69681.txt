Since I sometimes want to use the built-in Java editor, and sometimes an
external editor (which shall remain nameless), I would like a menu item in one
of the editor menus to open the file in whatever external editor(s) I've defined
(with Windows > Preferences > Workbench > File Associations).

This would be different from the one in the Navigator telling which editor I
want to open a given file with; this is for situations where I'm working in the
internal editor and realize that an external editor could do what I want more
quickly.
