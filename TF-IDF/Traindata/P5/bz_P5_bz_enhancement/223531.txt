Patch to make subprograms return parameters as children.

I think it would be a good addition to the Outline View if the parameters for subprograms (procedures and functions) would be shown as children. I know that the Eclipse JDT doesn't do this for Java but I think that it would be helpful for Ada programmers to have this. If parameters were children in the outline view, a programmer could quickly see the mode of parameters (in, out, or in out).

I describe the rationale in a different way in the blog post mentioned at the URL given.

I attached a patch that would make this enhancement possible. It does not contain the logic that would need to added to the UI to make the mode visible in the outline view - it simply makes the model return the parameters as children.
