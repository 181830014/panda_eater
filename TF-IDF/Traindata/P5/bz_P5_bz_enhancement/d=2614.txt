From Soonthorn Ativanichayaphong posting in the eclipse news group.
	Topic title in news group is "How to disable the rightclick menu on FileResource"

	To summarize, when the option "Open With > System Editor" is selected on a file
	resource, the following error message is displayed if there are no system editor
	for the file type.
		"Unable to open external editor for <filename>"
	This seems to be a bit confusing for some people. They would prefer a message
	indicating that there is no application registered for the file type on the system. Or
	do like Windows does, and open a dialog and let the user choose the system editor
	to use (just like when you double click on a file in the file system).
