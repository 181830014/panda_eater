It would be really cool to have a "lucene powered" duplicate detection where lucene's fuzzy, proximity and range searches could be used.
Please see http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/queryparsersyntax.html#Fuzzy%20Searches for more information.
This would require to build a lucene index on top of the bug-db. Maybe this is out of focus, but it would be really helpful I think, not only for duplicate detection but for querying in general
If it is out of focus just close it ;-)
