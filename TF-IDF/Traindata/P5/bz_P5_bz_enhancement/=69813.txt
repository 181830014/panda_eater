It would be very nice to have an eclipse command that will insert the proper 
end tag for the lastest open tag in javadoc comments.

This could be implemented by putting this end tag at the head of the quick fix 
list.

E.g. if the cursor is placed at [] below, this new command will insert </em>.

/**
 * ...
 *
 * This will <em>not[]
