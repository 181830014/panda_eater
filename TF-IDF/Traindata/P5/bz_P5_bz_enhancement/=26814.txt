It is possible to add references to JavaDoc fields/methods of a class using the # modifier: java.util.Vector#<Ctrl+sp> brings up a list of methods in Vector. However, it would be useful if as well as responding to #, it also responds to '.' and: java.util.Vector.<Ctrl+sp> would bring up the same list in JavaDoc.
Obviously in this case it would be necessary to replace the '.' with a #, but 
it would probably be easier for Java developers to type '.' for the auto-completion.

[On Mac keyboards, there is also currently no way of inserting a # -- 26778 -- so it would be especially useful for us :-) ]
