The source appears like this when I first encounter it:
   /**
    * The "OK" button.
    */
   private JButton okButton;

I'd like to be able to format it so that it appears like this:
   /** The "OK" button. */
   private JButton okButton;

NOTE, this should only happen if the comment opening and closing markers and the
description all fit within the specified line length limit.  If they do not, the
first way is still used.
