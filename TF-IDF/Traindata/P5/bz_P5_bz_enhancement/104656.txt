A width hint for the button is computed using the convertHorizontalDLUsToPixels
() method, then we ask the button to compute its size using the SWT default 
sizes.  Then we take the max of the two.  We should probably just call 
computeSize with the width hint we computed instead of the SWT default.  Then 
we don't have to take the max of 2 values.

A similar method is implemented as a private method in class 
CreateLinkedResourceGroup, so need to look at this one too.
