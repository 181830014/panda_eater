I would like to add the following to the JPAHelper.getReadAllQuery method (also referenced from getReportQuery) to make it clear that the underlying EclipseLink query is cached and that any changes made will effect all dynamic queries with the same JPQL string.


	 * Queries created through EntityManager.createQuery(jpqlSting) are cached
	 * by the provided query string. It is important that the cached query's
	 * state is not changed unless these changes are to be applied in all
	 * executions of the provided query string. If unique configuration is 
	 * required using the native query API then use the JpaHelper.createQuery
	 * method with a query object instanted with the native API.
	 * 
	 * @see JpaHelper#createQuery(ReadAllQuery, javax.persistence.EntityManager)
	 */
	public static ReadAllQuery getReadAllQuery(Query query) {
