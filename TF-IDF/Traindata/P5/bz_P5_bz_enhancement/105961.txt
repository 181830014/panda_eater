In the statusline the font can be set (through the control gotten from StatusLineManger), but foreground-
background colors are rigidly fixed in the code of StatusLine. The latter class has package scope and 
therefore not easily accessible or extendable. 
Neither have I been able to adapt the height of the statusline (seems fixed at its inception) in order to fully 
accomodate all the icons I would like to see there.

I would like to see such an ordering of setting the default colors of the statusline, that like for the font 
user setting is honored.

More difficult perhaps the wish to be able to apply StatusLineLayoutData (height and width especially) to 
the statusline layout. Now its layout is perhaps a little too much shielded.
