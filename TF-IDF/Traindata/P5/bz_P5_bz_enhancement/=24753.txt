It would be useful if the Bookmark view had "Show Next" and "Show Previous" 
buttons just like the Search view has.

Also on the subject of inconsistency...the "Delete" button is a red X on the 
Bookmark view and the Task view, but is a horizontal blue bar on the Search 
view and the Breakpoints view.)
