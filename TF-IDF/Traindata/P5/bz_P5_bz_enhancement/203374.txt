Quoting from the mailing list:
Omry:
Is there a way to view completed tasks grouped by days?
This can be useful if I want to see what tasks (repo and local) I have
finished since some data and will help creating release notes.

Mik:
There is, although it is somewhat limited.  Put the Task List into the Scheduled presentation (toolbar dropdown), turn off the Focused mode (toolbar button), and turn off the filtering of completed tasks (view menu). 

Omry:
I have already seen this, and it's not enough - at least not at the
version of mylyn I am using (2.0, attempting to upgrade now).
the reason it's not enough is that it's focusing on the future, and
shows show more detailed breakdown for the future, while the past is
grouped into Previous-week and past.
Most of the tasks on my project are local, and what I really want is the
ability to see all the local tasks closed since a particular date.
anything beyond it (like repo tasks) would be nice.
maybe this best be implemented as more power to the task search.

Robert:
Perhaps. We could start with adding this filter to the Task Activity Report available in the sanbox via the Extras update site. Please submit a new bug report with your particular use case and we can iterate there.
