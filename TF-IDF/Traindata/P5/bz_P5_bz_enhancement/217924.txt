When auto-detecting the database platform the DBPlatformHelper must ensure that the platform selected is available. In the case of the most recent Oracle platforms they may not be available due to dependencies or the lack of the oracle extension project. Ideally the database version information would be used to find more specifically what database platform to use or if this is not possible simply start at the most recent and work backwards down the hierarchy until one is found that can be loaded.

Also note that the logged diagnostics while searching through the platforms are not terribly meaningful to customers. Only useful in debugging the patern matches tried.
