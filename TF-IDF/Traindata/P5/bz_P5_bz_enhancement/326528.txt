My application is comprised of several Java projects. I multi-selected the projects, right-clicked and selected "MoDisco > Discover Java model from Java project".
I would have expected all the code in the selected projects to be discovered, and a single model to be created.
Instead, I got 7 windows that popped-up. One for each project.
